It’s not a huge amount, but taking their Venezuela 🇻🇪 production off the market will cause a disruption in this “private” market they have been stocking up on.

Still have some limit orders if it drops more and will continue to load up. Quick math but I I own (65 contracts x $6 07 x 9x leverage per contract ) That’s like $355,000 of oil futures. It’s a lot of fun with the leverage! 1% in either directions and it’s like $5-10k. 🥭 might go on TV, nuke the Venezuela tankers, and we see a 2-3% movement no problem. This is any easy play. I have 3 months to wait this this out for a $20,000-30,000 gain if it hit $60+",

      "title": "Rate my pivot: Moving from a Cash/Tech barbell to a macro-hedged setup for 2026. Does this logic hold up?",
      "selftext": "I’m currently managing a mid-7-figure portfolio that’s done well, but it’s basically a \"barbell\" right now: 1/3 cash and nearly 1/2 heavy tech concentration. With the Fed cutting and the 2026 outlook looking messy (deficits, tariffs, etc), I'm trying to move from passive holding into a more defensive macro setup. Current mess: - 43% Tech/Nasdaq (QQQ plus heavy single stock exposure in Mag 7) - 31% Cash (mostly SPAXX/Money Market at 5%) - 20% S&P 500 - 6% International (Total world) The Issues: 1. Cash drag: 31% in cash as rates drop to 3-3.5% is just asking for income erosion. 2. Overlap: Owning QQQ plus individual tech names is redundant. 3. China risk: My current international fund is weighed down by China, which I want out of for 2026. Proposed New Target: I’m planning to dump the Nasdaq index and broad international funds to clean up the overlap and China risk, then move the bulk of the cash into intermediate bonds and some \"real economy\" hedges. 33% - High Conviction Tech (Single names only): Retaining my highest conviction plays directly to avoid the \"fluff\" in QQQ. I see these as cash flow plays that are safer than the broader index. 20% - S&P 500 (IVV): My boring core. 18% - Intermediate Corp Bonds (VCIT): Moving the cash here to lock in ~4.8% yields and get some capital appreciation as the Fed continues to cut. Preferring corporates over treasuries for the extra cushion. 9% - Mid-Cap Value (VOE): This is my \"real economy\" play. Targets industrials/financials that should benefit from onshoring and a steeper yield curve. Helps me diversify away from the Mag 7. 8% - EM ex-China (VEXC): Swapping broad international for EM excluding China. I want the growth in India/Vietnam/Taiwan without the China drag. 7% - Cash (SPAXX): Just keeping some dry powder for emergencies/opportunities. 5% - Bitcoin (IBIT): Hedge against fiscal debasement/deficits. Questions for you guys: 1. Is moving that much cash into VCIT (Intermediate Corps) the right way to play the rate cycle, or is the credit risk too high if things get recessionary? 2. Is the Ex-China (VEXC) play actually effective for international growth, or should I just stick to developed markets? Appreciate any thoughts or sanity checks on this.",

      "selftext": "Elon, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia all have made public statements about the future of ai compute in space. They have gone well beyond speculation and well on their way to building out this tech. The appeal is simple: energy costs in space are far cheaper. All the costs of cooling are gone since the vacuum of space absorbs the heat. And solar power is available 24 hours and at a higher intensity than on earth. Imo, the best way to get in the weeds on the economics and technology of these constellations is Google’s \\~20 page research paper: [ **Why Now?** I believe the SpaceX IPO will put this theme into hyperdrive. Elon is potentially raising 30b through the IPO, that will be incredible fuel to finance a constellation of AI compute satellites. All other contenders will have to step up and match that in some way – the same way they have done with every other aspect of the AI race. Identifying an input to ai centers before the markets has yielded nearly all of the best trades of the past bull market: cpus, ram, gas turbines, nuclear power sites, cooling equipment, interconnects, etc. Much of this stuff is on backorder for years. **Space solar is the next domino to fall.** From what I understand the two purest plays on this are ASTI and RDW. Before we go into it, it is important to realize that space solar is different that terrestrial solar – in that what is needed for space is (a) solar that can be stored compactly for launch, and (b) has a high output per unit of weight. This is very different from terrestrial solar, where much of the tech and cost is put into scaffolding to hold up rather heavy panels. **Redwire** Redwire is perhaps the leader in ROSA (Roll Out Solar Arrays). This is a system where compact panels are folded for flight and then unfolded in space. This tech has already been successfully deployed in several missions. [ The only other company that I know of that is a pure play in space solar is too small to mention in this sub, but I have covered it in other posts. If anyone knows other ways to play this theme I am all ears.",

      "selftext_processed": "Elon Google Microsoft Amazon and Nvidia all have made public statements about the future of ai compute in space . They have gone well beyond speculation and well on their way to building out this tech . The appeal is simple energy costs in space are far cheaper . All the costs of cooling are gone since the vacuum of space absorbs the heat . And solar power is available 24 hours and at a higher intensity than on earth . Imo the best way to get in the weeds on the economics and technology of these constellations is Google ’ s 20 page research paper Why Now I believe the SpaceX IPO will put this theme into hyperdrive . Elon is potentially raising 30b through the IPO that will be incredible fuel to finance a constellation of AI compute satellites . All other contenders will have to step up and match that in some way – the same way they have done with every other aspect of the AI race . Identifying an input to ai centers before the markets has yielded nearly all of the best trades of the past bull market cpus ram gas turbines nuclear power sites cooling equipment interconnects etc . Much of this stuff is on backorder for years . Space solar is the next domino to fall . From what I understand the two purest plays on this are ASTI and RDW . Before we go into it it is important to realize that space solar is different that terrestrial solar – in that what is needed for space is a solar that can be stored compactly for launch and b has a high output per unit of weight . This is very different from terrestrial solar where much of the tech and cost is put into scaffolding to hold up rather heavy panels . Redwire Redwire is perhaps the leader in ROSA Roll Out Solar Arrays . This is a system where compact panels are folded for flight and then unfolded in space . This tech has already been successfully deployed in several missions . The only other company that I know of that is a pure play in space solar is too small to mention in this sub but I have covered it in other posts . If anyone knows other ways to play this theme I am all ears ."

      "selftext": "TL;DR: Everything we predicted is actually happening. The borrow pool saw a ridiculous 2.45M shares returned, meaning shorts were forced to cover. The price jumped 20% in 2 days even though they were trying to sell hard, and now we have a gamma squeeze getting stacked on top of the FTD deadline. This post is the play-by-play on why they are completely boxed in. PART 1: The Proof Is In The Numbers You don't need a finance degree to see this. The data is slamming the door shut on the short thesis. The Borrow Pool Smokescreen Blew Up Yesterday (Dec 16th), 16 minutes before the market opened, something beautiful happened Dec 15th evening there was 600k shares Dec 16 8:32 am there’s was no 3 million shares That's 2.45 million shares dumped back into the pool in one 15-minute chunk. Listen, shares only show up in the pool when someone returns them. And they only return them when they cover (buy back the shares they sold short). That was a forced closing event, plain and simple. They were scrambling. They sold hard but the price went back up anyway Look at the short volume data from FINRA. This is crazy Dec 12 short volume ratio was 38.41 percent and the price move was -10% Dec 16th short volume ratio was 68.48% but the price move this time was +9% They doubled their selling intensity (from 38% to 66% short volume) and the price went the opposite way, shooting up 9%. This only happens if: The buyers (us, and the MMs forced to hedge) are so overwhelming that the shorts' selling efforts are a drop in the bucket. They're out of effective ammo. Now for the next part which is the shorts nightmare, because they aren’t just SHORT they’re TRAPPED Their entry is 7$ Shares owed is 10 million Real shares available to buy is only 3.5 million( due to the mccann families massive locked up stake in the company, the ppl who started the buisness) They need to buy back roughly 3X the entire float. They can't get out unless we sell. And we're not selling for $5. But here’s the thing the FTD deadline is NOW They used tricks and options in October to kick the can down the road, creating a pile of failures to deliver(ftd) that are due this week. Dec 16th : 27k shares Dec 17th: 300k Dec 18th: 200k These aren't optional. Reg SHO forces them to deliver these shares. This creates non-stop, mechanical buying pressure. NOW this is the triple threat squeeze right here This isn't a single-mechanism play. It's a compounding system. 1. FTD forced to buy back \\to Lifts Price. 2. Price Lifts \\to Puts the $5 call strike in play (that's the biggest options position). 3. $5 strike in play to Market Makers are forced to buy more stock to hedge the calls they sold (gamma squeeze) 4.the gamma buying to Lifts the price even higher, hitting shorts with margin calls (Traditional Short Squeeze). They all feed each other. That's how you get 20% moves against 66% short volume. The $5 strike is the nuclear trigger. If we breach that and hold, the MMs' forced hedging turns into a massive accelerant. Part 4 of this theory: why 31% short interst is bs The number you see on Finviz is a lie. Reported SI: 31 Real SI (after passive funds removed): 94%-135% Effective SI (after retail buyingholding): 118% and rising We (the retail holders) are actively shrinking the supply of shares they can buy. Every share we hold is a brick in the wall. The smaller the \"Effective Float\" gets, the faster and higher the squeeze goes. The squeeze doesn't happen at 31%. It happens at 118%+ effective SI. My Final Take for Today (Dec 17) All the signals are green. The key things to watch: 1. The $5 Test: If we break and hold $5, get ready for volume to crank up as Market Makers are forced to pile in and hedge. 2. Borrow Desk: Check the shares available throughout the day. If it keeps dipping toward zero or huge chunks appear (like the 2.45M yesterday), it means forced covering is still happening. They thought this was an easy short at $7. Now they are pinned. Their only way out is if we panic sell. Position: Holding strong. 155 calls and 400 shares. Not financial advice, just the play as I see it.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Everything we predicted is actually happening . The borrow pool saw a ridiculous 2.45M shares returned meaning shorts were forced to cover . The price jumped 20 % in 2 days even though they were trying to sell hard and now we have a gamma squeeze getting stacked on top of the FTD deadline . This post is the playbyplay on why they are completely boxed in . PART 1 The Proof Is In The Numbers You dont need a finance degree to see this . The data is slamming the door shut on the short thesis . The Borrow Pool Smokescreen Blew Up Yesterday Dec 16th 16 minutes before the market opened something beautiful happened Dec 15th evening there was 600k shares Dec 16 832 am there ’ s was no_3 million shares Thats 2.45 million shares dumped back into the pool in one 15minute chunk . Listen shares only show up in the pool when someone returns them . And they only return them when they cover buy back the shares they sold short . That was a forced closing event plain and simple . They were scrambling . They sold hard but the price went back up anyway Look at the short volume data from FINRA . This is crazy Dec 12 short volume ratio was 38.41 percent and the price move was 10 % Dec 16th short volume ratio was 68.48 % but the price move this time was 9 % They doubled their selling intensity from 38 % to 66 % short volume and the price went the opposite way shooting up 9 % . This only happens if The buyers us and the MMs forced to hedge are so overwhelming that the shorts selling efforts are a drop in the bucket . Theyre out of effective ammo . Now for the next part which is the shorts nightmare because they aren ’ t just SHORT they ’ re TRAPPED Their entry is 7 $ Shares owed is 10 million Real shares available to buy is only 3.5 million due to the mccann families massive locked up stake in the company the ppl who started the buisness They need to buy back roughly 3X the entire float . They cant get out unless we sell . And were not_selling for $ 5 . But here ’ s the thing the FTD deadline is NOW They used tricks and options in October to kick the can down the road creating a pile of failures to deliverftd that are due this week . Dec 16th 27k shares Dec 17th 300k Dec 18th 200k These arent optional . Reg SHO forces them to deliver these shares . This creates nonstop mechanical buying pressure . NOW this is the triple threat squeeze right here This isnt a singlemechanism play . Its a compounding system . 1 . FTD forced to buy back to Lifts Price . 2 . Price Lifts to Puts the $ 5 call strike in play thats the biggest options position . 3 . $ 5 strike in play to Market Makers are forced to buy more stock to hedge the calls they sold gamma squeeze 4.the gamma buying to Lifts the price even higher hitting shorts with margin calls Traditional Short Squeeze . They all feed each other . Thats how you get 20 % moves against 66 % short volume . The $ 5 strike is the nuclear trigger . If we breach that and hold the MMs forced hedging turns into a massive accelerant . Part 4 of this theory why 31 % short interst is bs The number you see on Finviz is a lie . Reported SI 31 Real SI after passive funds removed 94 % 135 % Effective SI after retail buyingholding 118 % and rising We the retail holders are actively shrinking the supply of shares they can buy . Every share we hold is a brick in the wall . The smaller the Effective Float gets the faster and higher the squeeze goes . The squeeze doesnt happen at 31 % . It happens at 118 % effective SI . My Final Take for Today Dec 17 All the signals are green . The key things to watch 1 . The $ 5 Test If we break and hold $ 5 get ready for volume to crank up as Market Makers are forced to pile in and hedge . 2 . Borrow Desk Check the shares available throughout the day . If it keeps dipping toward zero or huge chunks appear like the 2.45M yesterday it means forced covering is still happening . They thought this was an easy short at $ 7 . Now they are pinned . Their only way out is if we panic sell . Position Holding strong . 155 calls and 400 shares . Not_financial advice just the play as I see it ."

Has anyone else done the same? Should I reallocate everything to VT instead or just keep doing what I've been doing? International lagged behind for a long time but this year was obviously different. Or would switching now be a bad move? Not really sure what to do.",

      "selftext": "December 16 (Reuters) Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors may announce its decision on Paramount Sky Dance's $108.4 billion acquisition offer as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. The board is expected to recommend shareholders vote against the bid. The renewed acceptance of Netflix's acquisition offer marks the latest development in this bidding war. The target of this contest includes Warner Bros.' storied film and television studio, along with its vast library of movies and TV shows a portfolio spanning classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to contemporary hits such as Harry Potter and Friends, as well as the HBO and HBO Max streaming services. A Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson declined to comment. The winner will gain a significant advantage in the streaming wars by securing a vast content library that has long been a target for acquisition. Earlier this month, Netflix ultimately prevailed in its $27 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Warner Bros.' non-cable assets. Paramount CEO David Ellison subsequently made a direct, all-cash $30-per-share takeover bid to Warner Bros. shareholders. Paramount stated in filings submitted to regulators that its acquisition proposal is superior to Netflix's bid and more likely to secure regulatory approval. Paramount's acquisition plan consists of $41 billion in new equity backed by the Ellison family and Redbird Capital, along with $54 billion in debt financing commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo Global Management. According to Bloomberg, Affinity Partners, a firm owned by Jared Kushner and one of Paramount Pictures' financing partners, will withdraw from the competition. Paramount Pictures and Affinity Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.",

Discoverys board of directors may announce its decision on Paramount Sky Dances $ 108.4 billion acquisition offer as early as Wednesday according to people familiar with the matter . The board is expected to recommend shareholders vote against the bid . The renewed acceptance of Netflixs acquisition offer marks the latest development in this bidding war . The target of this contest includes Warner Bros. storied film and television studio along with its vast library of movies and TV shows a portfolio spanning classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to contemporary hits such as Harry Potter and Friends as well as the HBO and HBO Max streaming services . A Warner Bros . Discovery spokesperson declined to comment . The winner will gain a significant advantage in the streaming wars by securing a vast content library that has long been a target for acquisition . Earlier this month Netflix ultimately prevailed in its $ 27 billion cashandstock acquisition of Warner Bros. noncable assets . Paramount CEO David Ellison subsequently made a direct allcash $ 30pershare takeover bid to Warner Bros. shareholders . Paramount stated in filings submitted to regulators that its acquisition proposal is superior to Netflixs bid and more likely to secure regulatory approval . Paramounts acquisition plan consists of $ 41 billion in new equity backed by the Ellison family and Redbird Capital along with $ 54 billion in debt financing commitments from Bank of America Citigroup and Apollo Global Management . According to Bloomberg Affinity Partners a firm owned by Jared Kushner and one of Paramount Pictures financing partners will withdraw from the competition . Paramount Pictures and Affinity Partners did not_immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment ."

      "selftext": "Warner Bros. Discovery is preparing to advise its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance’s hostile takeover bid, with a formal recommendation expected as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount’s proposal valued Warner Bros. Discovery at roughly $108 billion in an all-cash offer, or about $30 per share, but board members have expressed concerns over the offer’s financing, structure and overall terms compared with other strategic options. The board appears inclined to recommend the company’s existing deal with Netflix which combines cash and stock and focuses on core studio and streaming assets as a more secure and valuable path forward for shareholders. The market has reacted to the escalating deal drama, with Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock weakening as news of the planned rejection circulated. Investors are watching closely as Paramount’s bid backed in part by funding from equity and debt partners faces internal resistance, and as other players like Netflix remain in contention. Also, Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners has reportedly exited the takeover battle, marking a shift in financing participation for the Paramount bid. Paramount still has time to revise or sweeten its offer before its tender deadline in early January, but Warner Bros. Discovery’s board seems poised to side with the alternative that they believe offers greater certainty and value for shareholders",

      "selftext_processed": "Warner Bros . Discovery is preparing to advise its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance ’ s hostile takeover bid with a formal recommendation expected as early as Wednesday according to people familiar with the matter . Paramount ’ s proposal valued Warner Bros . Discovery at roughly $ 108 billion in an allcash offer or about $ 30 per share but board members have expressed concerns over the offer ’ s financing structure and overall terms compared with other strategic options . The board appears inclined to recommend the company ’ s existing deal with Netflix which combines cash and stock and focuses on core studio and streaming assets as a more secure and valuable path forward for shareholders . The market has reacted to the escalating deal drama with Warner Bros. Discovery ’ s stock weakening as news of the planned rejection circulated . Investors are watching closely as Paramount ’ s bid backed in part by funding from equity and debt partners faces internal resistance and as other players like Netflix remain in contention . Also Jared Kushner ’ s Affinity Partners has reportedly exited the takeover battle marking a shift in financing participation for the Paramount bid . Paramount still has time to revise or sweeten its offer before its tender deadline in early January but Warner Bros. Discovery ’ s board seems poised to side with the alternative that they believe offers greater certainty and value for shareholders"

Next I chose some individual picks and tried to make it so that’s it’s not redundant with VOOG which was my biggest mistake on my last post, I know some of you guys will think adding NVDA and AMZN is redundant but these are two stocks I believe very highly in, I have some JPM, COST for steady growth and diversification, I believe in NFLX as I think they have some huge growth potential as they are starting to stream football and boxing, they also just did their acquisition of WB. Next I chose 10% btc because it is quite cheap right now and I believe it’s a good long term investment. Finally the 5% speculative is in nuclear, I have very high hopes for it. So overall what do you guys think, what is the weakest points and what should I change?",

Next I chose some individual picks and tried to make it so that ’ s it ’ s not_redundant with VOOG which was my biggest mistake on my last post I know some of you guys will think adding NVDA and AMZN is redundant but these are two stocks I believe very highly in I have some JPM COST for steady growth and diversification I believe in NFLX as I think they have some huge growth potential as they are starting to stream football and boxing they also just did their acquisition of WB . Next I chose 10 % btc because it is quite cheap right now and I believe it ’ s a good long term investment . Finally the 5 % speculative is in nuclear I have very high hopes for it . So overall what do you guys think what is the weakest points and what should I change"

      "selftext": "Before this post gets vamooshed for low effort posting, let me preface by saying I'm going to try my best not to make this the basic post the title suggests it is. I know there's a million threads about this. Statistically, unless you're retiring soon, putting everything into the market is better than trying to time it and holding cash, and waiting. That said, I am helping my father invest a sizeable amount of money in the market. He's always said that the markets are crazy overvalued, so he has kept his money invested in small local businesses. However, as he gets older, he wants to shift some funds into the market. Let's say he has a couple of million waiting to put into the market. Currently, it's sitting in SGOV. Would it be wise to start DCAing and holding cash for a crash, or should he allocate everything ASAP (into a broad market ETF)? Also, assume this would be money he could lose and still retire as he still has significant diversified local business equity. I know by asking this I'm contradicting what I said in the preface of this post, but for a while now, it's felt like another harsh correction is overdue. As a young investor myself, it's hard for me to piece together if things are really the same as always, or if anything is actually different this time. Especially with the current administration going guns blazing with economic and foreign policy. I'd love some more seasoned investors to share their input. On one side, P/E ratios suggest a bubble, but on the other hand, some say this is just the new kind of market we're living in. I don't expect a definitive answer (since I don't think anyone really knows), but I wanted to get some real people's opinions.",

      "selftext": "Tesla’s stock just set a new record, breaking past its previous all-time high from almost exactly a year ago. The rally comes after a wild 12 months for shareholders including a brutal 36% drop in Q1, the stock’s worst quarterly performance since 2022. What’s driving the rebound now seems to be renewed optimism around Tesla’s long-promised robotaxi vision. Investors appear to be betting that Tesla can finally convert its existing fleet of EVs into autonomous, revenue-generating vehicles, rather than treating autonomy as a distant concept. Still, it’s hard to ignore how quickly sentiment has flipped. From heavy losses early in the year to record highs now, Tesla remains one of the most emotion-driven names in the market. Do you see this move as confidence in real progress on autonomy, or just another sentiment-driven Tesla cycle? Source:",

      "selftext": "Nasdaq says it plans to file with the SEC to allow U.S. stocks and ETFs to trade almost around the clock, five days a week, starting as early as the second half of 2026. The proposal would stretch trading to 23 hours per weekday, splitting the market into a long “day session” (4 a.m.–8 p.m. ET), a one-hour pause, and an overnight session (9 p.m.–4 a.m.). Supporters argue this just formalizes what already exists in crypto and futures, and better serves global investors who don’t operate on U.S. time zones. Critics aren’t convinced. Concerns center on thinner liquidity during overnight hours, bigger price swings, and whether constant trading would amplify short-term speculation rather than improve price discovery. Curious how others see this. Is nearly nonstop equity trading the natural next step, or does it risk creating more volatility without real benefits for long-term investors? Source:",

      "selftext": "Basically we are all familiar with the sayings that the early bird gets the worm and the second mouse gets the cheese. I want to point that I am not entirely sure whether Tesla is fighting for a worm or cheese here. FSD will change the world but not in a way most people think. The gig work automation and the replacement of drivers etc is a solid argument but there is always more to it. FSD technology could pick your kids from school while you cook or your mother from the airport. FSD could drive your wife AND you to your jobs regardless of schedule conflicts. It could drop you at the city center and return home where parking is free. All these type of things will drastically change your life. This thing is kinda double edged though. The FSD technology albeit revolutionary is still a static technology that has no need to evolve it’s not like intel chips that were dominating for decades but today’s needs are better met with AMD. This technology will eventually kinda stop at level 5 or 6. Now let’s get to the main point. Either all heil Tesla the last standing car maker while everyone else goes bankrupt or we see FSD on every other car as well… I believe that the technology will eventually be copied and way faster than people expect. It could eventually become something like an AC. Think for example a truck that was built in the 1950s and a today’s and you ll realise that even if today trucks can haul double the load margins never doubled. This will be a catastrophe for automotive companies in a sense that it could drastically reduce the need for cars in families and peopl in general. The FSD software will also eventually become cheaper and cheaper and maybe even free. This is not a hypothetical scenario but a reality. My mouse has more complex software than a 70s computer and yet it doesnt cost anything nor it requires a subscription . The difference here again is that even if you can produce a 70s OS with chat gpt in a few minutes you need a more advanced version to execute today’s tasks but as I said this will be a static technology. So how do you take into account that even if it is a great technology due to not having a need to become more complex it will eventually be free and has no way to be monetised. I personally think the real benefit is the loyalty to the brand that pioneering innovation will bring but I am also afraid that the need for the real product is going to be drastically reduced as well. TLDR: FSD is a technology that will be eventually cheap bringing much less revenue than anticipated but will also drastically decrease the need for the underlying product",

      "selftext_processed": "Basically we are all familiar with the sayings that the early bird gets the worm and the second mouse gets the cheese . I want to point that I am not_entirely sure whether Tesla is fighting for a worm or cheese here . FSD will change the world but not_in a way most people think . The gig work automation and the replacement of drivers etc is a solid argument but there is always more to it . FSD technology could pick your kids from school while you cook or your mother from the airport . FSD could drive your wife AND you to your jobs regardless of schedule conflicts . It could drop you at the city center and return home where parking is free . All these type of things will drastically change your life . This thing is kinda double edged though . The FSD technology albeit revolutionary is still a static technology that has no_need to evolve it ’ s not_like intel chips that were dominating for decades but today ’ s needs are better met with AMD . This technology will eventually kinda stop at level 5 or 6 . Now let ’ s get to the main point . Either all heil Tesla the last standing car maker while everyone else goes bankrupt or we see FSD on every other car as well… I believe that the technology will eventually be copied and way faster than people expect . It could eventually become something like an AC . Think for example a truck that was built in the 1950s and a today ’ s and you ll realise that even if today trucks can haul double the load margins never_doubled . This will be a catastrophe for automotive companies in a sense that it could drastically reduce the need for cars in families and peopl in general . The FSD software will also eventually become cheaper and cheaper and maybe even free . This is not_a hypothetical scenario but a reality . My mouse has more complex software than a 70s computer and yet it doesnt cost anything nor it requires a subscription . The difference here again is that even if you can produce a 70s OS with chat gpt in a few minutes you need a more advanced version to execute today ’ s tasks but as I said this will be a static technology . So how do you take into account that even if it is a great technology due to not_having a need to become more complex it will eventually be free and has no_way to be monetised . I personally think the real benefit is the loyalty to the brand that pioneering innovation will bring but I am also afraid that the need for the real product is going to be drastically reduced as well . TLDR FSD is a technology that will be eventually cheap bringing much less revenue than anticipated but will also drastically decrease the need for the underlying product"

      "selftext": "# ETF Rebalance RGTI is facing a perfect storm this Friday, December 19th, with massive forced selling incoming. The $3.2B Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM) is rebalancing and must dump $30 million in RGTI shares and another $10 million in IONQ. This isn't speculation; it's a mechanical event. RGTI is also in other ETFs rebalancing the same day, meaning even more selling pressure is coming for a stock with a low float. Calculation: RGTI is part of other ETFs also the one's circled in red will be rebalanced on the 19-Dec and if the calculation is similar they will also sell RGTI is large quantities. Since most other ETFs are bond+stock type etfs with varied weighting we may see a slightly different outcome, but the point remains - RGTI has gone up over the quarter and unlike other companies it has a P/E that's negative EPS < 0 and stock price too high # Insider Selling continues While the ETFs are forced to sell, insiders have been voluntarily bailing for years. There have been **zero insider purchases since June 2022**. The latest sells were just days ago on December 10th. Most damning of all, **the CEO owns zero shares** in the company he runs. The people with all the information are showing zero confidence. Last sell was 7 days ago 9-Dec. This is happening to a company with laughable fundamentals. RGTI has a $10 billion market cap but generated less than $2 million in revenue last quarter. It's burning through $43.6 million in cash every 9 months, propped up by selling shares to retail investors. The valuation is a complete fantasy disconnected from reality. This Friday, a wave of forced selling is going to crash into a stock that insiders have already abandoned and that has no fundamental support. The correction is going to be brutal. **Position: +100 RGTZ. Total of 350 RGTZ.** NFA...obvi.",

      "selftext_processed": "ETF Rebalance RGTI is facing a perfect storm this Friday December 19th with massive forced selling incoming . The $ 3.2B Defiance Quantum ETF QTUM is rebalancing and must dump $ 30 million in RGTI shares and another $ 10 million in IONQ . This isnt speculation its a mechanical event . RGTI is also in other ETFs rebalancing the same day meaning even more selling pressure is coming for a stock with a low float . Calculation RGTI is part of other ETFs also the ones circled in red will be rebalanced on the 19Dec and if the calculation is similar they will also sell RGTI is large quantities . Since most other ETFs are bondstock type etfs with varied weighting we may see a slightly different outcome but the point remains RGTI has gone up over the quarter and unlike other companies it has a PE thats negative EPS 0 and stock price too high Insider Selling continues While the ETFs are forced to sell insiders have been voluntarily bailing for years . There have been zero insider purchases since June 2022 . The latest sells were just days ago on December 10th . Most damning of all the CEO owns zero shares in the company he runs . The people with all the information are showing zero confidence . Last sell was 7 days ago 9Dec . This is happening to a company with laughable fundamentals . RGTI has a $ 10 billion market cap but generated less than $ 2 million in revenue last quarter . Its burning through $ 43.6 million in cash every 9 months propped up by selling shares to retail investors . The valuation is a complete fantasy disconnected from reality . This Friday a wave of forced selling is going to crash into a stock that insiders have already abandoned and that has no_fundamental support . The correction is going to be brutal . Position 100 RGTZ . Total of 350 RGTZ . NFA ... obvi ."

      "selftext": "Forced Sellers vs. Optional Buyers - This Is the Core Problem The Carry Trader: A Forced Seller When the yen spikes-typically after a BoJ hike-carry traders are instantly underwater. They’re not selling U.S. equities by choice; they’re selling because margin calls leave them no alternative. These are forced liquidations. Cash is needed immediately, so they hit the bid at any price. The Domestic Buyer: Optional and Patient Yes, U.S. rate cuts are supportive for equities over time. But domestic investors are not compelled to buy today. Watching markets fall amid a carry unwind, their instinct is to wait: “Let’s see where the bottom is.” The result? A surge of “sell-at-any-price” orders and a vacuum of “buy-now” demand. Liquidity disappears, an air pocket forms, and prices freefall. The 10x Multiplier Effect Carry trades are rarely 1:1 with cash. They’re highly leveraged, often 5x–10x. Unwinding a $1B carry position can require dumping $5B–$10B in assets-often U.S. tech-to repay funding. By contrast, a domestic buyer stepping in after a 25 bp rate cut is typically buying cash, 1:1. The math is brutal: it can take ten domestic buyers to absorb the damage from one carry trader blowing up. The volume mismatch is extreme. Convergence Is What Kills the Trade Remember: the carry trade is pure arbitrage. It exists only because of a wide rate divergence between the U.S. and Japan. Wide gap: feels like free money-everyone piles in. Gap closing (convergence): the free money vanishes. Crucially, U.S. rate cuts don’t relieve the pressure-they intensify it. Returns are squeezed on the U.S. side while funding costs rise as the BoJ tightens. This isn’t a gentle “meeting in the middle”; it’s a pincer movement.",

Liquidity disappears an air pocket forms and prices freefall . The 10x Multiplier Effect Carry trades are rarely 11 with cash . They ’ re highly leveraged often 5x–10x . Unwinding a $ 1B carry position can require dumping $ 5B– $ 10B in assetsoften U.S. techto repay funding . By contrast a domestic buyer stepping in after a 25 bp rate cut is typically buying cash 11 . The math is brutal it can take ten domestic buyers to absorb the damage from one carry trader blowing up . The volume mismatch is extreme . Convergence Is What Kills the Trade Remember the carry trade is pure arbitrage . It exists only because of a wide rate divergence between the U.S. and Japan . Wide gap feels like free moneyeveryone piles in . Gap closing convergence the free money vanishes . Crucially U.S. rate cuts don ’ t relieve the pressurethey intensify it . Returns are squeezed on the U.S. side while funding costs rise as the BoJ tightens . This isn ’ t a gentle “ meeting in the middle ” it ’ s a pincer movement ."

      "title": "AVGO has fallen so sharply, but I see a massive rebound to $400! Stop looking at those junk AI stocks; AVGO is the real AI arms dealer!",
      "selftext": "Did AVGO's stock performance scare you? A perfectly good AI stock, and it dropped over 15% after the earnings report! Those analysts say it's because of profit margin dilution to hell with profit margins! This is panic selling, and it's a gift for those of us who dare to gamble. NVIDIA sells the shovels, but AVGO is the arms dealer that supplies parts to NVIDIA. It has secured the biggest clients: Google, Meta, and Microsoft are all frantically ordering custom chips and fiber optic connectors from AVGO. While the whole world is mining for AI, AVGO has a monopoly on selling the most expensive tools to the miners. It has a cash cow: Forget about those AI concept stocks, AVGO also has a large software business (VMware), which is like a money-printing machine. CEO Hock Tan, a ruthless operator, is implementing massive layoffs and price increases at VMware. He's not doing charity; he's aggressively squeezing out profits and using that money to buy back shares or pay out more dividends. In short: Bought at $340, the $400 target price is just the beginning. Now, I need your \"insider information.\" The only thing I'm unsure about is what big move this old fox, Hock Tan, is really planning. The market is saying that the layoffs after the VMware integration will be massive, and the internal situation is very chaotic. That's the key to truly unlocking massive profits. Does anyone work at AVGO or VMware? Tell me: how many people did your company actually lay off? Do those who were laid off have any juicy internal gossip to share? Did Hock Tan lay off employees to save money, or because of problems with the integration? A real insider scoop would help me feel more confident about my $400 bet! If you have any \"hot tips\" or \"inside information\" about the VMware restructuring, please leave a comment below. I'm not seeking any financial advice; I'm just a retail investor who wants to hear some inside stories and confirm whether my AVGO bet is sound.",

      "selftext": "Waymo quietly extended its lead in the robotaxi space in 2025 and is now operating, testing, or preparing launches across 26 markets in the U.S. and abroad. At this point, it’s the only player running large-scale, fully driverless commercial services in multiple cities, which gives it a meaningful real-world data advantage. Amazon’s Zoox is taking a different approach, starting with limited public access. It’s begun offering free driverless rides around parts of the Las Vegas Strip and select San Francisco neighborhoods, signaling confidence in its tech but still moving cautiously. Tesla has entered the conversation with a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the Bay Area, but as of mid-December those vehicles still rely on human drivers or safety supervisors. That puts Tesla more in a pilot phase than true autonomy for now. Overall, the gap between “driverless demos” and fully autonomous, scaled operations is becoming clearer. Waymo looks firmly in front today, while Zoox and Tesla are progressing just on very different timelines and risk profiles. Source:",

At this point it ’ s the only player running largescale fully driverless commercial services in multiple cities which gives it a meaningful realworld data advantage . Amazon ’ s Zoox is taking a different approach starting with limited public access . It ’ s begun offering free driverless rides around parts of the Las Vegas Strip and select San Francisco neighborhoods signaling confidence in its tech but still moving cautiously . Tesla has entered the conversation with a Robotaxibranded service in Austin and the Bay Area but as of midDecember those vehicles still rely on human drivers or safety supervisors . That puts Tesla more in a pilot phase than true autonomy for now . Overall the gap between “ driverless demos ” and fully autonomous scaled operations is becoming clearer . Waymo looks firmly in front today while Zoox and Tesla are progressing just on very different timelines and risk profiles . Source"

      "selftext": "Oracle has been sold off hard and in my view this is an oversold situation rather than a broken business. The stock has taken a sharp hit after earnings due to aggressive AI related capex and debt concerns, but the reaction looks excessive relative to what actually changed. First, I fully acknowledge the risk. Oracle is spending heavily. Data center buildout and AI infrastructure are expensive and the near term impact on free cash flow is real. That concern is valid and I am not ignoring it. Overspending is a legitimate risk and it deserves scrutiny. That said, risk does not automatically mean the stock is fairly priced at current levels. What I think the market is missing is Oracle’s positioning around enterprise data. Oracle databases sit under massive amounts of structured, regulated, and mission critical data across enterprises. As companies move toward building custom AI models on their own proprietary data, that data layer matters. You cannot train or fine tune serious enterprise models without clean, structured, governed data. Oracle already owns that layer for many companies. That gives them a real strategic position even if AI monetization takes time. Multiple market commentators have pointed out that the selloff appears sentiment driven rather than reflective of a collapse in the underlying business. Recent coverage on CNBC and Bloomberg has focused on debt and capex timing rather than any fundamental deterioration in Oracle’s core database or software demand. The concern is execution and cash flow timing, not relevance. From a technical standpoint, I entered in the 180s. That level previously acted as resistance in November 2024. Former resistance often becomes support once it is broken and revisited. We are now sitting around that same zone. If that level holds, it supports the idea that this move is an overshoot rather than the start of a long term breakdown. I am not married to the company or the CEO. I do not think Oracle is going to rip like Nvidia. I do think the market priced in worst case execution, persistent overspend, and credit stress all at once. That combination pushed the stock into oversold territory. This is not a blind bullish take. It is a view that risk is already well priced in and that Oracle’s data and database position still matters in an AI driven enterprise world. Open to pushback.",

      "selftext_processed": "Oracle has been sold off hard and in my view this is an oversold situation rather than a broken business . The stock has taken a sharp hit after earnings due to aggressive AI related capex and debt concerns but the reaction looks excessive relative to what actually changed . First I fully acknowledge the risk . Oracle is spending heavily . Data center buildout and AI infrastructure are expensive and the near term impact on free cash flow is real . That concern is valid and I am not_ignoring it . Overspending is a legitimate risk and it deserves scrutiny . That said risk does not_automatically mean the stock is fairly priced at current levels . What I think the market is missing is Oracle ’ s positioning around enterprise data . Oracle databases sit under massive amounts of structured regulated and mission critical data across enterprises . As companies move toward building custom AI models on their own proprietary data that data layer matters . You can not train or fine tune serious enterprise models without clean structured governed data . Oracle already owns that layer for many companies . That gives them a real strategic position even if AI monetization takes time . Multiple market commentators have pointed out that the selloff appears sentiment driven rather than reflective of a collapse in the underlying business . Recent coverage on CNBC and Bloomberg has focused on debt and capex timing rather than any fundamental deterioration in Oracle ’ s core database or software demand . The concern is execution and cash flow timing not_relevance . From a technical standpoint I entered in the 180s . That level previously acted as resistance in November 2024 . Former resistance often becomes support once it is broken and revisited . We are now sitting around that same zone . If that level holds it supports the idea that this move is an overshoot rather than the start of a long term breakdown . I am not_married to the company or the CEO . I do not_think Oracle is going to rip like Nvidia . I do think the market priced in worst case execution persistent overspend and credit stress all at once . That combination pushed the stock into oversold territory . This is not_a blind bullish take . It is a view that risk is already well priced in and that Oracle ’ s data and database position still matters in an AI driven enterprise world . Open to pushback ."

      "selftext": "Meta announced that it’s starting tests of an Instagram app designed specifically for TV screens in the U.S., launching first on Amazon’s Fire TV devices. The app will focus heavily on Reels, essentially bringing Instagram’s short-form video feed into a living-room format. According to Instagram VP of Product Tessa Lyons, this is just the first step. Meta plans to expand the TV app to other streaming platforms and device makers over time, depending on how users respond. It’s an interesting move considering how much time people already spend watching short-form video on phones. Meta seems to be testing whether that behavior translates to a lean-back experience similar to YouTube on TVs, and also whether Reels can compete for attention in a space traditionally dominated by longer content. Curious to see if this gains traction or if short-form video still ends up feeling better suited for mobile screens. Source:",

      "selftext": "Oil has been under steady pressure this year, and it doesn’t seem to be coming from just one factor. OPEC+ has been adding supply back into the market faster than many expected after years of disciplined output cuts, and that extra production is starting to show up in inventories and price action. At the same time, the geopolitical risk premium that supported crude over the past couple of years is slowly deflating. Markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a negotiated peace in Ukraine, or at least a less volatile outlook, which reduces fears around supply disruptions tied to the conflict. Put together, it’s a tough setup for oil bulls: more barrels coming online while the “fear bid” fades. Demand hasn’t collapsed, but it hasn’t been strong enough to absorb the new supply without pressure on prices. Curious how others are thinking about this is this just a cyclical oversupply phase, or does it mark a longer period of capped oil prices if geopolitics cool and OPEC+ prioritizes volume over price?

      "selftext": "Latest News Report: Meta has just launched a sound segmentation model called SAM Audio that splits audio tracks by sound source, separating vocals, instruments, and ambient sounds. If true, here are several noteworthy practical and investment points: Short term view: Impact on stock price may be limited. This appears more like incremental technological progress rather than a product poised to immediately drive significant revenue growth. Long term potential: Audio separation could directly serve advertising, creator tools, AR/VR, the metaverse, and content moderation. These are all areas where Meta seeks monetization or increased user engagement. Competitive landscape: If SAM Audio achieves high quality, low latency separation, Google, Adobe, and audio startups should be wary ecosystem integration matters. Who do you think will monetize sound separation technology most effectively: Meta, Google, Adobe, or smaller players? If you hold META stock, would this change your view on the company's long term strategy? Might you consider a small position increase?",

If true here are several noteworthy practical and investment points Short term view Impact on stock price may be limited . This appears more like incremental technological progress rather than a product poised to immediately drive significant revenue growth . Long term potential Audio separation could directly serve advertising creator tools ARVR the metaverse and content moderation . These are all areas where Meta seeks monetization or increased user engagement . Competitive landscape If SAM Audio achieves high quality low latency separation Google Adobe and audio startups should be wary ecosystem integration matters . Who do you think will monetize sound separation technology most effectively Meta Google Adobe or smaller players If you hold META stock would this change your view on the companys long term strategy Might you consider a small position increase"

      "selftext": "I'm taking JOYY as one of my cases, it has footprint on SEA and Middle East. They operate like a tech holding company,, consumer facing apps that can generate cash flow with solutions for business and also for the business future growth. JOYY balance sheet performance is solid. The balance sheet looks unusually strong compared to where the stock trades today.. This allows the management to return capital to their shareholders in an aggressive way through dividends and share buybacks. JOYY offers shareholders yield nearly 9%, which looks every attractive as Treasury yield are expected to fall when Fed rate cuts. the company is positioning itself into AdTech and SaaS segments. a forward PE 12.5x, it shows JOYY as a mature growth app company. The consumer apps still appear to fund the rest of the business for now. in Q3, live stream enhanced $399 mil in revenue.. Also the company is trying to reduce its reliance on single revenue stream. As we can see in the market nowadays, the livestream has been declined, but theirr solution is scaling rapidly. Advertising revenue up to more than 29% YoY. BIGO Ads generated $103.9 million in revenue, up to over 33% YoY. What I’m still trying to figure out is whether BIGO Ads can really become a meaningful external ad network over time. in 2026, JOYY plan to expand into IOS. The company focused on Android users before, which aligned very well with earlier market strategy. But now the management is shifting into a higher quality traffic. IOS expansion is a good strategy to have higher ARPU users in North America and Europe. In their Q3, ad requests from SDK networks increased by 230% YoY. At the same time, JOYY invested in AI driven ad. These capabilities improve advertiser ROI and help with high value clients in the long run. The AdTech market is expected to grow in the future. In parallel, JOYY is building its ecommerce SaaS business. Overall if their BIGO can maintain 20-25% growth rate, their revenue mix could look different in the next few years. If that happens, a re-rating makes sense on paper, but execution here matters a lot.",

They operate like a tech holding company consumer facing apps that can generate cash flow with solutions for business and also for the business future growth . JOYY balance sheet performance is solid . The balance sheet looks unusually strong compared to where the stock trades today .. This allows the management to return capital to their shareholders in an aggressive way through dividends and share buybacks . JOYY offers shareholders yield nearly 9 % which looks every attractive as Treasury yield are expected to fall when Fed rate cuts . the company is positioning itself into AdTech and SaaS segments . a forward PE 12.5x it shows JOYY as a mature growth app company . The consumer apps still appear to fund the rest of the business for now . in Q3 live stream enhanced $ 399 mil in revenue .. Also the company is trying to reduce its reliance on single revenue stream . As we can see in the market nowadays the livestream has been declined but theirr solution is scaling rapidly . Advertising revenue up to more than 29 % YoY . BIGO Ads generated $ 103.9 million in revenue up to over 33 % YoY . What I ’ m still trying to figure out is whether BIGO Ads can really become a meaningful external ad network over time . in 2026 JOYY plan to expand into IOS . The company focused on Android users before which aligned very well with earlier market strategy . But now the management is shifting into a higher quality traffic . IOS expansion is a good strategy to have higher ARPU users in North America and Europe . In their Q3 ad requests from SDK networks increased by 230 % YoY . At the same time JOYY invested in AI driven ad . These capabilities improve advertiser ROI and help with high value clients in the long run . The AdTech market is expected to grow in the future . In parallel JOYY is building its ecommerce SaaS business . Overall if their BIGO can maintain 2025 % growth rate their revenue mix could look different in the next few years . If that happens a rerating makes sense on paper but execution here matters a lot ."

      "selftext": "Nvidia had a pretty packed news cycle today, and taken together it helps explain why sentiment around the stock remains resilient despite all the macro and valuation noise. On the policy side, Nvidia reportedly received approval to sell advanced chips into China, albeit with the U.S. government taking a sizable cut of the revenue. While the margin impact matters, access to China at all especially for higher-end products is still meaningful given how important that market is for AI demand. It also signals that Nvidia continues to navigate export restrictions better than many expected. Investor confidence was also reinforced by reports that heavyweight investors like David Tepper and Dan Loeb increased their Nvidia positions. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but it does suggest that some very sophisticated money still sees upside or at least durable dominance ahead. From an execution standpoint, Nvidia’s acquisition of SchedMD strengthens its AI infrastructure and scheduling stack, which ties directly into CUDA and large-scale GPU deployments. Alongside that, the launch of new Nemotron AI models and partnerships to improve security on BlueField DPUs point to Nvidia continuing to push deeper into software and platform-level control, not just selling chips. Finally, Bank of America reiterated Nvidia as a top pick heading into 2026 with a $275 price target, framing the company as still central to global AI buildouts. Put together, it’s the same recurring theme: Nvidia isn’t standing still. Even with regulatory friction, high expectations, and crowded trades, the company keeps expanding its moat across hardware, software, and infrastructure. Whether that’s fully priced in or not is the real debate but the strategic momentum is hard to ignore.",

      "selftext": "Amazon announced two lower-profile partnerships: one with Mill Industries to reduce food waste at Whole Foods, and another with Slope to offer credit lines to sellers using Amazon’s internal data. Neither is flashy, but both reinforce how Amazon strengthens its ecosystem. Reducing waste improves margins and optics, while embedded financing makes third-party sellers more dependent on the platform. This feels less like experimentation and more like incremental moat-building. While AWS and AI dominate the headlines, these operational and financial tweaks are often what quietly move the needle over time for Amazon.",

Neither_is flashy but both reinforce how Amazon strengthens its ecosystem . Reducing waste improves margins and optics while embedded financing makes thirdparty sellers more dependent on the platform . This feels less like experimentation and more like incremental moatbuilding . While AWS and AI dominate the headlines these operational and financial tweaks are often what quietly move the needle over time for Amazon ."

      "selftext": "What stands out here is not one headline. It is repetition. Over the last stretch, Sunshine Biopharma has cleared three separate Health Canada approvals through its Canadian subsidiary. Domperidone was approved, followed by doxycycline, and then Pravastatin. For a microcap pharma, clearing even one approval can take years. Clearing three in sequence points to a system that works, not a lucky break. Each of these products is a standard prescription generic with established demand. That matters because approvals translate directly into sellable inventory and recurring revenue, not distant milestones. This builds on an existing base where the company is already generating more than 37M in annual revenue per recent filings, while the entire market cap sits around 6 to 7M. Despite that, SBFM still trades near the 1 dollar range. That pricing suggests the market is either ignoring the approvals or assuming they do not matter financially. Historically, chains of approvals tend to matter more than isolated wins because they signal execution. Do your own research.",

Over the last stretch Sunshine Biopharma has cleared three separate Health Canada approvals through its Canadian subsidiary . Domperidone was approved followed by doxycycline and then Pravastatin . For a microcap pharma clearing even one approval can take years . Clearing three in sequence points to a system that works not_a lucky break . Each of these products is a standard prescription generic with established demand . That matters because approvals translate directly into sellable inventory and recurring revenue not_distant milestones . This builds on an existing base where the company is already generating more than 37M in annual revenue per recent filings while the entire market cap sits around 6 to 7M . Despite that SBFM still trades near the 1 dollar range . That pricing suggests the market is either ignoring the approvals or assuming they do not_matter financially . Historically chains of approvals tend to matter more than isolated wins because they signal execution . Do your own research ."

      "selftext": "Hello, I have a question. This is the first year I was trying to tax loss harvest but ran into something confusing. From my understanding the basics of a wash sale is it is triggered if you sell a stock at a loss and then rebuy within 30 days or buy a stock and sell it within 30 days. Backstory I had like 200.076 shares all at a loss I am planning to offload this month, and have 2 covered calls at the strike price I want to sell it at (just to get some extra money). I sold the .076 shares to just have 200 shares today (was bugging me seeing that, also i have drip turned off now) but realized that may have messed up my tax loss plan. If my covered calls get assigned will I still be good at being able to use that loss to deduct or did I screw myself over? I may just be overthinking I just couldn’t find any posts about a similar scenario. When I googled it Google said “Selling a stock at a loss twice within a 30-day period triggers the wash-sale rule for the second loss, disallowing you from claiming that loss for tax purposes in the current year.” Does that mean my 200 share loss will be washed?….",

      "selftext": "Sometimes the setup is not about what has happened, but what could change the tape quickly. RIME trades with a relatively thin float, which makes volume spikes matter more than usual. When liquidity is limited, new attention or a single credible catalyst can move price faster than fundamentals alone would suggest. That is why the India angle keeps showing up on trader radars. Any confirmation tied to India, whether a pilot, partnership, or customer expansion, would not just be a fundamental update. It would be a visibility event. In small-cap names, visibility often drives the first move, analysis follows later. Right now, price action reflects hesitation and low engagement. That can persist, but it also means the stock is sensitive to changes in participation. Watching volume alongside news flow becomes more important than watching indicators in isolation. The key question is simple: if the next meaningful update is India-related, does the market react slowly, or does it rush to reprice exposure all at once? Do your own research.",

RIME trades with a relatively thin float which makes volume spikes matter more than usual . When liquidity is limited new attention or a single credible catalyst can move price faster than fundamentals alone would suggest . That is why the India angle keeps showing up on trader radars . Any confirmation tied to India whether a pilot partnership or customer expansion would not_just be a fundamental update . It would be a visibility event . In smallcap names visibility often drives the first move analysis follows later . Right now price action reflects hesitation and low engagement . That can persist but it also means the stock is sensitive to changes in participation . Watching volume alongside news flow becomes more important than watching indicators in isolation . The key question is simple if the next meaningful update is Indiarelated does the market react slowly or does it rush to reprice exposure all at once Do your own research ."

      "selftext": "Time is running out as the market digests a slew of major news. I've selected 4 stocks I believe warrant short-term attention and have potential for strong early-year performance, along with brief rationale and key risks: NVDA: H200 export approval to China (requiring U.S. revenue sharing) will create a near-term catalyst for sentiment and order fulfillment. Risks: Policy and compliance remain variable; valuation is already elevated. MSFT: Azure expansion in government and compliance markets (adding availability zones in Arizona), stable government contracts provide resilience against short-term volatility. Risks: Cloud competition and macro impacts on advertising and corporate IT budgets. ORCL: Heavily sold off post-earnings, but RPO and large contracts indicate robust long-term order volume. Significant upside potential if cash flow stabilizes. Risks: Surging CapEx, near-term free cash flow pressure. AMZN: Announced multi-billion dollar long-term investment in India. Successful execution could unlock next growth market. Risks: Long investment cycle, near-term margin pressure. My approach: Avoid chasing highs, build positions incrementally, and treat year-end as an observation window to assess order fulfillment and guidance delivery. Which stock do you think is most likely to deliver early gains next year? Would you increase positions now before year-end or wait until next year? This is for discussion only.

      "selftext": "There is a reflex reaction in small-cap trading where people hear the word biotech and immediately assume no revenue and constant dilution. That shortcut breaks down when you actually look at SBFM. Sunshine Biopharma currently carries a market cap around 6M, yet recent numbers point to more than 37M in annual revenue based on reported quarterly results and product sales. That alone separates it from the majority of Nasdaq biotechs in this range, many of which generate no commercial revenue at all. This revenue is coming from approved generic drugs sold through its Canadian subsidiary, not from speculative trial assets. The company has been expanding its product lineup, which suggests ongoing execution rather than a stalled pipeline. That does not remove risk, but it changes the conversation. When a stock trades as if the business does not exist, even basic awareness can shift sentiment. In low-float names, that shift does not require perfect fundamentals, only consistency and visibility.

I initiated a position buying 1,850 shares, mostly in the mid-$30s, when the stock price was implying worst-case scenarios. The original thesis was never about growth; it was about survivability and operational leverage. The volumes in crypto had cratered, there was a lot of regulatory risk, but Coinbase had a strong balance sheet, was rapidly cutting costs, and was the most well-regulated and friendly-way-of-entering-the-crypto-market in the U.S. Fast-forward to today, and it looks like a vastly different market. Prices and activity are strong, institutional participation has risen substantially, and the earnings power of Coinbase showed exactly what kind of operating leverage had fixed costs. It re-rated sharply from distressed prices. However, at current prices, rather than pricing survival, it’s pricing adoption and domination across the crypto space. Currently, trading commissions are generating most of the revenue, and this indicates a highly cyclical nature of the business despite improved subscription and service revenue. To be honest, I’m not as committed anymore. My gut is starting to lean toward exiting the trade rather than holding through another full cycle. The easy money was made when sentiment was broken; now it feels more like a risk vs reward decision. Anyyy counter arguments, facts or datapoints to change my mind...???",

MAGI is estimated at $135k this year and I’ve already maxed my Roth IRA & 401k (set myself up for backdoor Roth next year). I mention this as a W-2 employee with a side hustle income (I do tax withholding via W4 for my freelancing) Can someone help me understand how to estimate my taxes for the below if I sell now? Federal is fine. I don’t know if PA will tax as well. But just want to make sure I set enough $$ aside. And also….can I then use those funds towards my Roth IRA in 2026? Anyways…..should I do the above or just keep as is and eat it later? I know it’s not a lot of money but just good learning for me as I continue my investing journey and prep for 2026.",

      "selftext": "Yesterday, the S&P 500 rebounded after hitting 6801 for the second consecutive day, stubbornly holding above the key short term support level of 6800 we highlighted at the beginning of the month. However, the rebound was extremely weak. If the market can pull back to the pre market SPY level around 682 within the first half hour of trading, a rebound will likely follow. However, if the pullback fails to hold above this line and subsequently drops below the 679-677 range, the bears could unleash a fierce sell off. Ideally, the market should first test this range without breaking below it before rebounding, which would bolster bullish confidence. The decisive factor remains the performance of several major tech leaders, all of which have reached critical mid term support levels. Focus remains on: MSFT around 470 AMZN around 220 AAPL: A break below the 277 area would be negative, requiring a swift recovery. Intraday support is near 273. NVDA around 175: Needs to quickly return above 178. GOOGL: Entering its 16th trading day of correction. Intraday support is near 305. This is solely my personal view and strategy for reference only. Risk management is essential.",

      "selftext": "The November unemployment rate, delayed due to the government shutdown, rose to 4.6%, compared to the expected and previous reading of 4.4%. This marks a four year high. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 64K in November, exceeding the market forecast of 50K. The revised October figure showed a loss of 105K jobs, significantly worse than the previously reported gain of 108K in September. Following the data release, stock indices showed little change in pre market trading, continuing their previous pattern of high level consolidation. SPY retreated to the $679 area yesterday, with its intraday rebound failing to break above the $682 zone. The center of gravity is now shifting slightly downward. The intraday upside target remains the $682 area, while the downside test has shifted to around $677. Pre market individual stocks showed more declines than gains, with limited volatility and no prominent themes. Institutional investors are sharply divided on next year's market positioning: Goldman Sachs strongly recommends selling AI stocks and buying Value and large cycle sectors, while Morgan Stanley advises holding AI leaders. Retail investors, however, operate with modest capital small boats turn quickly, so no need for such complexity. Short term focus remains on whether major AI tech stocks can halt their decline swiftly. Roll over expiring hedges before Friday into contracts extending past the next earnings report. Most leading stocks are currently in a medium term consolidation phase, requiring time to restructure. Among other value sectors, automotive and machinery leaders have consistently shown strength, with TSLA and GM both hitting new yearly highs. Defense stocks have also outperformed the broader market in recent rebounds. Additionally, sectors like hotels and airlines within consumer goods, along with banks and select pharmaceutical leaders in finance, currently present more opportunities than AI tech. Choose your investment strategy based on your time horizon: sector rotation, ultra long term holding, or momentum trading as a short term trader whatever suits you best.

      "selftext": "Waymo grew its lead in the robotaxi market in 2025, and is now operating, planning to launch a service or testing its vehicles in 26 markets in the U.S. and abroad. Amazon’s Zoox began offering free driverless rides to the public around the Las Vegas Strip and certain San Francisco neighborhoods. Tesla launched a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area, but those cars still had human drivers or safety supervisors on board as of mid-December. Robotaxis felt like science fiction just a decade ago, but this year, autonomous vehicles became a commonplace option for paying passengers across big cities in the U.S. and parts of Asia. Alphabet-owned Waymo kept expanding and dominates the robotaxi market in the U.S., though rivals Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox also launched the first versions of their services in 2025. Meanwhile, Baidu-owned Apollo Go dominated in China. Some parents are now sending teens to schools and activities in Waymos, and women often praise the privacy of these AVs versus rides with strangers who drive for ride-hailing and traditional taxi services. Additionally, the company has begun testing vehicles in New York and Tokyo, two of the most dense cities in which Waymo has started driving. The company hasn’t yet specified service launch timelines for those markets. Waymo, in particular, has been so successful in its commercial expansion that Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged his rival’s achievements after previously criticizing the Google sister company. At Tesla’s annual meeting on Nov. 6, Musk thanked Waymo for “paving the path here” when it comes to working out the regulatory approvals that allow robotaxi services to do business across much of the U.S. In 2026, Waymo plans to open service in Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego and Washington, D.C. The company also announced plans to launch its service in London in 2026, which will mark Waymo’s first overseas service region. Waymo leads the 2025 robotaxi surge as Zoox expands and Tesla races to catch up",

      "selftext_processed": "Waymo grew its lead in the robotaxi market in 2025 and is now operating planning to launch a service or testing its vehicles in 26 markets in the U.S. and abroad . Amazon ’ s Zoox began offering free driverless rides to the public around the Las Vegas Strip and certain San Francisco neighborhoods . Tesla launched a Robotaxibranded service in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area but those cars still had human drivers or safety supervisors on board as of midDecember . Robotaxis felt like science fiction just a decade ago but this year autonomous vehicles became a commonplace option for paying passengers across big cities in the U.S. and parts of Asia . Alphabetowned Waymo kept expanding and dominates the robotaxi market in the U.S. though rivals Tesla and Amazonowned Zoox also launched the first versions of their services in 2025 . Meanwhile Baiduowned Apollo Go dominated in China . Some parents are now sending teens to schools and activities in Waymos and women often praise the privacy of these AVs versus rides with strangers who drive for ridehailing and traditional taxi services . Additionally the company has begun testing vehicles in New York and Tokyo two of the most dense cities in which Waymo has started driving . The company hasn ’ t yet specified service launch timelines for those markets . Waymo in particular has been so successful in its commercial expansion that Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged his rival ’ s achievements after previously criticizing the Google sister company . At Tesla ’ s annual meeting on Nov. 6 Musk thanked Waymo for “ paving the path here ” when it comes to working out the regulatory approvals that allow robotaxi services to do business across much of the U.S . In 2026 Waymo plans to open service in Dallas Denver Detroit Houston Las Vegas Miami Nashville Orlando San Antonio San Diego and Washington D.C . The company also announced plans to launch its service in London in 2026 which will mark Waymo ’ s first overseas service region . Waymo leads the 2025 robotaxi surge as Zoox expands and Tesla races to catch up"

I have a mid 700 credit score. I commonly see 3 similar investment methods that are recommended. 1. 100% VOO. Something about Jack Bogle saying US. stock are international because those companies operate internally. 2. VTI one and done. I believe 15% international exposure. 3. VOO and VXUS so you can rebalance if seen necessary. Far be it from me to believe I could determine a more optimized \"split\" than is offered in VTI. I'm fairly young. I can handle the volatility. I personally don't see the need to have bonds in my portfolio at the moment. Am I on the right track? Would you steer me towards one of these three options, or somewhere else entirely?

      "selftext": "Slope, an AI-powered lending platform backed by Sam Altman and JPMorgan Chase, announced a new partnership with Amazon’s independent sellers. Through the deal, sellers can apply for financing directly using Amazon’s internal sales and performance data, rather than going through traditional bank underwriting. According to Slope’s founders, the process is designed to be much faster and less paperwork-heavy than standard business loans, with decisions made using real-time data instead of credit committees. This could be especially useful for sellers looking to manage inventory, advertising spend, or seasonal cash flow gaps. It’s another example of how AI-driven fintech is moving closer to e-commerce platforms, blurring the line between marketplaces and financial services. The big question is how scalable this becomes and whether traditional banks can keep up with this kind of embedded lending model. Source:",

Through the deal sellers can apply for financing directly using Amazon ’ s internal sales and performance data rather than going through traditional bank underwriting . According to Slope ’ s founders the process is designed to be much faster and less paperworkheavy than standard business loans with decisions made using realtime data instead of credit committees . This could be especially useful for sellers looking to manage inventory advertising spend or seasonal cash flow gaps . It ’ s another example of how AIdriven fintech is moving closer to ecommerce platforms blurring the line between marketplaces and financial services . The big question is how scalable this becomes and whether traditional banks can keep up with this kind of embedded lending model . Source"

      "title": "WW International Inc. - Expected to benefit from the GLP-1 trend",
      "selftext": "Hi guys, I wanted to share my thoughts on WW International Inc. I wrote a detailed deep dive but I understand I'm not allowed to share it here. For refernce, I am a 22 year old fascinated with the world of investing, the niche I am trying to master are distressed / turnaround equties. I'm still relatively new to writing and valuation so I'd appreciate any advice from more seasonsed professionals. Shares currently trading at $24.28 per share, based on my valuation models I get a target price using conservative estimates of $35.52 per share and a price of $47.17 per share in a more bullish scenario. WW recently emerged from bankruptcy wiping out 70% of their debt from \\~$1.6 billion to a manageable \\~$466 million. Leverage based on $145 million adjusted EBITDA is 3.2x post-emergence to previously being at 11x. Their legacy behaviroul segment is in a decline, however their clinical segment is growing aggresively. They are currently trading at a EBITDA multiple of 3.8x, I feel like with the reduced leverage, high growth in the clinical segment, and cash generation, WW at least deserves a 6x multiple which would put the share price at $52.18 per share. They have ditched their offering for compounded sema and struck partnerships with both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which protects them from litigation risk. The GLP-1 shortage has ended which means that compounded sema is illegal. Novo Nordisk is currently suing these companies, and the FDA has issued warnings. Galloway Capital started building a position in WW in around 2024 (pre-bankruptcy) seeing the company as a deep value opportunity. Bruce Galloway said that WW still has solid fundamentals and does not meet the criteria for insolvency, making a bankruptcy filing both unwarranted and damaging to equity holders. Galloway believes that there was no exigency to WW’s bankruptcy filing, considering that the overwhelming majority of WW’s funded debt is not due until 2028 and 2029, and WW’s funded debt has favourable interest rates as compared to current market rates of interest. There is a pretty nice article from Yahoo Finance on this whole saga, check it out [here]( Get this, if Galloway was so confident about WW with a leverage ratio of 11x, what do you think WW has in store now with reduced debt and interest expenses. Additionally, in Bankruptcy law, there is an exemption under Section 1145 which allows companies emerging from Chapter 11 to issue new securities to creditors and existing shareholders without filing a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC. In 99% of distress-for-control deals, the lenders demand a Registration Rights Agreement (RRA) in the bankruptcy proceedings. I looked at all the relevant SEC and Chapter 11 fillings I could not find a RRA. Seems highly unusual for a lender group taking 91% control. It seems counterintuitive for powerful lenders to give up these rights. The potential reason I see is that the lenders might genuinely intend to hold the asset for a turnaround (1-2 years) rather than flipping it immediately (especially considering Galloway’s interest). There was a post on VIC on WW in June, when shares were trading at \\~$40, the writer's estimate was around \\~$65-$75 I would love to hear the communities thoughts on this and people can potentially point out things I would've missed or are incorrect. Thank you!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi guys I wanted to share my thoughts on WW International Inc . I wrote a detailed deep dive but I understand Im not_allowed to share it here . For refernce I am a 22 year old fascinated with the world of investing the niche I am trying to master are distressed turnaround equties . Im still relatively new to writing and valuation so Id appreciate any advice from more seasonsed professionals . Shares currently trading at $ 24.28 per share based on my valuation models I get a target price using conservative estimates of $ 35.52 per share and a price of $ 47.17 per share in a more bullish scenario . WW recently emerged from bankruptcy wiping out 70 % of their debt from $ 1.6 billion to a manageable $ 466 million . Leverage based on $ 145 million adjusted EBITDA is 3.2x postemergence to previously being at 11x . Their legacy behaviroul segment is in a decline however their clinical segment is growing aggresively . They are currently trading at a EBITDA multiple of 3.8x I feel like with the reduced leverage high growth in the clinical segment and cash generation WW at least deserves a 6x multiple which would put the share price at $ 52.18 per share . They have ditched their offering for compounded sema and struck partnerships with both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk which protects them from litigation risk . The GLP1 shortage has ended which means that compounded sema is illegal . Novo Nordisk is currently suing these companies and the FDA has issued warnings . Galloway Capital started building a position in WW in around 2024 prebankruptcy seeing the company as a deep value opportunity . Bruce Galloway said that WW still has solid fundamentals and does not_meet the criteria for insolvency making a bankruptcy filing both unwarranted and damaging to equity holders . Galloway believes that there was no_exigency to WW ’ s bankruptcy filing considering that the overwhelming majority of WW ’ s funded debt is not_due until 2028 and 2029 and WW ’ s funded debt has favourable interest rates as compared to current market rates of interest . There is a pretty nice article from Yahoo Finance on this whole saga check it out here Get this if Galloway was so confident about WW with a leverage ratio of 11x what do you think WW has in store now with reduced debt and interest expenses . Additionally in Bankruptcy law there is an exemption under Section 1145 which allows companies emerging from Chapter 11 to issue new securities to creditors and existing shareholders without filing a Form S1 registration statement with the SEC . In 99 % of distressforcontrol deals the lenders demand a Registration Rights Agreement RRA in the bankruptcy proceedings . I looked at all the relevant SEC and Chapter 11 fillings I could not_find a RRA . Seems highly unusual for a lender group taking 91 % control . It seems counterintuitive for powerful lenders to give up these rights . The potential reason I see is that the lenders might genuinely intend to hold the asset for a turnaround 12 years rather than flipping it immediately especially considering Galloway ’ s interest . There was a post on VIC on WW in June when shares were trading at $ 40 the writers estimate was around $ 65 $ 75 I would love to hear the communities thoughts on this and people can potentially point out things I wouldve missed or are incorrect . Thank you"

If we assume it is 30% of the entirety of Reality Labs, which I don’t believe. With expenses of \\~$16 billion, that would be over $4 billion in cuts. But remember, Meta is expected to have expenses in the range of $116-$118 billion in 2025, which will accelerate in 2026. $4 billion is not all that significant compared to the massive spend on AI. This metaverse cut is not that big of a deal. What is important is what it tells us about the AI spend and Metas’ willingness to cut it back if needed. Therefore, I see two likely outcomes for Meta. One, Mark Zuckerberg will reduce spend in the face of weak demand for AI, or two, AI will be a success and the high spend will continue. Doing a discounted cash flow valuation on both cases, I find Meta to be good value in either scenario. I get a weighted valuation of $950. Image: Reality Labs Revenue And Expenses I wasn't able to add images, you can search the same title for my Substack post to see them. Oh, I had to take out the reference links as Reddit was auto-blocking the post, I think. # Zuckerberg's Willingness To Change Mark Zuckerberg’s willingness to change should not have come as a massive surprise. There are multiple examples throughout Zuckerberg's career where he has shown this flexibility. In 2008, he embraced advertising, something he had long had doubts about, brought in Cheryl Sandberg, and gave up a lot of operational control when it was felt they needed an ‘Adult in the room’. Around 2010, Zuckerberg was all in on Facebook being a web-based platform without the need for a dedicated app. When that was proven wrong, they pivoted. Before long, they had one of the most popular apps in the world. And of course, more recently, they went all in on the metaverse, even changing the name of the company from Facebook to Meta in 2021. Then, in the 2022 Q4 report, they announced the ‘year of efficiency’. I see last week's reports of cuts in the metaverse as a continuation of this change of direction. It is this history that gives me, and I believe some of the market, faith that Zuckerberg can change direction if it becomes clear that the massive AI spend is not generating the desired returns. # Two Scenarios To help me value the company, I found it useful to think of two scenarios and do separate valuations for each of them. Scenario 1, AI returns do not appear, and cuts in CapEx are needed. Scenario 2, AI leads to increased revenue. **Scenario 1: Cuts to AI spend** Meta has been quite clear that AI has given tangible benefits to their underlying business. Most analysts expect over 15% growth in the next 12 months. In this scenario, I'm going to assume it ends there. Algorithms are as optimised as they can get, there are no more efficiencies to find, and no new AI revenue sources appear. Image: DCF Model For Scenario 1: Reduced CapEx I am modelling revenue falling back to a still respectable 8%, which will then trail off to a terminal growth rate of 5%. This may seem high given a failed AI pivot, but keep in mind the underlying business is still dominant in the world of social media. Ad spend is still migrating to online, the world, especially outside the US, is getting richer, and there is no reason to think that Meta will not continue to grow for the foreseeable future. As we discussed in his history, I believe Zuckerberg will pivot in the face of an AI failure and reduce Capex and spend. Barring any writedown, this will likely take a number of years as depreciation works its way through the books. I am modelling EBIT margin to rise from the current \\~40% to a terminal margin of 49%. And for the terminal reinvestment, I'm assuming a return on invested capital of 20%. Image: Final DCF Calculations Putting all these numbers together. I get a valuation of $861. So even in the scenario of a failed AI buildout, there is a case for Meta to be good value. With that said, it is easy to see the stock selling off in that situation, which could allow for an even more attractive entry. # Scenario 2: AI is moderately successful AI succeeding is such a general statement that it is very difficult to model. I will assume their revenues remain higher for longer as they continue to reap the rewards of AI, both in their core business and in any new business models that come from AI. I am modelling them to have 20% growth, trailing off to 15% in 4 years, and then trailing off to a terminal growth rate of 5.5%. Image: DCF Model For Scenario 2: AI Moderate Success To support this growth, I am continuing the high CapEx spend, but with that said, I am assuming that the costs are front-loaded and relative to revenue, CapEx will actually fail. I am modelling this as EBIT margins remaining fairly steady, with a terminal rate of 37%. For the terminal reinvestment, I am assuming a return on invested capital of 15%. Image: Final DCF Calculations Adding all that up gets me to a valuation of $1,115. Of course, there is plenty of room in this 'AI moderate success' scenario for more upside. I see this as a conservative valuation. # Combining The Models When I do more than one valuation model, I like to get a weighted average between them, which means we have to give each scenario a likelihood. While I believe AI will be transformational, I'm not convinced Meta will be the one to build it. For that reason, I'm putting ‘reduced CapEx’ as the slightly more likely scenario and giving it a 65% weighting. When it comes to AI, if a company wants to be successful, it will need piles of money, abundant sources of data, and a willingness to go for it. Zuckerberg and Meta have all of that. I am putting a weighting of 35% on the ‘AI moderately successful’ scenario. Image: Weighted Average Calculation AI will succeed or fail. It is black or white, but I do like to work in the grey middle, so for my overall valuation, I will be using this weighted average of $950. Given the different potential outcomes, it will be important to regularly update this model and my $950 valuation. For now, I am confident in placing a BUY target on the stock. # Risks Zuckerberg has full control over Meta with his super-voting rights. And while in the past he's shown a willingness to change direction. A shareholder still has to accept that they are at the whims of one person. If he digs his heels in and says he will succeed in AI or take Meta down with him, there is not much we can do As with any international company, there will be regulation and antitrust risk. From European Union fines to the Austrailian under 16 ban, there is a constant risk on this front. If AI is as disruptive as many think it will be, there is no valuation model, no company, and perhaps no industry that is safe. # Conclusion Meta giving up on the metaverse is not the real story here. The real story is that once again, Mark Zuckerberg has shown a willingness to change direction when needed. The market sees that willingness to change direction as a safety net. If AI succeeds, great, shareholders will reap the rewards. If it fails, Zuckerberg will cut his losses, rightsize the company, and continue to run the world's largest social media empire. \\---------------------------------------- Check out my Substack for more valuations like this.",

      "selftext_processed": "Introduction The reported cuts to the Reality Labs ’ budget have likely been overstated . First it is unclear how big the cuts are and which part of Reality Labs they affect . Will it just be VR and the Metaverse or will augmented reality smart glasses be included Reports are of 10 % and 30 % cuts . Again how will this be spread out If we assume it is 30 % of the entirety of Reality Labs which I don ’ t believe . With expenses of $ 16 billion that would be over $ 4 billion in cuts . But remember Meta is expected to have expenses in the range of $ 116 $ 118 billion in 2025 which will accelerate in 2026 . $ 4 billion is not_all that significant compared to the massive spend on AI . This metaverse cut is not_that big of a deal . What is important is what it tells us about the AI spend and Metas ’ willingness to cut it back if needed . Therefore I see two likely outcomes for Meta . One Mark Zuckerberg will reduce spend in the face of weak demand for AI or two AI will be a success and the high spend will continue . Doing a discounted cash flow valuation on both cases I find Meta to be good value in either scenario . I get a weighted valuation of $ 950 . Image Reality Labs Revenue And Expenses I wasnt able to add images you can search the same title for my Substack post to see them . Oh I had to take out the reference links as Reddit was autoblocking the post I think . Zuckerbergs Willingness To Change Mark Zuckerberg ’ s willingness to change should not_have come as a massive surprise . There are multiple examples throughout Zuckerbergs career where he has shown this flexibility . In 2008 he embraced advertising something he had long had doubts about brought in Cheryl Sandberg and gave up a lot of operational control when it was felt they needed an ‘ Adult in the room ’ . Around 2010 Zuckerberg was all in on Facebook being a webbased platform without the need for a dedicated app . When that was proven wrong they pivoted . Before long they had one of the most popular apps in the world . And of course more recently they went all in on the metaverse even changing the name of the company from Facebook to Meta in 2021 . Then in the 2022 Q4 report they announced the ‘ year of efficiency ’ . I see last weeks reports of cuts in the metaverse as a continuation of this change of direction . It is this history that gives me and I believe some of the market faith that Zuckerberg can change direction if it becomes clear that the massive AI spend is not_generating the desired returns . Two Scenarios To help me value the company I found it useful to think of two scenarios and do separate valuations for each of them . Scenario 1 AI returns do not_appear and cuts in CapEx are needed . Scenario 2 AI leads to increased revenue . Scenario 1 Cuts to AI spend Meta has been quite clear that AI has given tangible benefits to their underlying business . Most analysts expect over 15 % growth in the next 12 months . In this scenario Im going to assume it ends there . Algorithms are as optimised as they can get there are no_more efficiencies to find and no_new AI revenue sources appear . Image DCF Model For Scenario 1 Reduced CapEx I am modelling revenue falling back to a still respectable 8 % which will then trail off to a terminal growth rate of 5 % . This may seem high given a failed AI pivot but keep in mind the underlying business is still dominant in the world of social media . Ad spend is still migrating to online the world especially outside the US is getting richer and there is no_reason to think that Meta will not_continue to grow for the foreseeable future . As we discussed in his history I believe Zuckerberg will pivot in the face of an AI failure and reduce Capex and spend . Barring any writedown this will likely take a number of years as depreciation works its way through the books . I am modelling EBIT margin to rise from the current 40 % to a terminal margin of 49 % . And for the terminal reinvestment Im assuming a return on invested capital of 20 % . Image Final DCF Calculations Putting all these numbers together . I get a valuation of $ 861 . So even in the scenario of a failed AI buildout there is a case for Meta to be good value . With that said it is easy to see the stock selling off in that situation which could allow for an even more attractive entry . Scenario 2 AI is moderately successful AI succeeding is such a general statement that it is very difficult to model . I will assume their revenues remain higher for longer as they continue to reap the rewards of AI both in their core business and in any new business models that come from AI . I am modelling them to have 20 % growth trailing off to 15 % in 4 years and then trailing off to a terminal growth rate of 5.5 % . Image DCF Model For Scenario 2 AI Moderate Success To support this growth I am continuing the high CapEx spend but with that said I am assuming that the costs are frontloaded and relative to revenue CapEx will actually fail . I am modelling this as EBIT margins remaining fairly steady with a terminal rate of 37 % . For the terminal reinvestment I am assuming a return on invested capital of 15 % . Image Final DCF Calculations Adding all that up gets me to a valuation of $ 1115 . Of course there is plenty of room in this AI moderate success scenario for more upside . I see this as a conservative valuation . Combining The Models When I do more than one valuation model I like to get a weighted average between them which means we have to give each scenario a likelihood . While I believe AI will be transformational Im not_convinced Meta will be the one to build it . For that reason Im putting ‘ reduced CapEx ’ as the slightly more likely scenario and giving it a 65 % weighting . When it comes to AI if a company wants to be successful it will need piles of money abundant sources of data and a willingness to go for it . Zuckerberg and Meta have all of that . I am putting a weighting of 35 % on the ‘ AI moderately successful ’ scenario . Image Weighted Average Calculation AI will succeed or fail . It is black or white but I do like to work in the grey middle so for my overall valuation I will be using this weighted average of $ 950 . Given the different potential outcomes it will be important to regularly update this model and my $ 950 valuation . For now I am confident in placing a BUY target on the stock . Risks Zuckerberg has full control over Meta with his supervoting rights . And while in the past hes shown a willingness to change direction . A shareholder still has to accept that they are at the whims of one person . If he digs his heels in and says he will succeed in AI or take Meta down with him there is not_much we can do As with any international company there will be regulation and antitrust risk . From European Union fines to the Austrailian under 16 ban there is a constant risk on this front . If AI is as disruptive as many think it will be there is no_valuation model no_company and perhaps no_industry that is safe . Conclusion Meta giving up on the metaverse is not_the real story here . The real story is that once again Mark Zuckerberg has shown a willingness to change direction when needed . The market sees that willingness to change direction as a safety net . If AI succeeds great shareholders will reap the rewards . If it fails Zuckerberg will cut his losses rightsize the company and continue to run the worlds largest social media empire .

This opening of potash would depreciate the price which would impact Nutrien's bottomline. However, Belarus is a landlocked country so just because the US lifted the sanctions, the European sanctions are still there which means they still can't get to international markets. So here's two conflicting forces at play for the potash market. What is everyone's thoughts on Nutrien going into 2026?",

My question: is this an inherently good or bad decision? I know it’s more theoretical since the future market is all speculative, but I’ve read that at my age (27), the growth potential of the “base” stocks I’m pursuing significantly outweights ETFs & the time to recover from a significant drawdown (40% - 50%) would actually be quicker by relocating funds.",

      "selftext": "1. Forced Sellers vs. Optional Buyers This is the main issue * The Carry Trader: When the Yen spikes (because the BoJ hiked), these guys are underwater immediately. They aren’t selling U.S. stocks because they *want* to; they are selling because they are getting margin called. They are forced sellers. They need cash T-minus now. They hit the bid, regardless of the price. * The Domestic Buyer: Sure, U.S. rate cuts look good for stocks. But if you're a domestic investor, you aren't forced to buy *today*. You see the market tanking from the carry unwind and you think, \"I'll wait for the bottom.\" So you have a flood of \"sell at any price\" orders and a total lack of \"buy right now\" orders. That creates an air pocket, and prices freefall. 2. The 10x Multiplier Carry trades are almost never 1:1 with cash. They are highly leveraged, often 5x or 10x. If a fund unwinds a $1B carry trade, they might have to dump $5B to $10B worth of assets (like U.S. Tech stocks) to pay back the loan. A domestic buyer entering the market because of a 0.25% rate cut is likely buying with cash (1:1). Math: It takes 10 domestic buyers to absorb the damage of 1 carry trader blowing up. The volume mismatch is insane. 3. Convergence kills the trade You have to remember that the Carry Trade is purely an arbitrage play. It only exists because there is a massive gap (divergence) between U.S. and JP rates. * Wide Gap: Free money. Everyone piles in. * Gap Closing (Convergence): The free money is gone. The U.S. cutting rates actually accelerates the pain for the carry trader. It shrinks their profit margin from the U.S. side while the BoJ crushes them on the cost side. It’s not a \"meeting in the middle,\" it’s a pincer movement. TL;DR: Domestic buyers are walking into the store looking for bargains. Carry traders are running out of the store because the building is on fire. One group is much faster and more violent than the other.",

      "title": "The November ADP Jobs report is worse than you think, and a sign of what's to come",
      "selftext": "Plenty of articles have came out reporting on the 32,000 reduction in US private employment that ADP reported. This seems bad, but the reality is far worse. If you look at the employment changes by employer size, employers with less than 50 workers employ 120,000 less in November, whereas employers with >=50 workers 90,000 more, nearly cancelling out the losses from smaller employers. The reason this is notable is because smaller employers are faster to respond to changes in business conditions than larger ones, for a number of reasons: - Large businesses are generally more bureaucratic and involve annual budgets, so it can take time for layoffs to occur in response to slowing demand, whereas a small business with <50 employees don't have a long chain of management that makes layoffs a long process. - Large businesses are required to issue advance notice of mass layoffs via WARN. Businesses with <100 employees are exempt. This further delays large businesses seeking to downsize even after they finalize a plan. - Small businesses have less access to capital and higher borrowing costs to be able to ride out short to mid term impacts to cash flow, making layoffs necessary to manage cash flows when revenue falls. Larger companies have access to revolving credit facilities at low interest rates which addresses short term cash flows challenges. As a result of all this, small businesses are actually a really strong leading indicator of where the labor market will go. Large businesses, while slower to react to business conditions, are historically even more cyclical than small businesses. So we are likely to see a reduction in employment at mid to large private sector firms in the near future. Position: Lots of VGLT to bet on rate cuts and QE pushing up bond prices/yields down. Might be premature(I have no idea what numbers will show tomorrow), but I think the labor market is going to slow further in the coming year.",

      "title": "Cigs Are Good For You: Why Oral Turns Me on!",
      "selftext": "TLDR: Altria is a deep value buy. The US cig ecosystem is fundamentally misunderstood. The market doesn't see pouches as a growth vector for companies other than PMI and discounts the future attrition of customers (largely young, non smokers) from pouches to cigs that will inevitably result. If On!’s growth follows historical and grows near 60% CAGR it will account for more than 75% of the company's oral volume and drive the segment to generate more than 20% of Altria’s total revenue in 2029 (versus a negligible 3% total total volume in 2024). Altria bought Helix, which makes on!, for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on! did around 500M in revenue. The market has overlooked on! as a growth driver because its baked into the oral segment in Altria's earning reports, guidance, and financials, but it doesn't behave like an oral segment product -> its not chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not cigs. Once it grows to a point of financial significance in Altria's portfolio the market is going to **re-rate** the stock. [DCF]( Altria Group (MO) has a significant moat in the US cig market (45.8% of US Cigarette Market, 59.3% of US Premium Cigarette Market, 37.5% of US Smokeless Tobacco Market), but the problem is US cig sales have been declining YoY seemingly forever. And Altria's revenues reflect this to even more drastic extent. Cigs' share of nicotine market fell to a low of 60% in 2024 down from 90% in 2000. Broad industry growth is now driven exclusively by emerging markets (Altria operates only in the US in which \\~19% of Americans 15 or older currently use tobacco products vs \\~25% of Europeans 15 or olders). Altria's US cig moat and lack of apparent growth driver (they sold IQOS system to PMI -> IQOS is the future of vapes) is starting to be viewed by the market as a liability and as a result its trading at an extreme discount to peers. But Altria does have a growth driver, on! Altria bought Helix, which makes on!, for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on! did around 500M in revenue. US Pouch Market grew at an average annual rate of 50% 2020-2024. on! currently outpaces the growth of the US Pouches Market over the last 5 years growing at an average annual rate of 70%. Industry estimates project a US Nicotine Pouches Market CAGR of 28%-50% through 2034 ($250B+ Market). on! trails behind Zyn but still controls 30% market share in a near duopolistic environment. The market (and even Altria itself) is completely ignoring on! because as its stands now it is a inconsequential revenue or growth driver in Altria's portfolio. on!’s numbers are buried in Altria’s financials and earnings reports, combined with chewing tobacco as the total oral segment instead of a standalone “pouches” segment; on! doesn't behave like an oral segment product -> its not chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not cigs. In 2024 on! was only 20% of Altria’s oral units sold and accounted for only 2.4% of revenue. If on!’s historical growth rate of 60% continues through 2029 on! will be 75% of Altria’s oral volume and 25% of total revenue. on!’s trajectory positions it as a core earnings growth driver not yet rated by the market. The problem is that this DD implies a buy and hold and then wait for the market to catch up and rerate the stock, hoping all the while that the bleeding stops. Except not really. You're more than compensated for your time here. Altria maintains disciplined share repurchases and a stable dividend policy (78.6% Payout). The company has committed up to $2 billion in share repurchasing by the end of 2026, $1.3 billion remaining authorized. So here we get both buybacks and divs in a consumer staple that trades at a discount to peers in a macro environment with fearful sensibilities. And despite falling revenues, margins continue to grow with no sight of slowing down. Altria is largely insulated from tariffs given their domestic business model, and as pouches scale, margins will widen there as well. In fact, the more we look at revenues broadly, the more it looks over played. Not only do they grow margins at every mark, if we excise tax is taken out from COGS, it shows that Altria has cut cost at every corner. + if we read revenues net of excise tax it actually shows revenue growth But the thing that is most compelling here is that the US tobacco market is just fundamentally misunderstood. The market sees this well observed declining trend (declining consumption of tobacco products) and views it as baked in and linear. They think the future generations wont smoke and that cig is a staple of a dying breed. But this is not the case. It is a highly addictive drug that will continue to grow. The bottom of the sentiment is in. Joe rogan says cigs are good for you. Dr Huberman says cigs are good for you. Cigs are a nootropic that stimulate the mind and actually make you smarter and better looking and better at life. The evil tobacco barons of old couldn't have devised a better psyop to get people to smoke. The product is being authentically re-marketed to younger generations. & pouches growth is a manifestation of this. Pouches are not eating into cig sales in adding more speed to a declining trend, instead the decline is stable and the pouch growth is exponential. This implies significant customer acquisition to newer, non smoking, younger consumers. The research on this is highly contested as pouch research is new, but as these customers are acquired there will be some natural attrition to cigs. Some % (like 1 in 5) of non smoking pouch consumers will ultimately become cig consumers, and in the US Altria controls 50% of the cig market, so that moat that the market views more and more as a liability, will only prove to be more and more of an asset in the coming years. Regardless, the cigs are good for you psyop at the very least signal a bottoming out in the declining tobacco sentiment in the US, indicating the declining trend is a lot less sticky than the market has priced. I did a DCF which I've linked above which gave an intrinsic value of $78 with a MOS of 35%. I then did a sensitivity table under different conditions (bull v bear, see assumptions in the DCF but the primary are revenue broadly and revenue in on!). The DCF only affirmed the thesis. The bull case was achieved with declining revenues in each of Altria’s product lines except on! fck it i just posted one of the DCFs (base case) cuz idk if the links are gunna work so sorry about that but there you go. Basically the DD shows **BUY** & hold Altria (MO) for 5 Years or until market re-rates the stock as on! becomes a noticeable earnings growth driver and pouch industry customer acquisition growth results in customer attrition back to Altria’s US cigarette moat.

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Altria is a deep value buy . The US cig ecosystem is fundamentally misunderstood . The market doesnt see pouches as a growth vector for companies other than PMI and discounts the future attrition of customers largely young non smokers from pouches to cigs that will inevitably result . If On ’ s growth follows historical and grows near 60 % CAGR it will account for more than 75 % of the companys oral volume and drive the segment to generate more than 20 % of Altria ’ s total revenue in 2029 versus a negligible 3 % total total volume in 2024 . Altria bought Helix which makes on for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on did around 500M in revenue . The market has overlooked on as a growth driver because its baked into the oral segment in Altrias earning reports guidance and financials but it doesnt behave like an oral segment product its not_chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not_cigs . Once it grows to a point of financial significance in Altrias portfolio the market is going to rerate the stock . DCF Altria Group MO has a significant moat in the US cig market 45.8 % of US Cigarette Market 59.3 % of US Premium Cigarette Market 37.5 % of US Smokeless Tobacco Market but the problem is US cig sales have been declining YoY seemingly forever . And Altrias revenues reflect this to even more drastic extent . Cigs share of nicotine market fell to a low of 60 % in 2024 down from 90 % in 2000 . Broad industry growth is now driven exclusively by emerging markets Altria operates only in the US in which 19 % of Americans 15 or older currently use tobacco products vs 25 % of Europeans 15 or olders . Altrias US cig moat and lack of apparent growth driver they sold IQOS system to PMI IQOS is the future of vapes is starting to be viewed by the market as a liability and as a result its trading at an extreme discount to peers . But Altria does have a growth driver on Altria bought Helix which makes on for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on did around 500M in revenue . US Pouch Market grew at an average annual rate of 50 % 20202024. on currently outpaces the growth of the US Pouches Market over the last 5 years growing at an average annual rate of 70 % . Industry estimates project a US Nicotine Pouches Market CAGR of 28 % 50 % through 2034 $ 250B Market . on trails behind Zyn but still controls 30 % market share in a near duopolistic environment . The market and even Altria itself is completely ignoring on because as its stands now it is a inconsequential revenue or growth driver in Altrias portfolio . on ’ s numbers are buried in Altria ’ s financials and earnings reports combined with chewing tobacco as the total oral segment instead of a standalone “ pouches ” segment on doesnt behave like an oral segment product its not_chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not_cigs . In 2024 on was only 20 % of Altria ’ s oral units sold and accounted for only 2.4 % of revenue . If on ’ s historical growth rate of 60 % continues through 2029 on will be 75 % of Altria ’ s oral volume and 25 % of total revenue . on ’ s trajectory positions it as a core earnings growth driver not_yet rated by the market . The problem is that this DD implies a buy and hold and then wait for the market to catch up and rerate the stock hoping all the while that the bleeding stops . Except not_really . Youre more than compensated for your time here . Altria maintains disciplined share repurchases and a stable dividend policy 78.6 % Payout . The company has committed up to $ 2 billion in share repurchasing by the end of 2026 $ 1.3 billion remaining authorized . So here we get both buybacks and divs in a consumer staple that trades at a discount to peers in a macro environment with fearful sensibilities . And despite falling revenues margins continue to grow with no_sight of slowing down . Altria is largely insulated from tariffs given their domestic business model and as pouches scale margins will widen there as well . In fact the more we look at revenues broadly the more it looks over played . Not_only do they grow margins at every mark if we excise tax is taken out from COGS it shows that Altria has cut cost at every corner . if we read revenues net of excise tax it actually shows revenue growth But the thing that is most compelling here is that the US tobacco market is just fundamentally misunderstood . The market sees this well observed declining trend declining consumption of tobacco products and views it as baked in and linear . They think the future generations wont smoke and that cig is a staple of a dying breed . But this is not_the case . It is a highly addictive drug that will continue to grow . The bottom of the sentiment is in . Joe rogan says cigs are good for you . Dr Huberman says cigs are good for you . Cigs are a nootropic that stimulate the mind and actually make you smarter and better looking and better at life . The evil tobacco barons of old couldnt have devised a better psyop to get people to smoke . The product is being authentically remarketed to younger generations . pouches growth is a manifestation of this . Pouches are not_eating into cig sales in adding more speed to a declining trend instead the decline is stable and the pouch growth is exponential . This implies significant customer acquisition to newer non smoking younger consumers . The research on this is highly contested as pouch research is new but as these customers are acquired there will be some natural attrition to cigs . Some % like 1 in 5 of non smoking pouch consumers will ultimately become cig consumers and in the US Altria controls 50 % of the cig market so that moat that the market views more and more as a liability will only prove to be more and more of an asset in the coming years . Regardless the cigs are good for you psyop at the very least signal a bottoming out in the declining tobacco sentiment in the US indicating the declining trend is a lot less sticky than the market has priced . I did a DCF which Ive linked above which gave an intrinsic value of $ 78 with a MOS of 35 % . I then did a sensitivity table under different conditions bull v bear see assumptions in the DCF but the primary are revenue broadly and revenue in on . The DCF only affirmed the thesis . The bull case was achieved with declining revenues in each of Altria ’ s product lines except on fck it i just posted one of the DCFs base case cuz idk if the links are gunna work so sorry about that but there you go . Basically the DD shows BUY hold Altria MO for 5 Years or until market rerates the stock as on becomes a noticeable earnings growth driver and pouch industry customer acquisition growth results in customer attrition back to Altria ’ s US cigarette moat .

      "title": "Ford Takes $19.5 Billion Hit in Detroit’s Biggest EV Bust - Automaker is shifting to hybrid gas-and-electric vehicles",
      "selftext": "Ford Motor said Monday it expected to take about $19.5 billion in charges, mainly tied to its electric-vehicle business, a massive hit as the automaker retrenches in the face of sinking EV demand. The sum is among the largest impairments taken by a company and marks the U.S. auto industry’s biggest reckoning to date that it can’t realize its electric-vehicle ambitions anytime soon. Ford, which has lost $13 billion on its EV business since 2023, said it would bolster its lineup of gas-powered vehicles while shifting to hybrid and so-called extended-range electric vehicles that include onboard gasoline engines. The goal is to pull back from loss-making assets and redeploy capital designated for EVs to models with higher profitability. “Instead of plowing billions into the future knowing these large EVs will never make money, we are pivoting,” Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said in an interview. “We now know enough about the U.S. market where we have a lot more certainty in this second inning” of reduced-emissions powertrains, he said. Regulatory changes and lackluster demand from Americans are forcing U.S. automakers to abandon plans to quickly step to an electric-vehicle future. Ford, which had bet big on EVs, is now making one of the industry’s biggest changes to its business. The company said it remains on track to produce a $30,000 EV pickup for sale by 2027, which the company says will be the first in a new string of low-cost EVs. “Now this is the core of our EV strategy in America,” Farley said. “We’ve got to land the plane.” The company will stop making an EV version of its F-150 pickup truck, called the Lightning, and will instead make an extended-range version of the truck. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported company executives were discussing scrapping the EV version. Ford said that by 2030 roughly half its global volume will consist of hybrids, extended-range vehicles and EVs, up from 17% this year. The shift to hybrids is accelerating around the world, as those vehicles are increasingly seen as more affordable and practical to consumers who are reluctant to commit to pure EVs. To boost revenue, Ford will turn its Kentucky EV-battery factory into a battery-storage business for customers such as utilities, wind- and solar-power developers, and massive data centers that train artificial intelligence.

      "selftext_processed": "Ford Motor said Monday it expected to take about $ 19.5 billion in charges mainly tied to its electricvehicle business a massive hit as the automaker retrenches in the face of sinking EV demand . The sum is among the largest impairments taken by a company and marks the U.S. auto industry ’ s biggest reckoning to date that it can ’ t realize its electricvehicle ambitions anytime soon . Ford which has lost $ 13 billion on its EV business since 2023 said it would bolster its lineup of gaspowered vehicles while shifting to hybrid and socalled extendedrange electric vehicles that include onboard gasoline engines . The goal is to pull back from lossmaking assets and redeploy capital designated for EVs to models with higher profitability . “ Instead of plowing billions into the future knowing these large EVs will never_make money we are pivoting ” Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said in an interview . “ We now know enough about the U.S. market where we have a lot more certainty in this second inning ” of reducedemissions powertrains he said . Regulatory changes and lackluster demand from Americans are forcing U.S. automakers to abandon plans to quickly step to an electricvehicle future . Ford which had bet big on EVs is now making one of the industry ’ s biggest changes to its business . The company said it remains on track to produce a $ 30000 EV pickup for sale by 2027 which the company says will be the first in a new string of lowcost EVs . “ Now this is the core of our EV strategy in America ” Farley said . “ We ’ ve got to land the plane. ” The company will stop making an EV version of its F150 pickup truck called the Lightning and will instead make an extendedrange version of the truck . Last month The Wall Street Journal reported company executives were discussing scrapping the EV version . Ford said that by 2030 roughly half its global volume will consist of hybrids extendedrange vehicles and EVs up from 17 % this year . The shift to hybrids is accelerating around the world as those vehicles are increasingly seen as more affordable and practical to consumers who are reluctant to commit to pure EVs . To boost revenue Ford will turn its Kentucky EVbattery factory into a batterystorage business for customers such as utilities wind and solarpower developers and massive data centers that train artificial intelligence .

      "title": "DD: McDonald's MCD - Burger Joint Is About to Print Money",
      "selftext": "**TLDR**: McDonald's isn't a fast-food company. It's a real estate juggernaut and tech company that happens to sell burgers. With 185 million loyalty users, an AI-powered digital transformation, a plan to add 10,000 restaurants by 2027, and 82% operating margins on franchise income, this \"boring boomer stock\" is about to break out. Stock is trading at $316 near all-time highs and analysts have a $335 target. I think $400+ is in play by end of 2026. \"We Are Not in the Food Business\" Listen up, you degenerate casino patrons. I know what you're thinking - \"MCD? Really? My grandma owns that stock.\" Well guess what? Your grandma is smarter than you, and she's been collecting 2.24% dividends while you've been bag-holding whatever garbage stock some Discord \"guru\" told you to buy. But here's what most people don't understand about McDonald's. Former CFO Harry Sonneborn literally said: \"We are not technically in the food business. We are in the real estate business. The only reason we sell fifteen-cent hamburgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue from which our tenants can pay us rent.\" That's right. McDonald's is essentially a $42 BILLION real estate company that uses hamburgers as a rent collection mechanism. The Golden Arches are basically a REIT with extra steps. The Numbers That Should Make You Hard Let me break down why this stock is criminally undervalued: The Real Estate Empire McDonald's owns ~45% of the land and ~70% of the buildings where its 43,000+ restaurants operate $42 billion in real estate assets on the balance sheet 93% of restaurants are franchised - meaning McDonald's just collects rent and royalties Franchisees pay 4% royalties PLUS 8-15% of sales in rent Operating margin on franchise revenue: 82% (compared to ~16% on company-operated stores) Let that sink in. When you buy a Big Mac, most of that profit doesn't come from the beef patty - it comes from the franchisee paying rent to corporate McDonald's. They've turned fast food into a landlord simulator. 2024-2025 Financials Q3 2025 revenue: $7.078 billion (+3% YoY) Global comparable sales: +3.6% Systemwide sales: $131 billion across 43,000+ locations in 115 markets Market cap: ~$226 billion P/E ratio: 27 Dividend yield: 2.24% (they just raised it 6% in Q3 2024) Free cash flow machine - they literally print money The Catalyst Nobody Is Talking About: \"Digitizing the Arches\" Here's where it gets spicy. McDonald's isn't just sitting on their laurels counting rent checks. They're in the middle of a \"once-in-a-generation\" digital transformation that is absolutely bonkers: AI and Technology Deployment McDonald's partnered with Google Cloud and is rolling out: Restaurant Platform Edge - Cloud computing inside restaurants enabling real-time AI and IoT. Already live in hundreds of U.S. locations. AI-Powered Accuracy Scales - Weighing outgoing orders and flagging missing items BEFORE they leave. Deployed in thousands of restaurants across 12 markets. Virtual AI Manager - Introduced January 2025. This thing schedules crews, audits food safety, handles predictive maintenance, and basically runs the restaurant. Drive-Thru AI - Early pilots show 27 seconds faster service time, 10% more car throughput, and $65,000 additional annual revenue per store. Do the math: If they roll this out to even 20,000 locations, that's $1.3 BILLION in additional annual revenue just from faster drive-thrus. The Loyalty Program is Insane 185 million 90-day active users (as of Q2 2025) Target: 250 million by 2027 U.S. members visit 26 times per year after joining vs. 10.5 times before That's a 147% increase in visits. They're not just selling burgers - they're building a consumer data platform that rivals tech companies. And they just started letting users redeem points for things like Snapchat+ subscriptions. This isn't your grandfather's fast food chain. The Expansion Play: 50,000 Restaurants by 2027 McDonald's is about to experience the fastest unit growth in company history: Opening ~2,200 new restaurants in 2025 Target: 50,000 total restaurants by end of 2027 (up from 43,000 today) 1,000 new stores in China alone in 2025 That's adding roughly the entire Chipotle footprint every 2 years Each new restaurant = more rent, more royalties, more data for the AI systems. Why \"Boring\" = Tendies MCD has a beta of 0.52. That means when the market crashes, this thing barely moves. When your options portfolio is down 80%, McDonald's will be sitting there like a rock, paying dividends. Institutional ownership sits around 70-75% of shares DCFmodeling.com",

With 185 million loyalty users an AIpowered digital transformation a plan to add 10000 restaurants by 2027 and 82 % operating margins on franchise income this boring boomer stock is about to break out . Stock is trading at $ 316 near alltime highs and analysts have a $ 335 target . I think $ 400 is in play by end of 2026 . We Are Not_in the Food Business Listen up you degenerate casino patrons . I know what youre thinking MCD Really My grandma owns that stock . Well guess what Your grandma is smarter than you and shes been collecting 2.24 % dividends while youve been bagholding whatever garbage stock some Discord guru told you to buy . But heres what most people dont understand about McDonalds . Former CFO Harry Sonneborn literally said We are not_technically in the food business . We are in the real estate business .

The Loyalty Program is Insane 185 million 90day active users as of Q2 2025 Target 250 million by 2027 U.S. members visit 26 times per year after joining vs. 10.5 times before Thats a 147 % increase in visits . Theyre not_just selling burgers theyre building a consumer data platform that rivals tech companies . And they just started letting users redeem points for things like Snapchat subscriptions . This isnt your grandfathers fast food chain . The Expansion Play 50000 Restaurants by 2027 McDonalds is about to experience the fastest unit growth in company history Opening 2200 new restaurants in 2025 Target 50000 total restaurants by end of 2027 up from 43000 today 1000 new stores in China alone in 2025 Thats adding roughly the entire Chipotle footprint every 2 years Each new restaurant more rent more royalties more data for the AI systems .

      "title": "Demand on the Rise as Platinum hits $1800 for the First Time in 15 Years",
      "selftext": "On the morning of December 15 2025, the spot price of Platinum reached $1800 per ounce for the first time since 2011, as of now it doesn’t seem to be slowing down as it has continued to rise throughout the day. With increased demand from both retail investors and the jewelry market, coupled with a bright industrial future, investors and Industry may soon be competing over inventory after years of extreme supply deficits and low prices have worn the physical supply thin. The amount of available physical Platinum is a lot less than expected. As of writing this, Platinum is the most undervalued of the big 3 metals. It’s estimated to be 20-30x more rare than gold, and 140x more rare than silver. Despite that, it’s currently trading at a ratio of 27:1 with silver, and a ratio of 1:2.5 with gold. In other words it only takes 27 ounces of silver to get 1 ounce of platinum, and it takes 2.5 ounces of platinum to get 1 ounce of gold. You can see, these numbers don’t really reflect the rarity. The reason for that; Supply and demand. People often say that Platinums lower price is because the metal is not currently in high demand industrially, and fundamentally that is correct, but this is 2025 and Bitcoin exists. Why do BTC investors so vehemently believe in it, why does it keep reaching new heights despite just being numbers on a screen? Scarcity, because there is and will only ever be 21 million BTC. Did you know that there’s less than 0.5 grams of physical Platinum available per person? Once the knowledge of Platinums extreme rarity and supply complications becomes mainstream, metal investors and industry giants could flock to obtain as much as they can, sparking an “altcoin season” in the undervalued precious metals. Some of the more rare metals like Platinum could become hard to obtain very quickly. As of today, there has only ever been enough Platinum mined for each person to have about 0.8 grams, and there’s even less than that available to buy, due to industrial use and hoarding. Less than half a gram of physical Platinum per person. We are well beyond having enough for each person to get half a gram. If we can take anything away from this analysis, I hope it’s seeing the importance of physically owning your families slice of Platinum Pie. This number doesn’t come from thin air. It’s estimated that roughly 321 million ounces of Platinum has been mined. The current global population is roughly 8.3 billion. 321 million divided by 8.3 billion comes out to 0.8 grams per person. To put this into perspective, the total amount of Platinum that has ever been mined can fit inside of an average American home. About 8-10 billion dollars worth of Platinum gets mined annually. But only 1.8-2.7 billion of that goes towards bullion. 40-45% of Platinum gets used in industrial production. 30-35% goes towards jewelry. 20-30% goes towards bullion. If 40% of all Platinum goes towards industrial use, out of 321 million ounces that would be 128 million. That leaves us with 193 million ounces that you can theoretically purchase for investment. But the number is still lower than that if you add jewelry and bullion. Due to variability in prices of jewelry and bullion from irrelevant things like brand names, I won’t be factoring them into this analysis. Doing the same math as before, 193 million divided by 8.3 billion, the new number we get is 0.5 grams of available Platinum per person. Again the real number is even lower still if we were to factor jewelry and bullion in. According to the World Platinum Investment Council, 1.25 billion dollars gets spent from retail investors buying Platinum bullion. If 1.8 billion is spent on producing bullion, this means that the total supply for the year could be within mere hundreds of millions of dollars of being bought out. That much money gets liquidated on a normal day for BTC. You can see that a relatively small growth in investor interest could quickly have a huge impact on the price and availability of physical Platinum. Less than half a gram per person can very quickly disappear if whales get involved. But it’s not just investors that are going to have trouble sourcing Platinum. South Africa is responsible for 70-80% of the world’s Platinum, Russia is 16% of the supply, and Zimbabwe is 8%. This is between 93-100% of the world’s total Platinum. There are other places that produce minor amounts, like Canada. But there’s 1 thing that these 3 major producers have in common, they are all facing major crisis. As far as what we are being told, Platinum production in Russia has not slowed down due to the war. If you aren’t in the know, South Africa and Zimbabwe are not doing so hot. From a volatile political climate, food and water shortages, and major power outages. Pick your poison. South Africa has made some moves towards creating a better power grid which is a positive for the people of South Africa. Zimbabwe is still in a bad way. Ultimately both countries have a long way to go. How do these crisis affect the Platinum price? With electricity being in short supply, it’s in high demand. High energy prices and low Platinum prices creates a situation where the miners are losing money by mining Platinum. Couple this with the fact that Platinum is unbelievably resource intensive to refine due to its extreme heat and corrosion resistance. This is the result; Platinum mines being shut down, delayed, and abandoned. All because the price of Platinum is too low. With recent rises in Platinum prices, the potential for monetary gain for the miners has returned. But years of selling at low prices still weighs heavy over them. I suspect they will want to play it slow to avoid injecting too much Platinum back into the Market and risk getting caught in another cycle of losses. As the supply problem persisted for many years, inevitably the demand for Platinum has greatly outweighed the supply. 2023 and 2024 suffered a 1 million ounce deficit, and 2025 saw a 700,000 ounce deficit. That, and increased investor demand has lead to a near 100% rise in Platinum this year. But it’s not the only precious metal doing good. Gold is up 65% this year, after a 40% rise in 2024, and silver is up 120% this year after a phenomenal 2024. There has been an observable shift in the silver and gold investors. They have begun to notice that the ratios don’t quite make sense. We are beginning to see a trend of people trading in their silver and gold for Platinum. Not only are the retail investors now looking at Platinum as a cheaper investment option, but so is the jewelry market. If this trend breaks out and becomes mainstream, Platinum will quickly skyrocket in price and even a gram could become out of the average retail investor’s price range. The reason for this is simple. The more rare something is, the quicker the total supply can be bought out, which leads to both faster and higher price hikes. This is most certainly a star aligning moment here. If enough retail investors join in this new trend, the whales will take notice and Platinum could genuinely become unobtainable for the average person. However it’s important to consider that in 2022-2023 China, India, and other nations were all massively investing in Platinum. I think it’s because of them that the Platinum market won’t collapse in 2026, after years of deficit, 2026 is projected to potentially break even. It certainly can’t be because of mining, it’s likely these nations are selling their Platinum after profiting almost 100%. This is ultimately good for the retail investors though, as it helps get rid of the maximum available supply. With world changing emerging technologies that use Platinum like hydrogen fuel cells, AI semiconductors, cancer treatments, and the creation of new alloys that can greatly extend the lifespan of things like lithium batteries; Future industrial investment is not only guaranteed, but it’s guaranteed to grow. But what happens when industry can no longer obtain Platinum because of retail competition? It gets priced out of retail. What the retail investor needs to understand about Platinums industrial use is that it is very much a new precious metal. It wasn’t globally refined and considered an element until 1750 because of its unique properties, and we still don’t fully understand these unique properties. This is why Platinum is changing the world, and it’s also why you can still afford it. Your kids might not be able to. There’s simply not enough Platinum to supply an increasing retail and industrial demand, and it’s likely that the industrial demand will be deemed more important. TLDR: Less than half a gram per person currently, a 700,000 oz supply deficit in 2025 after a 1 million oz deficit in 2024 and 2023, an increase in bullion and jewelry demand, and a bright future with industrial demand could make Platinum become damn near unobtainable. You can see why some have begun to consider it the Bitcoin of Precious Metals, it’s a hell of a lot more useful than Bitcoin is too.",

      "selftext_processed": "On the morning of December 15 2025 the spot price of Platinum reached $ 1800 per ounce for the first time since 2011 as of now it doesn ’ t seem to be slowing down as it has continued to rise throughout the day . With increased demand from both retail investors and the jewelry market coupled with a bright industrial future investors and Industry may soon be competing over inventory after years of extreme supply deficits and low prices have worn the physical supply thin . The amount of available physical Platinum is a lot less than expected . As of writing this Platinum is the most undervalued of the big 3 metals . It ’ s estimated to be 2030x more rare than gold and 140x more rare than silver . Despite that it ’ s currently trading at a ratio of 271 with silver and a ratio of 12.5 with gold . In other words it only takes 27 ounces of silver to get 1 ounce of platinum and it takes 2.5 ounces of platinum to get 1 ounce of gold . You can see these numbers don ’ t really reflect the rarity . The reason for that Supply and demand . People often say that Platinums lower price is because the metal is not_currently in high demand industrially and fundamentally that is correct but this is 2025 and Bitcoin exists . Why do BTC investors so vehemently believe in it why does it keep reaching new heights despite just being numbers on a screen Scarcity because there is and will only ever be 21 million BTC . Did you know that there ’ s less than 0.5 grams of physical Platinum available per person Once the knowledge of Platinums extreme rarity and supply complications becomes mainstream metal investors and industry giants could flock to obtain as much as they can sparking an “ altcoin season ” in the undervalued precious metals . Some of the more rare metals like Platinum could become hard to obtain very quickly . As of today there has only ever been enough Platinum mined for each person to have about 0.8 grams and there ’ s even less than that available to buy due to industrial use and hoarding . Less than half a gram of physical Platinum per person . We are well beyond having enough for each person to get half a gram . If we can take anything away from this analysis I hope it ’ s seeing the importance of physically owning your families slice of Platinum Pie . This number doesn ’ t come from thin air . It ’ s estimated that roughly 321 million ounces of Platinum has been mined . The current global population is roughly 8.3 billion . 321 million divided by 8.3 billion comes out to 0.8 grams per person . To put this into perspective the total amount of Platinum that has ever been mined can fit inside of an average American home . About 810 billion dollars worth of Platinum gets mined annually . But only 1.82.7 billion of that goes towards bullion . 4045 % of Platinum gets used in industrial production . 3035 % goes towards jewelry . 2030 % goes towards bullion . If 40 % of all Platinum goes towards industrial use out of 321 million ounces that would be 128 million . That leaves us with 193 million ounces that you can theoretically purchase for investment . But the number is still lower than that if you add jewelry and bullion . Due to variability in prices of jewelry and bullion from irrelevant things like brand names I won ’ t be factoring them into this analysis . Doing the same math as before 193 million divided by 8.3 billion the new number we get is 0.5 grams of available Platinum per person . Again the real number is even lower still if we were to factor jewelry and bullion in . According to the World Platinum Investment Council 1.25 billion dollars gets spent from retail investors buying Platinum bullion . If 1.8 billion is spent on producing bullion this means that the total supply for the year could be within mere hundreds of millions of dollars of being bought out . That much money gets liquidated on a normal day for BTC . You can see that a relatively small growth in investor interest could quickly have a huge impact on the price and availability of physical Platinum . Less than half a gram per person can very quickly disappear if whales get involved . But it ’ s not_just investors that are going to have trouble sourcing Platinum . South Africa is responsible for 7080 % of the world ’ s Platinum Russia is 16 % of the supply and Zimbabwe is 8 % . This is between 93100 % of the world ’ s total Platinum . There are other places that produce minor amounts like Canada . But there ’ s 1 thing that these 3 major producers have in common they are all facing major crisis . As far as what we are being told Platinum production in Russia has not_slowed down due to the war . If you aren ’ t in the know South Africa and Zimbabwe are not_doing so hot . From a volatile political climate food and water shortages and major power outages . Pick your poison . South Africa has made some moves towards creating a better power grid which is a positive for the people of South Africa . Zimbabwe is still in a bad way . Ultimately both countries have a long way to go . How do these crisis affect the Platinum price With electricity being in short supply it ’ s in high demand . High energy prices and low Platinum prices creates a situation where the miners are losing money by mining Platinum . Couple this with the fact that Platinum is unbelievably resource intensive to refine due to its extreme heat and corrosion resistance . This is the result Platinum mines being shut down delayed and abandoned . All because the price of Platinum is too low . With recent rises in Platinum prices the potential for monetary gain for the miners has returned . But years of selling at low prices still weighs heavy over them . I suspect they will want to play it slow to avoid injecting too much Platinum back into the Market and risk getting caught in another cycle of losses . As the supply problem persisted for many years inevitably the demand for Platinum has greatly outweighed the supply . 2023 and 2024 suffered a 1 million ounce deficit and 2025 saw a 700000 ounce deficit . That and increased investor demand has lead to a near 100 % rise in Platinum this year . But it ’ s not_the only precious metal doing good . Gold is up 65 % this year after a 40 % rise in 2024 and silver is up 120 % this year after a phenomenal 2024 . There has been an observable shift in the silver and gold investors . They have begun to notice that the ratios don ’ t quite make sense . We are beginning to see a trend of people trading in their silver and gold for Platinum . Not_only are the retail investors now looking at Platinum as a cheaper investment option but so is the jewelry market . If this trend breaks out and becomes mainstream Platinum will quickly skyrocket in price and even a gram could become out of the average retail investor ’ s price range . The reason for this is simple . The more rare something is the quicker the total supply can be bought out which leads to both faster and higher price hikes . This is most certainly a star aligning moment here . If enough retail investors join in this new trend the whales will take notice and Platinum could genuinely become unobtainable for the average person . However it ’ s important to consider that in 20222023 China India and other nations were all massively investing in Platinum . I think it ’ s because of them that the Platinum market won ’ t collapse in 2026 after years of deficit 2026 is projected to potentially break even . It certainly can ’ t be because of mining it ’ s likely these nations are selling their Platinum after profiting almost 100 % . This is ultimately good for the retail investors though as it helps get rid of the maximum available supply . With world changing emerging technologies that use Platinum like hydrogen fuel cells AI semiconductors cancer treatments and the creation of new alloys that can greatly extend the lifespan of things like lithium batteries Future industrial investment is not_only guaranteed but it ’ s guaranteed to grow . But what happens when industry can no_longer obtain Platinum because of retail competition It gets priced out of retail . What the retail investor needs to understand about Platinums industrial use is that it is very much a new precious metal . It wasn ’ t globally refined and considered an element until 1750 because of its unique properties and we still don ’ t fully understand these unique properties . This is why Platinum is changing the world and it ’ s also why you can still afford it . Your kids might not_be able to . There ’ s simply not_enough Platinum to supply an increasing retail and industrial demand and it ’ s likely that the industrial demand will be deemed more important . TLDR Less than half a gram per person currently a 700000 oz supply deficit in 2025 after a 1 million oz deficit in 2024 and 2023 an increase in bullion and jewelry demand and a bright future with industrial demand could make Platinum become damn near unobtainable . You can see why some have begun to consider it the Bitcoin of Precious Metals it ’ s a hell of a lot more useful than Bitcoin is too ."

Then they sent me another document, but it was much bigger, and I had to sign way more there. At that point I got really confused, because I genuinely have no idea what papers I’m signing and what the words “stock” “stock market” “debenture stock” mean.

Anyways I turned 18 a few days ago and my dad told me to make a “ brokerage account ” sent me a website told me to register I registered He asked his colleagues to help me send a request for something so they sent me some kind of document I signed it . Then they sent me another document but it was much bigger and I had to sign way more there . At that point I got really confused because I genuinely have no_idea what papers I ’ m signing and what the words “ stock ” “ stock market ” “ debenture stock ” mean . I know he has no_bad intentions and I asked him to explain all this to me but unfortunately he doesn ’ t have much patience and gave up on explaining all of this very quickly . I told him that I don ’ t know anything but he doesn ’ t seem to get it . I have no_clue what to do"

      "selftext": "I recently interacted with a financial advisor who is a strong advocate of dividend stock investing for a long-term buy & hold with automatic reinvestment. His thesis was that he could put together a portfolio of 30 stocks that would consistent yield an average of 6% in dividends alone so that his total return was never reliant upon any price appreciation assumptions. He presented some compelling back testing (nobody ever presents lackluster back testing) but generally, the thesis is an interesting one and not something I frequently encounter when working with advisors. I am in wealthtech so I interact with a wide variety of advisors, almost all of whom have their purported secret sauce. I didn't try to see into his black box for screening his 30 stocks, but I posed the question to GPT 5.1 Thinking to see what it yielded. It's a long response, so I've copied it into the pastebin link below. Obviously this would be most attractive in a tax-deferred registration, though I told it to ensure that dividends were qualified so they receive LTCG treatment vs. ordinary income which would make it more tolerable in a taxable account. There is a lot of color in the GPT response, but the example portfolio it provided is included. Other than concentration risk, what could be the potential stumbling blocks of a strategy like this? Cap gains from liquidating and replacing a position that has started failing the screen? (Not relevant in tax-deferred or Roth accounts) I'm not advocating for or against this, just curious.",

      "title": "SpaceX could be the biggest IPO ever next year. How investors can play it now",
      "selftext": "There’s been a lot of renewed chatter around SpaceX finally going public, and if the reported timelines and valuations are even close to accurate, this wouldn’t just be another high-profile IPO it would be a market-defining event. According to recent reports, SpaceX is preparing for a public listing as soon as next year, with a valuation being floated around $1.5 trillion. That would put it well ahead of Saudi Aramco’s 2019 IPO, which currently holds the title for the largest public offering in history. Even a significantly discounted IPO valuation would still land SpaceX among the most valuable companies on the planet from day one. What’s interesting is how wide the ripple effects could be. SpaceX isn’t just a rocket company anymore it’s launch services, Starlink, defense contracts, satellite infrastructure, and potentially a backbone for global connectivity. An IPO at that scale would immediately force investors to rethink valuations across the broader aerospace and defense sector, especially for publicly traded peers that currently trade at a fraction of SpaceX’s implied multiples. The early winners are already obvious. Private investors who got in years ago at far lower valuations stand to see massive gains. Investment banks are likely lining up aggressively for underwriting roles, since a deal of this size would be a rare blockbuster in an IPO market that’s been relatively cautious. Public-market investors, meanwhile, may face a very different question: how much of SpaceX’s future growth is already priced in at a trillion-plus valuation? There’s also the question of timing. Markets are increasingly concentrated in mega-cap names, and a SpaceX IPO would instantly become one of the most influential stocks in major indices if included. That could pull capital from other growth names or even reshape index construction and fund allocations. At the same time, risks shouldn’t be ignored. SpaceX operates in a capital-intensive, regulation-heavy industry, with a CEO who is both a visionary and a source of controversy. Public shareholders would need to get comfortable with volatility, political risk, and long-term execution rather than near-term profitability. Whether or not SpaceX actually comes to market next year, the fact that a $1+ trillion aerospace IPO is even being discussed says a lot about how much the space economy and investor appetite for it has evolved. If it happens, it’s hard to overstate how significant it would be for Wall Street, the space industry, and public markets as a whole. Source",

According to recent reports SpaceX is preparing for a public listing as soon as next year with a valuation being floated around $ 1.5 trillion . That would put it well ahead of Saudi Aramco ’ s 2019 IPO which currently holds the title for the largest public offering in history . Even a significantly discounted IPO valuation would still land SpaceX among the most valuable companies on the planet from day one . What ’ s interesting is how wide the ripple effects could be . SpaceX isn ’ t just a rocket company anymore it ’ s launch services Starlink defense contracts satellite infrastructure and potentially a backbone for global connectivity . An IPO at that scale would immediately force investors to rethink valuations across the broader aerospace and defense sector especially for publicly traded peers that currently trade at a fraction of SpaceX ’ s implied multiples . The early winners are already obvious . Private investors who got in years ago at far lower valuations stand to see massive gains . Investment banks are likely lining up aggressively for underwriting roles since a deal of this size would be a rare blockbuster in an IPO market that ’ s been relatively cautious . Publicmarket investors meanwhile may face a very different question how much of SpaceX ’ s future growth is already priced in at a trillionplus valuation There ’ s also the question of timing . Markets are increasingly concentrated in megacap names and a SpaceX IPO would instantly become one of the most influential stocks in major indices if included . That could pull capital from other growth names or even reshape index construction and fund allocations . At the same time risks shouldn ’ t be ignored . SpaceX operates in a capitalintensive regulationheavy industry with a CEO who is both a visionary and a source of controversy . Public shareholders would need to get comfortable with volatility political risk and longterm execution rather than nearterm profitability . Whether or not_SpaceX actually comes to market next year the fact that a $ 1 trillion aerospace IPO is even being discussed says a lot about how much the space economy and investor appetite for it has evolved . If it happens it ’ s hard to overstate how significant it would be for Wall Street the space industry and public markets as a whole . Source"

      "selftext": "Most microcap pharma press releases read the same: approval today, revenue maybe years later. This one is different. Sunshine Biopharma’s Canadian arm, Nora Pharma, just received Health Canada approval for Domperidone, a widely prescribed gastrointestinal drug. This is not a trial-stage asset or a future filing. It is an approved prescription product entering a regulated market where Sunshine already operates. The company already has more than 60 generic drugs approved in Canada, which means the sales, distribution, and compliance infrastructure is in place. That context matters. Regulatory wins only have value when a company can monetize them. Domperidone adds another revenue-producing SKU to an existing portfolio, not a standalone bet. On top of that, Sunshine has recently launched generic doxycycline 100 mg tablets nationwide in Canada, followed by Pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug with steady long-term demand. Financially, the market is still treating these approvals like abstract progress. Sunshine reported roughly +18% year-over-year revenue growth while the entire company is valued around a $6M market cap. That disconnect is where opportunity is. Do your own research too",

      "selftext_processed": "Most microcap pharma press releases read the same approval today revenue maybe years later . This one is different . Sunshine Biopharma ’ s Canadian arm Nora Pharma just received Health Canada approval for Domperidone a widely prescribed gastrointestinal drug . This is not_a trialstage asset or a future filing . It is an approved prescription product entering a regulated market where Sunshine already operates . The company already has more than 60 generic drugs approved in Canada which means the sales distribution and compliance infrastructure is in place . That context matters . Regulatory wins only have value when a company can monetize them . Domperidone adds another revenueproducing SKU to an existing portfolio not_a standalone bet . On top of that Sunshine has recently launched generic doxycycline 100 mg tablets nationwide in Canada followed by Pravastatin a cholesterollowering drug with steady longterm demand . Financially the market is still treating these approvals like abstract progress . Sunshine reported roughly 18 % yearoveryear revenue growth while the entire company is valued around a $ 6M market cap . That disconnect is where opportunity is . Do your own research too"

With respect to 1) above, I have started doing Roth conversions and plan to continue to age 75. If I do nothing, my estimate is that RMDs will push me into the 24% tax bracket at age 75. I also want to avoid leaving my heirs with a hefty tax bill to pay on their inheritance. The focus of this post is #2 above. I am looking at ways to start an tax-free income stream from our Roth IRAs. Advosors recommend that I consider an annuity, something that will tie up the funds ... and I do not want to do. I am considering investing this money (about $500K into an ETF that pays monthly dividends ... something like PBDC, SPYI, QQQI, or VGI. I calculate that some of these funds will pay about $2,500 per month in distributions if I invest the nearly $500K. Is there any other way (other than an annuity) to generate this level of income?

      "selftext": "As we head into 2026, i see the stock market entering a phase of cautious optimism. Inflationary pressures have eased compared to the last two years, and central banks are signaling a more balanced stance. This creates room for value investors to look beyond defensive plays and start identifying sectors with sustainable growth. The broader market may still face volatility, but opportunities exist for those willing to dig into fundamentals. For the first quarter of the new year, i expect strength in energy transition stocks (companies tied to renewables and grid infrastructure), semiconductors (driven by AI and data center demand), and healthcare innovators (particularly firms with strong pipelines in biotech). These areas combine resilience with long term tailwinds. I am also watching undervalued industrials that benefit from reshoring trends, as they could quietly outperform while the spotlight remains on tech. One advantage of sticking with traditional finance is the transparency and regulatory oversight it provides. Public companies are required to disclose earnings, governance, and risk factors, which gives investors a clearer framework for decision making compared to more speculative markets. Value investing thrives in this environment because it allows us to separate noise from fundamentals and focus on intrinsic worth. That said, i have noticed some platforms have started bridging traditional assets and crypto. Some CEXs, such as Bitget and others, have been rolling out TradFi features. I am curious how others here view this kind of new product?",

Inflationary pressures have eased compared to the last two years and central banks are signaling a more balanced stance . This creates room for value investors to look beyond defensive plays and start identifying sectors with sustainable growth . The broader market may still face volatility but opportunities exist for those willing to dig into fundamentals . For the first quarter of the new year i expect strength in energy transition stocks companies tied to renewables and grid infrastructure semiconductors driven by AI and data center demand and healthcare innovators particularly firms with strong pipelines in biotech . These areas combine resilience with long term tailwinds . I am also watching undervalued industrials that benefit from reshoring trends as they could quietly outperform while the spotlight remains on tech . One advantage of sticking with traditional finance is the transparency and regulatory oversight it provides . Public companies are required to disclose earnings governance and risk factors which gives investors a clearer framework for decision making compared to more speculative markets . Value investing thrives in this environment because it allows us to separate noise from fundamentals and focus on intrinsic worth . That said i have noticed some platforms have started bridging traditional assets and crypto . Some CEXs such as Bitget and others have been rolling out TradFi features . I am curious how others here view this kind of new product"

      "selftext": "Bank of America Securities published its US Rates Watch report on December 12, with a key takeaway that has drawn a lot of attention: the Federal Reserve’s newly launched Reserve Management Purchases (RMPs), while not QE in name, could generate QE-like market effects when combined with Treasury issuance strategy potentially compressing the 10-year Treasury yield by 20–30 basis points. Mechanically, the Fed is expected to purchase approximately $378 billion of Treasury bills via RMPs in calendar year 2026, alongside $181 billion of MBS reinvestments, absorbing roughly $560 billion in bills in total. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury is projected to increase short-term bill issuance by about $500 billion in 2026, while reducing longer dated coupon issuance by roughly $600 billion. As BofA strategist Meghan Swiber puts it, “This parallel offset between the Fed balance sheet and UST issuance has a flavor of financial repression.” Scenario analysis suggests that if the Treasury continues to delay coupon issuance, the cumulative reduction in 10-year duration-equivalent supply over FY26–FY27 could reach $700 billion to $1 trillion, effectively injecting 20–30 bps of net easing into the market. Based on this framework, BofA favors long positions in 2-year swap spreads and 5-year real yields, while remaining bearish on near-term rate volatility. Taken together, the implication is that financial conditions may already be easing even without an explicit shift in the policy rate itself.",

      "selftext_processed": "Bank of America Securities published its US Rates Watch report on December 12 with a key takeaway that has drawn a lot of attention the Federal Reserve ’ s newly launched Reserve Management Purchases RMPs while not_QE in name could generate QElike market effects when combined with Treasury issuance strategy potentially compressing the 10year Treasury yield by 20–30 basis points . Mechanically the Fed is expected to purchase approximately $ 378 billion of Treasury bills via RMPs in calendar year 2026 alongside $ 181 billion of MBS reinvestments absorbing roughly $ 560 billion in bills in total . At the same time the U.S. Treasury is projected to increase shortterm bill issuance by about $ 500 billion in 2026 while reducing longer dated coupon issuance by roughly $ 600 billion . As BofA strategist Meghan Swiber puts it “ This parallel offset between the Fed balance sheet and UST issuance has a flavor of financial repression. ” Scenario analysis suggests that if the Treasury continues to delay coupon issuance the cumulative reduction in 10year durationequivalent supply over FY26–FY27 could reach $ 700 billion to $ 1 trillion effectively injecting 20–30 bps of net easing into the market . Based on this framework BofA favors long positions in 2year swap spreads and 5year real yields while remaining bearish on nearterm rate volatility . Taken together the implication is that financial conditions may already be easing even without an explicit shift in the policy rate itself ."

      "selftext": "The economy will likely perform well at the asset-price level in 2026 after some volatility at the beginning of the year, even as the real economy continues to lag, inflation remains sticky and small business continues to struggle with higher borrowing costs. I could see one of the hyperscalers or Oracle stumbling under the weight of the AI data-center CapEx binge. Oracle, in particular, is levered to heavy infrastructure spending in a cloud market where it lacks the scale advantages of its peers. This growth scare will be triggered by another bad earnings call showing a gap between soaring CapEx and the conversion of its backlog into billable cloud revenue. If they keep spending without near-term revenue to match, the market will continue to reprice the stock downward, emphasizing its negative free cash flow and debt load. They won’t be allowed to fail however. Between regulatory forbearance and government contracts, a de facto bailout is the base case. Ellison being tight with Trump just makes that protection more explicit. The priority will be preserving asset values and the rent streams tied to them, while the real economy continues to absorb the losses, with this wealth effect supporting prices. Markets are likely to re-inflate mid-year, as Q2 earnings, CapEx spending milestones, and government contract renewals confirm that the hyperscalers and Oracle remain systemically supported. Data center buildouts likely mark the peak of the CapEx cycle, and those positioned closest to these capital flows will do well. We may also see a genuine breakthrough in chip efficiency or processing speed that will extend asset valuations a bit longer, but only by masking the slowdown beneath. That’s how I anticipate the next year playing out.",

I could see one of the hyperscalers or Oracle stumbling under the weight of the AI datacenter CapEx binge . Oracle in particular is levered to heavy infrastructure spending in a cloud market where it lacks the scale advantages of its peers . This growth scare will be triggered by another bad earnings call showing a gap between soaring CapEx and the conversion of its backlog into billable cloud revenue . If they keep spending without nearterm revenue to match the market will continue to reprice the stock downward emphasizing its negative free cash flow and debt load . They won ’ t be allowed to fail however . Between regulatory forbearance and government contracts a de facto bailout is the base case . Ellison being tight with Trump just makes that protection more explicit . The priority will be preserving asset values and the rent streams tied to them while the real economy continues to absorb the losses with this wealth effect supporting prices . Markets are likely to reinflate midyear as Q2 earnings CapEx spending milestones and government contract renewals confirm that the hyperscalers and Oracle remain systemically supported . Data center buildouts likely mark the peak of the CapEx cycle and those positioned closest to these capital flows will do well . We may also see a genuine breakthrough in chip efficiency or processing speed that will extend asset valuations a bit longer but only by masking the slowdown beneath . That ’ s how I anticipate the next year playing out ."

      "selftext": "I closed my positions in QFIN and FINV last week. This isn’t a rage quit and it’s not because I think the companies are trash. I still think both are real businesses. But I don’t like the setup anymore, and cheap stocks can stay cheap longer than your patience. When I bought them the thesis was straightforward: • Profitable fintech platforms • Real scale • Strong data and risk models • Trading at very low multiples On paper, that’s usually a good combo. What changed? Three things broke the setup. 1) Regulation is back in the driver’s seat China rolled out a new consumer finance framework in late 2025. The legal interest cap didn’t change, but the economics did. Loan pricing is coming down in practice. Banks are taking more control of underwriting and post-loan management. Fintech platforms are getting paid lower fees for the same work. That’s a margin squeeze, full stop. When your business model depends on spread and fees, this matters more than valuation. 2) Credit risk ticked up Both QFIN and FINV saw early delinquency metrics worsen in Q3. Not a crisis, but enough to force tighter underwriting. That creates a bad loop: • Credit risk rises • Platforms tighten lending • Growth slows • Market loses patience 3) Guidance rolled over This was the final nail for me. QFIN guided to a sharp year-over-year earnings drop in Q4. FINV cut its growth outlook to low single digits. That tells you management is playing defense, not offense. Defensive mode + regulatory pressure rarely leads to multiple expansion. But aren’t they cheap? Yes. Very, under 4x earnings. And that’s the trap. Chinese fintech sentiment is awful. Investors don’t trust the regulatory backdrop, don’t trust the macro, and don’t trust that rules won’t change again. You can argue that’s irrational. You can also watch stocks go nowhere for two years while being “right.” These aren’t broken companies. They’re businesses caught in a tough regulatory and macro box. I’d rather step aside, redeploy capital, and focus on setups where the path forward is clearer. You can take the contrarian view but your capital will be stuck for a couple of years going no where.",

I still think both are real businesses . But I don ’ t like the setup anymore and cheap stocks can stay cheap longer than your patience . When I bought them the thesis was straightforward • Profitable fintech platforms • Real scale • Strong data and risk models • Trading at very low multiples On paper that ’ s usually a good combo . What changed Three things broke the setup . 1 Regulation is back in the driver ’ s seat China rolled out a new consumer finance framework in late 2025 . The legal interest cap didn ’ t change but the economics did . Loan pricing is coming down in practice . Banks are taking more control of underwriting and postloan management . Fintech platforms are getting paid lower fees for the same work . That ’ s a margin squeeze full stop . When your business model depends on spread and fees this matters more than valuation . 2 Credit risk ticked up Both QFIN and FINV saw early delinquency metrics worsen in Q3 . Not_a crisis but enough to force tighter underwriting . That creates a bad loop • Credit risk rises • Platforms tighten lending • Growth slows • Market loses patience 3 Guidance rolled over This was the final nail for me . QFIN guided to a sharp yearoveryear earnings drop in Q4 . FINV cut its growth outlook to low single digits . That tells you management is playing defense not_offense . Defensive mode regulatory pressure rarely leads to multiple expansion . But aren ’ t they cheap Yes . Very under 4x earnings . And that ’ s the trap . Chinese fintech sentiment is awful . Investors don ’ t trust the regulatory backdrop don ’ t trust the macro and don ’ t trust that rules won ’ t change again . You can argue that ’ s irrational . You can also watch stocks go nowhere_for two years while being “ right. ” These aren ’ t broken companies . They ’ re businesses caught in a tough regulatory and macro box . I ’ d rather step aside redeploy capital and focus on setups where the path forward is clearer . You can take the contrarian view but your capital will be stuck for a couple of years going no_where ."

      "title": "Zillow stock falls as Google tests new real estate ad format",
      "selftext": "Investing.com -- Zillow Group Inc (NASDAQ:ZG) stock fell over 5.5% Monday as investors reacted to news that Google is testing a new real estate advertising format that could potentially compete with Zillow's services. The search giant has introduced a mobile-centric real estate ad format that provides comprehensive property details, options to request home tours, and displays similar listings directly within search results. This new format allows users to schedule home showings with \"top-rated\" local agents through a \"Request a tour\" button, with an expected response time of 15 minutes. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng noted that while the immediate impact on Zillow may be limited, the development represents a potential long-term risk. \"While we don't expect a direct near-term impact on Zillow's business, given that most of Zillow's traffic is direct and Google's new product is currently limited to select markets and mobile browsers, we view this development as a long-term risk for real estate portals like Zillow,\" wrote Ng, who maintains a Neutral rating on the stock. Google's new ad product is a collaboration with real estate analytics and brokerage firm ComeHome, which sources listings reportedly from the Multiple Listing Service rather than directly from listing agents. The format directly competes with Zillow's Premier Agent program by facilitating lead generation for buy-side agents from prospective homebuyers. The new Google feature embeds capabilities typically found on real estate portals, including filters for bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, price, and new listing status, potentially challenging Zillow's position as a go-to destination for home searches. Key Points Google appears to be running tests on putting real estate sale listings into its search results. The listings allowed users to view the full details of a property’s page, request a tour and contact an agent — similar to the functions offered on Zillow.com’s online marketplace portal. “While we don’t expect a direct near-term impact on Zillow’s business ... we view this development as a long-term risk for real estate portals like Zillow,” Goldman Sachs’ Michael Ng said.",

      "selftext_processed": "Investing.com Zillow Group Inc NASDAQZG stock fell over 5.5 % Monday as investors reacted to news that Google is testing a new real estate advertising format that could potentially compete with Zillows services . The search giant has introduced a mobilecentric real estate ad format that provides comprehensive property details options to request home tours and displays similar listings directly within search results . This new format allows users to schedule home showings with toprated local agents through a Request a tour button with an expected response time of 15 minutes . Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng noted that while the immediate impact on Zillow may be limited the development represents a potential longterm risk . While we dont expect a direct nearterm impact on Zillows business given that most of Zillows traffic is direct and Googles new product is currently limited to select markets and mobile browsers we view this development as a longterm risk for real estate portals like Zillow wrote Ng who maintains a Neutral rating on the stock . Googles new ad product is a collaboration with real estate analytics and brokerage firm ComeHome which sources listings reportedly from the Multiple Listing Service rather than directly from listing agents . The format directly competes with Zillows Premier Agent program by facilitating lead generation for buyside agents from prospective homebuyers . The new Google feature embeds capabilities typically found on real estate portals including filters for bedrooms bathrooms square footage price and new listing status potentially challenging Zillows position as a goto destination for home searches . Key Points Google appears to be running tests on putting real estate sale listings into its search results . The listings allowed users to view the full details of a property ’ s page request a tour and contact an agent — similar to the functions offered on Zillow.com ’ s online marketplace portal . “ While we don ’ t expect a direct nearterm impact on Zillow ’ s business ... we view this development as a longterm risk for real estate portals like Zillow ” Goldman Sachs ’ Michael Ng said ."

      "selftext": "Key events this week include Tuesday's delayed release of the November jobs report and Friday's options expiration. Additionally, year end activities like window dressing, portfolio rebalancing, and tax loss harvesting enter their final window, with positioning for next year becoming the primary focus. Sector rotation is expected to continue. President Trump is poised to select his nominee for Federal Reserve Chair. Furthermore, a ruling on the constitutionality of reciprocal tariffs could be announced at any time. Weekend news flow was relatively quiet. The broader market failed to extend Friday's decline and rebounded moderately in premarket trading. SPY held its key support level on Friday, marking the 13th consecutive trading day of consolidation within a high-range. This signals a potential inflection point. Intraday, the lower support zone remains $679-$682, while resistance is tested at $688-$691 (this range slopes upward, with its boundaries shifting higher over time). Most stocks rose premarket, led by memory chips and equipment, copper and silver mining, and nuclear power. Tesla (TSLA) saw rumors over the weekend that its Robotaxi service has begun true driverless operations. Pre market, the stock again tested the upper boundary of its recent consolidation range around $470. A decisive break above this level could target new all time highs. NOW Technology's proposed $7 billion acquisition of Armis sent its shares down 5%. Today, continue monitoring the direction of leading AI related tech stocks, which need to stabilize quickly after Friday's sharp decline. This represents solely my personal view and strategy for reference only.",

      "selftext": "With many companies seemingly IPO’ing at outrageous valuations to give VCs and angels an exit, does it usually take time for prices to reset before a sustainable uptrend begins? How do people here usually evaluate whether an IPO is overvalued or fairly priced? In cases like HOOD or Figma, many felt the valuation was too stretched, meaning it could take years before the stock becomes a good entry despite strong businesses and that’s what happened somewhat with HOOD. Do most of you focus on peer multiples, revenue growth, margins, and long-term TAM when deciding to participate? Given that, do you think a more reasonably valued IPO with solid future prospects -like Medline -offers a better risk-reward at entry? What overvalued IPOs ever make sense as an entry? Taking examples of upcoming IPO’s like SpaceX - slightly overvalued, Stripe, data-bricks, Anduril (don’t know about them) but medline looks kinda good but don’t know if it would be multi-bagger. So, throw your reasoning about what worked and what didn’t worked and how you will play 2026 IPO’s. Let’s win together. Make it a thread people come back and learn and we all win together. TIA.",

      "selftext_processed": "With many companies seemingly IPO ’ ing at outrageous valuations to give VCs and angels an exit does it usually take time for prices to reset before a sustainable uptrend begins How do people here usually evaluate whether an IPO is overvalued or fairly priced In cases like HOOD or Figma many felt the valuation was too stretched meaning it could take years before the stock becomes a good entry despite strong businesses and that ’ s what happened somewhat with HOOD . Do most of you focus on peer multiples revenue growth margins and longterm TAM when deciding to participate Given that do you think a more reasonably valued IPO with solid future prospects like Medline offers a better riskreward at entry What overvalued IPOs ever make sense as an entry Taking examples of upcoming IPO ’ s like SpaceX slightly overvalued Stripe databricks Anduril don ’ t know about them but medline looks kinda good but don ’ t know if it would be multibagger . So throw your reasoning about what worked and what didn ’ t worked and how you will play 2026 IPO ’ s . Let ’ s win together . Make it a thread people come back and learn and we all win together .

      "selftext": "I’ve been seeing a massive uptick in ads and articles lately pitching Private Equity and Private Credit to everyday retail investors. The narrative is always the same: the brokers claim they want to give us access to the same high returns that endowments and the ultra-wealthy have enjoyed for years. But I’ve been digging into the market data and I’m convinced this is fishy as fuck. It looks a lot less like an opportunity for us and a lot more like a desperate need for exit liquidity for the big players. Institutional investors like pension funds and endowments are currently \"over-allocated\" to private markets. Because public stocks took a hit or stayed flat over the last couple of years while private valuations didn't mark down as fast, their portfolios are out of balance. They are effectively tapped out. They can't put more money in, and more importantly, they are screaming for cash distributions. They want their money back, but VCs and PE firms are struggling to give it to them because the IPO market is tepid and M&A is slow. This is where the retail investor comes in. Since the \"smart money\" is tapped out, Wall Street needs a new ocean of capital to keep the machine running. They need someone to buy the assets that the older funds need to sell. You can see this clearly in the AI sector. We all know valuations for AI startups like OpenAI are completely disconnected from reality, often trading at over 100 times revenue with little to no profit. Hedge funds and VCs who bought in during the 2021 hype or the recent AI boom are sitting on massive paper gains, but they having the problem, that if they would try to IPO these companies right now, the public markets might reject those valuations, forcing a \"down round\" that crushes their returns and makes them lose a shit ton of money. The solution is to avoid the public market entirely. Instead, they move these assets into \"continuation funds\" or sell them on the secondary market. And who is financing this? It’s retail capital. They are effectively moving assets from the pockets of savvy institutional investors who want out into the pockets of retail investors who are just getting in. The most dangerous part is how they structure it. They sell these as \"semi-liquid\" funds, but the liquidity is an illusion. These funds have \"gates,\" meaning that if everyone panics and tries to sell at once, like in a recession, they simply lock the door. We saw this with Blackstone’s real estate fund recently. So you basically become the bag holder for assets that are too expensive for the public market to touch. Just know that when you hear about the \"democratization of finance\" be very careful. “Democratization” usually happens right at the end of a cycle when the insiders need someone to sell to, true to the motto: privatize earnings, socialize losses.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been seeing a massive uptick in ads and articles lately pitching Private Equity and Private Credit to everyday retail investors . The narrative is always the same the brokers claim they want to give us access to the same high returns that endowments and the ultrawealthy have enjoyed for years . But I ’ ve been digging into the market data and I ’ m convinced this is fishy as fuck . It looks a lot less like an opportunity for us and a lot more like a desperate need for exit liquidity for the big players . Institutional investors like pension funds and endowments are currently overallocated to private markets . Because public stocks took a hit or stayed flat over the last couple of years while private valuations didnt mark down as fast their portfolios are out of balance . They are effectively tapped out . They cant put more money in and more importantly they are screaming for cash distributions . They want their money back but VCs and PE firms are struggling to give it to them because the IPO market is tepid and MA is slow . This is where the retail investor comes in . Since the smart money is tapped out Wall Street needs a new ocean of capital to keep the machine running . They need someone to buy the assets that the older funds need to sell . You can see this clearly in the AI sector . We all know valuations for AI startups like OpenAI are completely disconnected from reality often trading at over 100 times revenue with little to no_profit . Hedge funds and VCs who bought in during the 2021 hype or the recent AI boom are sitting on massive paper gains but they having the problem that if they would try to IPO these companies right now the public markets might reject those valuations forcing a down round that crushes their returns and makes them lose a shit ton of money . The solution is to avoid the public market entirely . Instead they move these assets into continuation funds or sell them on the secondary market . And who is financing this It ’ s retail capital . They are effectively moving assets from the pockets of savvy institutional investors who want out into the pockets of retail investors who are just getting in . The most dangerous part is how they structure it . They sell these as semiliquid funds but the liquidity is an illusion . These funds have gates meaning that if everyone panics and tries to sell at once like in a recession they simply lock the door . We saw this with Blackstone ’ s real estate fund recently . So you basically become the bag holder for assets that are too expensive for the public market to touch . Just know that when you hear about the democratization of finance be very careful . “ Democratization ” usually happens right at the end of a cycle when the insiders need someone to sell to true to the motto privatize earnings socialize losses ."

In cases like HOOD or Figma, many felt the valuation was too stretched, meaning it could take years before the stock becomes a good entry despite strong businesses and that’s what happened somewhat with HOOD. Do most of you focus on peer multiples, revenue growth, margins, and long-term TAM when deciding to participate? Given that, do you think a more reasonably valued IPO with solid future prospects -like Medline -offers a better risk-reward at entry? What overvalued IPOs ever make sense as an entry? Taking examples of upcoming IPO’s like SpaceX - slightly overvalued, Stripe, data-bricks, Anduril (don’t know about them) but medline looks kinda good but don’t know if it would be multi-bagger. So, throw your reasoning about what worked and what didn’t worked and how you will play 2026 IPO’s. Let’s win together. Make it a thread people come back and learn and we all win together. TIA.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been working on a macro \"regime filter\" designed to detect high-probability crash environments with minimal lag. The goal wasn’t to build a high-frequency trading bot, but a robust asset allocation strategy that protects capital during deep corrections while participating in bull markets. I recently finished a realistic 20-year backtest (2005–Present) covering the GFC, 2018 Volmageddon, Covid-19, and the 2022 inflation bear market. **The Strategy Concept** The logic is simple: * **Risk-On:** When the market structure is healthy, go **100% SPY** (S&P 500). * **Risk-Off:** When the signal flags a \"Bear Regime,\" switch **100% to GLD** (Gold). **The \"Secret Sauce\" (Without giving it away)** Most indicators are lagging (like a simple 200 SMA). My signal combines trend following with **tail-risk pricing metrics** (measuring the market's perception of outlier events) to identify structural weakness before the floor falls out. **The Setup (Realistic Constraints)** I hate backtests that ignore costs or assume instant execution. To make this realistic: * **Rebalancing:** Weekly (Checked Friday close, Executed Monday open). * **Transaction Costs:** Included (7 bps per trade). * **Slippage/Lag:** Accounted for by executing the next trading day after the signal. **The Results (2005 - 2025)** Initial Capital: $10,000 |**Metric**|**Buy & Hold (SPY)**|**Risk-On/Off Strategy**|**Difference**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Final Value**|$83,297|**$181,817**|\\+$98,520| |**CAGR**|10.67%|**14.88%**|\\+4.21%| |**Max Drawdown**|\\-55.2%|**-32.9%**|Reduced Risk| |**Sharpe Ratio**|0.56|**0.88**|\\+0.32| |**Trades/Year**|0|**\\~7.7**|Low Frequency| |**Worst Year**|\\-36.8%|**-8.5%**|Crisis Alpha| **Why Weekly Rebalancing?** I tested Daily, Weekly, and Monthly frequencies. * **Daily:** Too much noise. Whipsaws destroyed returns via transaction costs. * **Monthly:** Too slow. By the time you switch to Gold, the crash has already happened (e.g., Covid 2020). * **Weekly:** The sweet spot. It filters out noise but reacts fast enough to catch major regime shifts. **Key Takeaway** The outperformance didn't come from leverage or picking penny stocks. It came from **avoiding the math of big losses.** * In 2008, SPY drew down over 50%. This strategy pivoted to Gold, preserving capital. * By capping the downside, the compounding base remained high for the recovery.",

The goal wasn ’ t to build a highfrequency trading bot but a robust asset allocation strategy that protects capital during deep corrections while participating in bull markets . I recently finished a realistic 20year backtest 2005–Present covering the GFC 2018 Volmageddon Covid19 and the 2022 inflation bear market . The Strategy Concept The logic is simple RiskOn When the market structure is healthy go 100 % SPY SP 500 . RiskOff When the signal flags a Bear Regime switch 100 % to GLD Gold . The Secret Sauce Without giving it away Most indicators are lagging like a simple 200 SMA . My signal combines trend following with tailrisk pricing metrics measuring the markets perception of outlier events to identify structural weakness before the floor falls out . The Setup Realistic Constraints I hate backtests that ignore costs or assume instant execution . To make this realistic Rebalancing Weekly Checked Friday close Executed Monday open . Transaction Costs Included 7 bps per trade . SlippageLag Accounted for by executing the next trading day after the signal . The Results 2005 2025 Initial Capital $ 10000 MetricBuy Hold SPYRiskOnOff StrategyDifference Final Value $ 83297 $ 181817 $ 98520 CAGR10.67 % 14.88 % 4.21 % Max Drawdown55.2 % 32.9 % Reduced Risk Sharpe Ratio0.560.880.32 TradesYear07.7Low Frequency Worst Year36.8 % 8.5 % Crisis Alpha Why Weekly Rebalancing I tested Daily Weekly and Monthly frequencies . Daily Too much noise . Whipsaws destroyed returns via transaction costs . Monthly Too slow . By the time you switch to Gold the crash has already happened e.g . Covid 2020 . Weekly The sweet spot . It filters out noise but reacts fast enough to catch major regime shifts . Key Takeaway The outperformance didnt come from leverage or picking penny stocks . It came from avoiding the math of big losses . In 2008 SPY drew down over 50 % . This strategy pivoted to Gold preserving capital . By capping the downside the compounding base remained high for the recovery ."

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** **My take: MSTR doesn’t survive more than \\~3 years in most realistic scenarios.** BTC down → MSTR dies fast. BTC flat → MSTR bleeds out paying dividends + interest. BTC goes mainstream → ETFs kill the premium and dilution stops working. Different paths, same ending. Longer version for anyone who still has attention span: I’ve been looking at MSTR for a while and I honestly don’t see a future where this thing works long term unless Bitcoin keeps doing insane, volatile bull runs forever *and* the market keeps clapping while getting diluted. At this point MSTR isn’t a software company. It’s a leveraged Bitcoin balance sheet with a legacy business taped on. The stock trades like BTC on steroids. That’s great when BTC is ripping. It’s terrible when time passes. Here’s the part people gloss over: MSTR has real cash bills. Preferred dividends. Interest. Normal company expenses. Roughly a few hundred million a year that has to be paid in cash. The software business doesn’t cover it. So the whole strategy boils down to two options: * keep issuing stock * or eventually sell Bitcoin Issuing stock only works if MSTR trades at a premium to the Bitcoin it already owns. That premium is the entire engine. Once it shrinks, dilution stops being “genius capital markets strategy” and starts being “why am I getting wrecked every quarter.” We already saw MSTR trade close to its BTC value. That’s the model coughing. Everyone thinks a BTC crash is the risk. I think boring Bitcoin is worse. If BTC just chops sideways for a year or two, volatility dries up, hype fades, and the premium slowly leaks away while dividends and interest keep draining cash. Cash reserves buy time, not survival. And here’s the ironic part: if Bitcoin actually *wins* and becomes mainstream, I still don’t think MSTR wins. In that world, people buy ETFs or hold BTC directly. No dilution. No debt. No CEO risk. MSTR goes from “unique BTC proxy” to “why would I own this instead of IBIT?” So take your pick: * BTC crashes → MSTR blows up * BTC goes sideways → MSTR bleeds out * BTC becomes fully adopted → MSTR becomes irrelevant The only universe where this works long term is one where Bitcoin keeps delivering face-ripping bull runs forever and investors keep accepting dilution indefinitely. That’s not a business model, that’s a belief system. Not saying it won’t pump again. It probably will. This thing feeds on volatility and vibes. But zoom out and it feels less like a company and more like a countdown. That’s my take. Flame away. **Some actual math:** * **Bitcoin held:** \\~**650,000 BTC** (varies slightly with recent buys; order of magnitude matters) * **BTC value (at $90k):** 650,000 × 90,000 ≈ **$58.5B** * **Cash on hand / reserve:** \\~**$1.3–1.5B** (company explicitly set this aside for dividends + debt service) * **Annual preferred dividends:** ≈ **$85–90M per year** (cash, not optional long term) * **Annual interest expense:** Roughly **$200–250M per year** across converts + senior notes * **Total fixed cash burn:** ≈ **$300–340M per year** (before software ops, which are roughly breakeven at best) * **Runway math (flat BTC, no new dilution):** $1.4B ÷ $320M ≈ **4.3 years** * **More realistic runway (assuming some continued buying / volatility):** **\\~2.5–3.5 years** * **Important detail:** * Interest on debt → **cannot be skipped** without default * Preferred dividends → can be deferred temporarily, but **they accumulate** and make refinancing harder * Software business → does **not** cover these obligations * **Key structural issue:** The moment MSTR trades near or below BTC NAV, issuing stock becomes value-destructive → dilution stops working → cash runway becomes the only clock. * **What forces BTC selling:** Flat BTC + compressed premium + fixed cash burn = **selling BTC becomes rational**, not ideological. Position: Small position, adding slowly. No options access as a foreign investor so adding MSTZ. Yes, decay sucks — but it’s still the cleanest way for me to play this. ￼​(DD assisted by AI)",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR My take MSTR doesn ’ t survive more than 3 years in most realistic scenarios . BTC down → MSTR dies fast . BTC flat → MSTR bleeds out paying dividends interest . BTC goes mainstream → ETFs kill the premium and dilution stops working . Different paths same ending . Longer version for anyone who still has attention span I ’ ve been looking at MSTR for a while and I honestly don ’ t see a future where this thing works long term unless Bitcoin keeps doing insane volatile bull runs forever and the market keeps clapping while getting diluted . At this point MSTR isn ’ t a software company . It ’ s a leveraged Bitcoin balance sheet with a legacy business taped on . The stock trades like BTC on steroids . That ’ s great when BTC is ripping . It ’ s terrible when time passes . Here ’ s the part people gloss over MSTR has real cash bills . Preferred dividends . Interest . Normal company expenses . Roughly a few hundred million a year that has to be paid in cash . The software business doesn ’ t cover it . So the whole strategy boils down to two options keep issuing stock or eventually sell Bitcoin Issuing stock only works if MSTR trades at a premium to the Bitcoin it already owns . That premium is the entire engine . Once it shrinks dilution stops being “ genius capital markets strategy ” and starts being “ why am I getting wrecked every quarter. ” We already saw MSTR trade close to its BTC value . That ’ s the model coughing . Everyone thinks a BTC crash is the risk . I think boring Bitcoin is worse . If BTC just chops sideways for a year or two volatility dries up hype fades and the premium slowly leaks away while dividends and interest keep draining cash . Cash reserves buy time not_survival . And here ’ s the ironic part if Bitcoin actually wins and becomes mainstream I still don ’ t think MSTR wins . In that world people buy ETFs or hold BTC directly . No_dilution . No_debt . No_CEO risk . MSTR goes from “ unique BTC proxy ” to “ why would I own this instead of IBIT ” So take your pick BTC crashes → MSTR blows up BTC goes sideways → MSTR bleeds out BTC becomes fully adopted → MSTR becomes irrelevant The only universe where this works long term is one where Bitcoin keeps delivering faceripping bull runs forever and investors keep accepting dilution indefinitely . That ’ s not_a business model that ’ s a belief system . Not_saying it won ’ t pump again . It probably will . This thing feeds on volatility and vibes . But zoom out and it feels less like a company and more like a countdown . That ’ s my take . Flame away . Some actual math Bitcoin held 650000 BTC varies slightly with recent buys order of magnitude matters BTC value at $ 90k 650000 × 90000 ≈ $ 58.5B Cash on hand reserve $ 1.3–1.5B company explicitly set this aside for dividends debt service Annual preferred dividends ≈ $ 85–90M per year cash not_optional long term Annual interest expense Roughly $ 200–250M per year across converts senior notes Total fixed cash burn ≈ $ 300–340M per year before software ops which are roughly breakeven at best Runway math flat BTC no_new dilution $ 1.4B ÷ $ 320M ≈ 4.3 years More realistic runway assuming some continued buying volatility 2.5–3.5 years Important detail Interest on debt → can not be skipped without default Preferred dividends → can be deferred temporarily but they accumulate and make refinancing harder Software business → does not cover these obligations Key structural issue The moment MSTR trades near or below BTC NAV issuing stock becomes valuedestructive → dilution stops working → cash runway becomes the only clock . What forces BTC selling Flat BTC compressed premium fixed cash burn selling BTC becomes rational not_ideological . Position Small position adding slowly . No_options access as a foreign investor so adding MSTZ . Yes decay sucks — but it ’ s still the cleanest way for me to play this . ￼​DD assisted by AI"

      "selftext": "I know a lot of people see NVDA as a “never sell” kind of stock, especially with how strong it’s been the past few years. It’s obviously been a big winner for many, and it feels like it still has room to run with AI and data center demand. But I’m curious, at what point do you actually take some profit or rotate into something else? Maybe when the growth slows? Or valuation stretches too far? Or if competition heats up in the AI space and margins start to compress? I’m not planning to sell right now, and I’m definitely bullish long term. But I’m also trying to be a little more thoughtful about my positions and not just say “I’ll hold forever” without having some kind of plan. Do you have a specific metric or condition that would make you reduce your position? Or are you just holding for the long haul and planning to reassess down the road?",

It ’ s obviously been a big winner for many and it feels like it still has room to run with AI and data center demand . But I ’ m curious at what point do you actually take some profit or rotate into something else Maybe when the growth slows Or valuation stretches too far Or if competition heats up in the AI space and margins start to compress I ’ m not_planning to sell right now and I ’ m definitely bullish long term . But I ’ m also trying to be a little more thoughtful about my positions and not_just say “ I ’ ll hold forever ” without having some kind of plan . Do you have a specific metric or condition that would make you reduce your position Or are you just holding for the long haul and planning to reassess down the road"

If you bought lululemon 10 years ago when they were all wearing it you’d be rich now \\- if you can’t afford an $15 salad then this isn’t for you. Go buy your $12 value meal \\- no one has ever complained about “sweetgreen shits” like they do with chipotle. Also all the others still use seed oils and make compromises with quality.

      "selftext": "Hear me out because I think many people do not consider this. 1. Many people will withdraw their investments when they *have to*, not when the market is particularly suitable for withdrawal. 2. This means that the market's average annual returns over the past 50 years don't mean that much if it just so happens that you have to withdraw during a market downturn. 3. This means the \"average return\" you are likely interested in is not \"average return till now\" - it's the average of \"return till X period, return till 2X period, return till 3X period, ... return till now\". This is a relatively different number from the \"average return till now\" number - depending on how you pick the \"X period\". This \"X period\" dictates your actual risk appetite IMO. For someone who feels they might have to withdraw on a day's notice (X = 1 day), the actual average return is a lot lower. Even with 1 month's notice it comes to around 7% per my calculations, not the standard 12% annual returns people assume. Now I understand there is also a large number of people investing for whom this is not strictly relevant because they have a decent emergency corpus. But nowadays many people are investing without that cover in place. The closest industry term I can find is \"AHPR\" (average holding period return) but it's not quite the same it seems? And also not that widely discussed. IMO it's unfair to the normal middle class investors that this is not clearly communicated to them. Thoughts?",

Many people will withdraw their investments when they have to not_when the market is particularly suitable for withdrawal . 2 . This means that the markets average annual returns over the past 50 years dont mean that much if it just so happens that you have to withdraw during a market downturn . 3 . This means the average return you are likely interested in is not_average return till now its the average of return till X period return till 2X period return till 3X period ... return till now . This is a relatively different number from the average return till now number depending on how you pick the X period . This X period dictates your actual risk appetite IMO . For someone who feels they might have to withdraw on a days notice X 1 day the actual average return is a lot lower . Even with 1 months notice it comes to around 7 % per my calculations not_the standard 12 % annual returns people assume . Now I understand there is also a large number of people investing for whom this is not_strictly relevant because they have a decent emergency corpus . But nowadays many people are investing without that cover in place . The closest industry term I can find is AHPR average holding period return but its not_quite the same it seems And also not_that widely discussed . IMO its unfair to the normal middle class investors that this is not_clearly communicated to them . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "Hey all, I’m looking to start building a Section 8 portfolio and wanted to get some feedback from those of you who’ve already gone down this path. Full disclosure: I’m not here for the “don’t do it” horror stories, I know there are risks with Section 8 tenants, just like any other type of tenant, and I firmly believe it all comes down to proper screening. A little about my situation: I’m based in Florida, but I’m considering investing out of state. Florida’s a tough market for single-family homes, especially with high insurance costs and the ever-present risk of hurricanes. I’m thinking I can find better stability elsewhere, but I need some advice on where exactly to focus. A few specific questions: * Where are you currently investing to expand your Section 8 portfolio? * How did you determine the market you’re investing in is solid for Section 8? * I’ve heard mixed things about Detroit, the houses are dirt cheap, but what’s the catch? Is it really a bad spot for Section 8? * Is a 5% ROI (after property management, mortgage, etc.) considered too low? I know ROI can vary, but what do you typically look for as a “sweet spot” for a sustainable portfolio? * Do you focus on 2-bed, 3-bed, or 4-bed units? Why? I’d love to hear your reasoning on what works best for Section 8 tenants and the numbers behind it. Any other tips you think or anyone do I need to follow, suggestions would be helpful, especially in terms of market selection or best practices for managing Section 8 properties, would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

      "selftext": "The current S&P 500 bull market turned three years old in October 2025. Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist of financial services firm Carson Group, points out that once a bull market hits three years, it has a much better chance of stretching to an average of eight years, based on analysis of data going back to 1950. Detrick's confidence in this market stems from the healthy earnings growth that tech companies have been clocking. Additionally, HSBC analysts expect the S&P 500 index to hit 7,500 levels, driven by the sustained spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Technology stocks in particular have clocked impressive returns in 2025, as is evident from the 22% gains registered by the tech-heavy **Nasdaq Composite** index. The good news for tech investors is that the Nasdaq is likely to head higher in 2026 as well, driven by a broader market rally. With gains of 81% so far in 2025, **Advanced Micro Devices** (NASDAQ: AMD) stock has outperformed the broader **PHLX Semiconductor Sector** index's 46% gains by a wide margin. This solid performance is a result of AMD's growing stature in the artificial intelligence data center market, where its graphics processing units (GPUs) and server processors are experiencing healthy demand. **Alphabet** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another Nasdaq stock that has done pretty well on the market in 2025, registering 67% gains as of this writing. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock's healthy gains aren't surprising, as Alphabet has been growing at a healthy pace thanks to its AI investments. Whats your take on these two... are there better buys right now?",

      "selftext_processed": "The current SP 500 bull market turned three years old in October 2025 . Ryan Detrick the chief market strategist of financial services firm Carson Group points out that once a bull market hits three years it has a much better chance of stretching to an average of eight years based on analysis of data going back to 1950 . Detricks confidence in this market stems from the healthy earnings growth that tech companies have been clocking . Additionally HSBC analysts expect the SP 500 index to hit 7500 levels driven by the sustained spending on artificial intelligence AI infrastructure . Technology stocks in particular have clocked impressive returns in 2025 as is evident from the 22 % gains registered by the techheavy Nasdaq Composite index . The good news for tech investors is that the Nasdaq is likely to head higher in 2026 as well driven by a broader market rally . With gains of 81 % so far in 2025 Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD stock has outperformed the broader PHLX Semiconductor Sector indexs 46 % gains by a wide margin . This solid performance is a result of AMDs growing stature in the artificial intelligence data center market where its graphics processing units GPUs and server processors are experiencing healthy demand . Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is another Nasdaq stock that has done pretty well on the market in 2025 registering 67 % gains as of this writing . The Magnificent Seven stocks healthy gains arent surprising as Alphabet has been growing at a healthy pace thanks to its AI investments . Whats your take on these two ... are there better buys right now"

      "selftext": "I think many people misunderstand Tower Semiconductor ($TSEM). They keep looking at it as if it’s just another foundry. The real story is that AI data centers are hitting physics limits, and Tower is in a unique position in the supply chain that addresses these limitations. Here’s what I mean. This week, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan expressed what many engineers already know: co-packaged optics (CPO) are taking longer to develop than expected, and pluggable optics will be the standard for a while longer. Copper reaches its limits, then pluggables will lead the next phase, and only later will we move deeper into CPO. That’s significant because Tower is where pluggables are enabled. Tower doesn’t sell the pluggable modules found in data centers. Instead, they are the \"boring but essential\" layer beneath it. They make the specialty silicon (silicon photonics and analog/power components) that much of the optics ecosystem relies on. And it’s not a small ecosystem. Industry analysts report that Tower has over 50 silicon photonics customers, including 7 of the top 11 datacom transceiver makers. These transceiver companies sell into hyperscalers, forming a chain that looks like this: $TSEM → transceiver makers → hyperscalers like $AMZN (AWS), $GOOGL, $MSFT, $META. A clear example is InnoLight, a key player in optics/transceivers, which has partnered with Tower to build high-speed transceivers on Tower’s PH18 silicon photonics platform. InnoLight sells to hyperscalers. That shows the real connection in practice. Now, what makes this more than just \"another AI stock\" is the physics. Tower’s partnership with Anello Photonics demonstrates their capabilities with ultra-low-loss silicon nitride waveguides. This kind of \"on-chip optics\" performance is hard to replicate and is crucial for precise photonics, like photonic gyros. Anello has received U.S. Navy SBIR awards for their work, and Tower has noted that this process can also be used for other customers. Then there’s third-party validation: - Coherent recognized Tower as an innovation and technology supplier related to silicon photonics transceivers. - Northrop Grumman has consistently acknowledged Tower as a top supplier. This isn’t just marketing; these organizations don’t give out awards lightly. Tower is also not limited to one small fabrication plant. They have significant geographic reach, including a majority stake (51%) in their operation in Japan (TPSCo). This matters when customers are concerned about capacity and reliability. Meanwhile, competitors are responding as expected when a niche becomes strategically vital: - $GFS is investing deeper into silicon photonics. - $INTC attempted to buy Tower outright. This indicates that the narrative of \"Tower is special\" isn't just a retail story. So the takeaway is straightforward: If pluggables are the near-term reality, and Broadcom has just reinforced that, then the companies enabling pluggables at scale are the ones to focus on. Tower appears less like a \"foundry stock\" and more like a key supplier in the AI optics ecosystem, with actual traction, solid customers, and an edge in physics. That’s why the demand appears \"sensational.\" It’s not random; it’s structural. $TSEM $AMZN $GOOGL $MSFT $META $AVGO $INTC $GFS",

      "selftext_processed": "I think many people misunderstand Tower Semiconductor $ TSEM . They keep looking at it as if it ’ s just another foundry . The real story is that AI data centers are hitting physics limits and Tower is in a unique position in the supply chain that addresses these limitations . Here ’ s what I mean . This week Broadcom CEO Hock Tan expressed what many engineers already know copackaged optics CPO are taking longer to develop than expected and pluggable optics will be the standard for a while longer . Copper reaches its limits then pluggables will lead the next phase and only later will we move deeper into CPO . That ’ s significant because Tower is where pluggables are enabled . Tower doesn ’ t sell the pluggable modules found in data centers . Instead they are the boring but essential layer beneath it . They make the specialty silicon silicon photonics and analogpower components that much of the optics ecosystem relies on . And it ’ s not_a small ecosystem . Industry analysts report that Tower has over 50 silicon photonics customers including 7 of the top 11 datacom transceiver makers . These transceiver companies sell into hyperscalers forming a chain that looks like this $ TSEM → transceiver makers → hyperscalers like $ AMZN AWS $ GOOGL $ MSFT $ META . A clear example is InnoLight a key player in opticstransceivers which has partnered with Tower to build highspeed transceivers on Tower ’ s PH18 silicon photonics platform . InnoLight sells to hyperscalers . That shows the real connection in practice . Now what makes this more than just another AI stock is the physics . Tower ’ s partnership with Anello Photonics demonstrates their capabilities with ultralowloss silicon nitride waveguides . This kind of onchip optics performance is hard to replicate and is crucial for precise photonics like photonic gyros . Anello has received U.S. Navy SBIR awards for their work and Tower has noted that this process can also be used for other customers . Then there ’ s thirdparty validation Coherent recognized Tower as an innovation and technology supplier related to silicon photonics transceivers . Northrop Grumman has consistently acknowledged Tower as a top supplier . This isn ’ t just marketing these organizations don ’ t give out awards lightly . Tower is also not_limited to one small fabrication plant . They have significant geographic reach including a majority stake 51 % in their operation in Japan TPSCo . This matters when customers are concerned about capacity and reliability . Meanwhile competitors are responding as expected when a niche becomes strategically vital $ GFS is investing deeper into silicon photonics . $ INTC attempted to buy Tower outright . This indicates that the narrative of Tower is special isnt just a retail story . So the takeaway is straightforward If pluggables are the nearterm reality and Broadcom has just reinforced that then the companies enabling pluggables at scale are the ones to focus on . Tower appears less like a foundry stock and more like a key supplier in the AI optics ecosystem with actual traction solid customers and an edge in physics . That ’ s why the demand appears sensational . It ’ s not_random it ’ s structural . $ TSEM $ AMZN $ GOOGL $ MSFT $ META $ AVGO $ INTC $ GFS"

I’m investing 150 euros per month, split between: * 60 euros into VWCE (FTSE All-World ETF) * 90 euros into CSPX (S&P 500 ETF) This means about 40% in VWCE and 60% in CSPX.

      "selftext": "Wall Street sentiment is starting to shift more positively heading into 2026, especially after the S&P 500 and Dow both hit record highs in the same week the Federal Reserve delivered a rate cut. The timing mattered markets were already on solid footing, and the policy move helped reinforce the idea that financial conditions may stay supportive for longer. What really stood out to investors were Jerome Powell’s comments after the Fed meeting. Instead of pushing back hard against easing expectations, Powell sounded noticeably less hawkish than many feared. That tone gave markets room to breathe, especially after months of uncertainty around inflation, growth, and the labor market. It doesn’t mean risks are gone valuations are still stretched in parts of the market, and economic data remains mixed but the combination of rate relief and calmer Fed messaging has clearly improved confidence. Right now, it feels like investors are less focused on short-term scares and more willing to look ahead into 2026 with a bit more optimism. Curious how others see it: is this the start of a steadier phase for markets, or just another relief rally before the next macro test? Source: [",

      "selftext": "I’ve always been of the mindset that having some physical gold is important. I know there are many that might disagree, that’s okay, I have my own reasons. But I’ve recently been considering just going all in on gold. Currently, I have a decent emergency fund and a little extra. Then most of my money is in an all world fund (S&S ISA) and a little bit in gold. I don’t have any plans for any big purchases on the horizon. I’m not sure I’ll ever buy a house or start a business. I don’t need access to my funds for the foreseeable future. It seems that gold is pretty solid and will sometimes spike and dip occasionally. Should I just invest purely in gold? I’ll probably just hold onto it and maybe sell some when the market spikes every now and then. I’ll keep a little bit in the all world fund and I’ll buy more of that when it dips (with the money from gold when it spikes). I’ll continue to pay normally into my pension which is in an all world fund also. What do you think?",

I occassionaly do purchases in yen (from different account where i have saved up yen) and generaly would prefer the shares to be done in yen without any currency exchanges. That leads me to the question, if transfering is possible, whats the cost, and your recommendations to where to transfer. Probably my location and shae name would be helpful information - germany, shares Cover Corp. 5253.T (you can roast my sentiment purchase if you have nothing else to do xD)",

      "selftext": "Hello, as a non US and non EU resident, I would love to get an opinion on this dilemma that I have. Right now, I’m holding accumulating Ireland domiciled ETFs as a way to prevent US estate tax and US withholding tax. The tax officials of my country of residence still told me to report its notional distribution using the UK tax reporting documents provided by the fund manager on a reporting period basis. What I’m worried about is that by relying on another country for tax treatment, a possible change in how UK treat accumulating ETF will result in me having to sell my investment due to not being able to report the dividends generated anymore. For example: as of now, a tax reporting document will be provided by the fund manager on a reporting period basis on their website and can be accessed by everyone but what if this law is removed or the tax reporting information is moved to the UK tax reporting platform? I would have no way to access this at all. What do you think about this? Do you think I should keep my S&P500 + Developed Markets Ex. US ETFs or move completely to Gold or Silver since it doesn’t distribute dividends anyways so regardless of changes, there is nothing for me to report? I’m also down to changing to VT or VTI + VXUS and just realize the gains later when I’m close to retirement but of course, death is always around the corner (I may be overthinking, I’m still 21).",

      "selftext": "Hi all, Curious to hear what everyone’s thinking for 2026 and beyond. A bunch of outlook reports are out, including Vanguard’s latest (VEMO 2026): Vanguard VEMO 2026 Report: Dummary from report: Global diversification remains key, US large-cap growth is expected to have lower long-term returns, and they favor Fixed Income, US Value, and Non-US Developed Markets over the next 5–10 years. My Take & Plan:- I’m all about diversification and the “VT and Chill” approachit fits nicely with most long-term outlooks and I sleep well at night with it. My investments is and keeps being: Core: VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) – sticking with it as my main holding. Small Tilt: A bit into growth/tech through the nasdaq and BTC, but VT remains the core. I reduced both tilts considerably and increased the VT base. Discussion Points Is Vanguard’s latest outlook/other major inestment firms' outlooks changing how you’re thinking about 2026? Would love to hear your thoughts!",

A bunch of outlook reports are out including Vanguard ’ s latest VEMO 2026 Vanguard VEMO 2026 Report Dummary from report Global diversification remains key US largecap growth is expected to have lower longterm returns and they favor Fixed Income US Value and NonUS Developed Markets over the next 5–10 years . My Take Plan I ’ m all about diversification and the “ VT and Chill ” approachit fits nicely with most longterm outlooks and I sleep well at night with it . My investments is and keeps being Core VT Vanguard Total World Stock ETF – sticking with it as my main holding . Small Tilt A bit into growthtech through the nasdaq and BTC but VT remains the core .

      "selftext": "I have a 401k and a work Roth, a personal roth and brokerage account. In 2025 i maxed out my personal Roth and contributed about 10k to my brokerage account. I don’t recall exactly how much I added to my 401 k maybe 18k and 5 k to my work roth. Im debating if there is any benefit into contributing to my personal Roth and brokerage account before I’ve maxed out my 401k? The reason I did this during 2025 is because I could select what I purchased with my contributions such as stocks and ETF as opposed to just having my employer/ vanguard manage the funds I add through my direct deposit funds. The only benefit I see is the money being tax free. Are there any other advantages that I am missing? Should I continue this way or max out my 401k for the year first?",

      "selftext": "Not investment advice to buy. I own shares. Seems like a classic value unlocking play. Why interesting and boring? Well first of all it’s a conglomerate, hence probably wont explode and isn’t for day trading. Interesting? I’ll explain below. They already spun off the materials business back in Oct 2025. Since then the spinoff went up 3% but Honeywell went down 6%. The big catalyst is coming in 2026 when they seperate Aerospace. Should trade at a higher multiple as a standalone company. Also nobody talks about the quantum stake. They own 54% of Quantinuum. Based on the last valutation their stake is worth like $5B which is basically a free option embedded in the price. Quantum computing might be the next AI play? Maybe? Quantinuum might IPO in 2027. Price targets 230-260 USD. Now at 191. The fundementals seem fair here. Trading around 20x PE with a 2.5% dividend. Cash flow is strong but top line growth is slow. Is this a value trap or a smart sum of parts play. Anyone else buying?",

      "selftext": "I was born in the 90s, but learned that people were getting 10% APY on CDs in the 80s. That sounds like an absolute dream. An older coworker mentioned that interest rates were in the double digits as well but it would be worth it for me as someone not trying to buy a house. I guess I’m just wondering if folks here think it’s possible for rates to get to that level again. Even 5-6% APY would be amazing. Mainly because I’d love a risk free way to save. Right now, everything except my emergency fund is in the stock market, which has treated me well but I know that that money is not super liquid and the market can drop at any time. In 2023/4, I had a 5.1% CD and just wish we had that option (or better) all the time. It’s stressful having to invest in the stock market just to keep up with inflation since HYSA rates are not very HY. EDIT: I didn’t know inflation was 12% during the same time period. It did sound too good to be true…",

      "selftext": "I’ve been tracking the narrative around Fast Casual and Sweetgreen ($SG) for a while now, and if you listen to the headlines, you’d think this company is about five minutes away from bankruptcy. The current sentiment is that we are in a \"slop bowl recession\", but I thought the market was missing something huge, so I spoke with their Head of Investor Relations (Rebecca Nounou) and went deep down the rabbit hole. After looking at the tech, the macro setup, and the insane float structure, I think this is one of the most asymmetric risk/reward plays in the market right now. Here is the full breakdown. # The \"Slop\" Narrative vs. Reality The biggest bear case right now is that Sweetgreen is just overpriced \"slop\" that consumers are abandoning. I wanted to verify if the product quality was actually slipping. I sat down with a legit NYC food stylist (someone who gets paid to make food look good on camera) to analyze the bowls. We concluded that it's probably not slop, given the ingredients, verified local sourcing, exclusive use of EVOO and avocado oil, and complex recipes. While the internet calls it slop, the actual product is \"premium casual.\" IR pushed back hard on the slop narrative too, citing the specific family farms they support. The point here is that the product moat is real; nobody else is doing farm-to-table supply chains at this scale. They aren't just reheating Sysco bags. # Scale & Fixing Operations (The \"Infinite Kitchen\") This is the most critical part of the thesis that people are sleeping on. The number one complaint about $SG is portion inconsistency; the dreaded \"skimp.\" Sweetgreen is currently rolling out the **Infinite Kitchen**. These are automated assembly units that dispense ingredients by precise weight. They can crank out 500 meals an hour. I asked Rebecca about this, and she confirmed that customer complaints drop significantly in stores with these machines because it removes human error. But it’s not just about happier customers; it’s about \"Economic Complexity.\" Think about Nokia. Nokia started as a paper mill chopping down trees, then pivoted to rubber, then to tech. They moved from raw resource extraction to complex technology. Sweetgreen is doing the same thing. The market values them like a lemonade stand, but they are building a proprietary robotics platform. They are betting the house on automation and digital platforms, and if it works, their margins are going to decouple from the rest of the restaurant industry. Another interesting thing is that they sold the subsidiary behind Infinite Kitchen, Spyce Technology, to Wonder. Wonder owns Grubhub and has a legendary founder/CEO trying to blow up the ghost kitchen space. SG got a $100m lifeline and about a 1.2% in Wonder. They also retain licensing rights to the automated machines and get the right to purchase it at Cost + 5%. So as Wonder scales the tech, SG will disproportionately benefit. # The Social and Economic Macro We are sitting in late 2025. Consumer sentiment is trash, tariffs are flying, and the K-shaped economy is squeezing the middle class. IR was honest with me and mentioned they are seeing the 25-35-year-old cohort trade down. They are losing the \"entry-level white collar\" lunch crowd in coastal cities. However, I think this is temporary. There's a shift underway on both the fiscal and monetary front. The price of real assets is rising, like gold, and stocks, and the fed is cutting rates, stimulating the economy. You also have to look at the massive cultural shift toward \"Longevity.\" We are living in the age of Bryan Johnson, Oura Rings, and seed-oil disrespect. Health is the primary status symbol right now. People are tired of paying restaurant prices for garbage food. There is a massive \"Trade Up\" happening where people are leaving generic fast food for \"clean eating.\" Sweetgreen is perfectly positioned to capture the demographic that views lunch as a health investment, not just calories. The analogy I like here is the trade people went from Nike when I was a kid to Lululemon and premium athleisurewear. # Financial Analysis I dug into the balance sheet to see if they can actually survive long enough for this thesis to play out. First, the margins. Last year they achieve 20% restaurant-level margins, so they can get back there. Also, the Infinite Kitchen can cut labor costs by 7 points at least, according to performance of existing IK-fitted stores. They are also shifting real estate strategy to the suburbs, which lowers occupancy costs. If they execute, they can get to mid-20% restaurant-level margins (Chipotle territory). Second, the cash. They ended Q3 with about $130M, but they just sold their Spyce technology to Wonder for $100M plus equity. That puts their liquidity around $230M. Based on their current burn, they have runway through 2027. They aren't going insolvent. They are also being disciplined with capital via cutting net new store openings to 15-20 next year to focus only on \"A+ real estate.\" Finally, the main thing they need to drive down is G&A, which is currently way higher than peers at 18%. The sale of Spyce does lower this 2-3% points right away, and there are other levers to pull. Sweetgreen also recently hired an ex-Chipotle exec as their DAO to help with margins. # Meme Potential (Seriously) There are some parts about the stock that make me think it has huge meme potential going forwards. I looked at the ownership structure. 95% of Sweetgreen’s shares are held by institutions and insiders. That means the actual \"float\" available for retail traders to buy and sell is tiny ... only about 5% of the company. On top of that, 25% of the float is short. This is a powder keg. Because the tradable supply is so low, any spike in demand (from a good earnings beat or a macro shift) creates a liquidity crisis for the shorts. There just aren't enough shares available to buy back. We’ve seen this setup before with other highly shorted, low-float stocks. Finally, there's an invite-only membership tier called having \"Goat Status\". Those with Goat Status get a black bag when they pick up, among other perks. Who in their right mind wouldn't want to be a Sweetgreen GOAT??? *(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence. I am long $SG)*",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been tracking the narrative around Fast Casual and Sweetgreen $ SG for a while now and if you listen to the headlines you ’ d think this company is about five minutes away from bankruptcy . The current sentiment is that we are in a slop bowl recession but I thought the market was missing something huge so I spoke with their Head of Investor Relations Rebecca Nounou and went deep down the rabbit hole . After looking at the tech the macro setup and the insane float structure I think this is one of the most asymmetric riskreward plays in the market right now . Here is the full breakdown . The Slop Narrative vs . Reality The biggest bear case right now is that Sweetgreen is just overpriced slop that consumers are abandoning . I wanted to verify if the product quality was actually slipping . I sat down with a legit NYC food stylist someone who gets paid to make food look good on camera to analyze the bowls . We concluded that its probably not_slop given the ingredients verified local sourcing exclusive use of EVOO and avocado oil and complex recipes . While the internet calls it slop the actual product is premium casual . IR pushed back hard on the slop narrative too citing the specific family farms they support . The point here is that the product moat is real nobody_else is doing farmtotable supply chains at this scale . They arent just reheating Sysco bags . Scale Fixing Operations The Infinite Kitchen This is the most critical part of the thesis that people are sleeping on . The number one complaint about $ SG is portion inconsistency the dreaded skimp . Sweetgreen is currently rolling out the Infinite Kitchen . These are automated assembly units that dispense ingredients by precise weight . They can crank out 500 meals an hour . I asked Rebecca about this and she confirmed that customer complaints drop significantly in stores with these machines because it removes human error . But it ’ s not_just about happier customers it ’ s about Economic Complexity . Think about Nokia . Nokia started as a paper mill chopping down trees then pivoted to rubber then to tech . They moved from raw resource extraction to complex technology . Sweetgreen is doing the same thing . The market values them like a lemonade stand but they are building a proprietary robotics platform . They are betting the house on automation and digital platforms and if it works their margins are going to decouple from the rest of the restaurant industry . Another interesting thing is that they sold the subsidiary behind Infinite Kitchen Spyce Technology to Wonder . Wonder owns Grubhub and has a legendary founderCEO trying to blow up the ghost kitchen space . SG got a $ 100m lifeline and about a 1.2 % in Wonder . They also retain licensing rights to the automated machines and get the right to purchase it at Cost 5 % . So as Wonder scales the tech SG will disproportionately benefit . The Social and Economic Macro We are sitting in late 2025 . Consumer sentiment is trash tariffs are flying and the Kshaped economy is squeezing the middle class . IR was honest with me and mentioned they are seeing the 2535yearold cohort trade down . They are losing the entrylevel white collar lunch crowd in coastal cities . However I think this is temporary . Theres a shift underway on both the fiscal and monetary front . The price of real assets is rising like gold and stocks and the fed is cutting rates stimulating the economy . You also have to look at the massive cultural shift toward Longevity . We are living in the age of Bryan Johnson Oura Rings and seedoil disrespect . Health is the primary status symbol right now . People are tired of paying restaurant prices for garbage food . There is a massive Trade Up happening where people are leaving generic fast food for clean eating . Sweetgreen is perfectly positioned to capture the demographic that views lunch as a health investment not_just calories . The analogy I like here is the trade people went from Nike when I was a kid to Lululemon and premium athleisurewear . Financial Analysis I dug into the balance sheet to see if they can actually survive long enough for this thesis to play out . First the margins . Last year they achieve 20 % restaurantlevel margins so they can get back there . Also the Infinite Kitchen can cut labor costs by 7 points at least according to performance of existing IKfitted stores . They are also shifting real estate strategy to the suburbs which lowers occupancy costs . If they execute they can get to mid20 % restaurantlevel margins Chipotle territory . Second the cash . They ended Q3 with about $ 130M but they just sold their Spyce technology to Wonder for $ 100M plus equity . That puts their liquidity around $ 230M . Based on their current burn they have runway through 2027 . They arent going insolvent . They are also being disciplined with capital via cutting net new store openings to 1520 next year to focus only on A real estate . Finally the main thing they need to drive down is GA which is currently way higher than peers at 18 % . The sale of Spyce does lower this 23 % points right away and there are other levers to pull . Sweetgreen also recently hired an exChipotle exec as their DAO to help with margins . Meme Potential Seriously There are some parts about the stock that make me think it has huge meme potential going forwards . I looked at the ownership structure . 95 % of Sweetgreen ’ s shares are held by institutions and insiders . That means the actual float available for retail traders to buy and sell is tiny ... only about 5 % of the company . On top of that 25 % of the float is short . This is a powder keg . Because the tradable supply is so low any spike in demand from a good earnings beat or a macro shift creates a liquidity crisis for the shorts . There just arent enough shares available to buy back . We ’ ve seen this setup before with other highly shorted lowfloat stocks . Finally theres an inviteonly membership tier called having Goat Status . Those with Goat Status get a black bag when they pick up among other perks . Who in their right mind wouldnt want to be a Sweetgreen GOAT Disclaimer This is not_financial advice . Do your own due diligence . I am long $ SG"

I added these numbers for each stock to create what I call Value Points. A score above 40 represents the top 15% of the sample group. The next step is to determine whether these stocks are undervalued or overvalued relative to their Value Points. Using Zacks.com’s stock screener, I downloaded all public stocks with: (1) market cap above $100 billion, (2) TTM operating margin above 0%, and (3) revenue growth forecast above 0%. This screen gave me 118 stocks. I then put those stocks in a scatter plot to identify the value stocks: [Mega Cap Value Score]( The Value Score is the ratio of the Value Points divided by the Enterprise Value/Projected Operating Profit multiple. I consider a Value Score above 2.0 as a potential Buy. A Value Score below 1.0 is considered overpriced and a potential Sell. Some of the standout stocks are well-known including NVDA, TSM, NVO and MU. I’ve written before about the financial stocks SCHW and V as potential BUYs. Unfortunately, the market has not yet come around on these ones. One big caveat is that Zacks is a free stock screener and has plenty of outdated or incorrect data. Please do your own due diligence before buying any stock based on this analysis. \\[edit\\] I added the data behind the chart in a separate tab.",

I added these numbers for each stock to create what I call Value Points . A score above 40 represents the top 15 % of the sample group . The next step is to determine whether these stocks are undervalued or overvalued relative to their Value Points . Using Zacks.com ’ s stock screener I downloaded all public stocks with 1 market cap above $ 100 billion 2 TTM operating margin above 0 % and 3 revenue growth forecast above 0 % . This screen gave me 118 stocks . I then put those stocks in a scatter plot to identify the value stocks Mega Cap Value Score The Value Score is the ratio of the Value Points divided by the Enterprise ValueProjected Operating Profit multiple . I consider a Value Score above 2.0 as a potential Buy . A Value Score below 1.0 is considered overpriced and a potential Sell . Some of the standout stocks are wellknown including NVDA TSM NVO and MU . I ’ ve written before about the financial stocks SCHW and V as potential BUYs . Unfortunately the market has not_yet come around on these ones . One big caveat is that Zacks is a free stock screener and has plenty of outdated or incorrect data . Please do your own due diligence before buying any stock based on this analysis . edit I added the data behind the chart in a separate tab ."

The firm just agreed to buy Innovator Capital Management for $2 billion, a company best known for its defined outcome (buffer) ETFs. These products use options to cap both downside risk and upside returns, making them especially popular with investors who want some protection without fully exiting equities. The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year, and Goldman executives are already calling buffer ETFs a major growth area for the industry. Given how volatile markets have been and how nervous a lot of investors feel about valuations going into 2026 it’s not hard to see why. Feels like another sign that big asset managers are positioning for a world where investors care less about max returns and more about risk management. Curious if anyone here actually uses buffer ETFs, or if most still prefer simple index funds and bonds for protection. Source:",

      "selftext": "We've been living with social media for close to 20 years now, and have willingly given the companies our data in exchange for interaction and entertainment. Generally, we accept that they profit by selling our data for targeted ads. I used to buy dark ads though META's Ad Manager in 2019. It started out very effective, but over time I watched the (non-bot) engagement go down while the price per click continued to go up. I haven't bought ads in over a year, but a quick search says the average cost per click is now around $.50. I was paying less than $.10 for a while there. As more and more ads were sold, it made greater competition for ad space and the rate went up - Easy to see how META makes a ton of money with this model. But doesn't it seem like FB/IG has begun to run its course as far as people wanting to use it? How and why do you see it maintaining and growing the Ad revenue in the long term? What's META platform gonna look like in 3 years? I think unless its something completely different, a lot of people will continue to check out. Lately there's a lot of resentment/backlash/reluctance (at least by non-boomers) to reduce our exposure to social media; as we now know the companies intentionally fuel societal/political division, contribute to emotional damage in kids. It seems that less people are posting personal content on a regular basis, sharing less. This makes the 'digital creators' who think the world needs to hear from them every day a larger part of the feed alongside all the paid Ad content. FB/IG are just less engaging than they once were. Unless you're watching reels - which, like tiktok just sucks people into an addictive and mindless loop of 10 second videos leading to 'brain-rot' - People are finally recognizing the harm of social media. Have a look at Australia's new social media ban for kids - coming soon to US. What impact will this have on META ad sales? I just don't see how it continues to grow with so many forces against it. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. TLDR \\~ I don't think META will continue to increase revenue. They might even be the company that doesn't make it through the AI bubble.",

      "selftext": "Most of the headlines this week focused on Todd Combs leaving Berkshire Hathaway, but the broader message in the announcement matters just as much. The company is clearly transitioning toward a more traditional corporate structure as Warren Buffett prepares to hand over the CEO role to Greg Abel in a matter of weeks. Combs, who joined Berkshire in 2010 and later became CEO of GEICO, is heading to JPMorgan Chase to run a new $10 billion Strategic Investment Group tied to its massive $1.5 trillion Security and Resiliency Initiative. It’s a big vote of confidence from JPM, and even Buffett acknowledged the move, saying JPMorgan “made a good decision.” Beyond Combs, the personnel changes suggest Berkshire is tightening roles and formalizing leadership in a way that feels very different from the loose, Buffett-centric setup of the past. That doesn’t mean the culture is gone but it does mean the era of Berkshire running purely on Buffett’s instincts is ending. Feels less like a sudden shift and more like a careful, deliberate handoff. Curious how others see it: smooth evolution, or the beginning of a very different Berkshire? Source:",

      "selftext_processed": "Most of the headlines this week focused on Todd Combs leaving Berkshire Hathaway but the broader message in the announcement matters just as much . The company is clearly transitioning toward a more traditional corporate structure as Warren Buffett prepares to hand over the CEO role to Greg Abel in a matter of weeks . Combs who joined Berkshire in 2010 and later became CEO of GEICO is heading to JPMorgan Chase to run a new $ 10 billion Strategic Investment Group tied to its massive $ 1.5 trillion Security and Resiliency Initiative . It ’ s a big vote of confidence from JPM and even Buffett acknowledged the move saying JPMorgan “ made a good decision. ” Beyond Combs the personnel changes suggest Berkshire is tightening roles and formalizing leadership in a way that feels very different from the loose Buffettcentric setup of the past . That doesn ’ t mean the culture is gone but it does mean the era of Berkshire running purely on Buffett ’ s instincts is ending . Feels less like a sudden shift and more like a careful deliberate handoff . Curious how others see it smooth evolution or the beginning of a very different Berkshire Source"

      "selftext": "I guess the question is when to dip in. With price targets for 2026, averaging $458, that is a ton of gain potential with the after hours close Friday of $357.20. My belief is the constant chatter by low brows of an “AI bubble,” on a few platforms, is changing market psychology. It’s anyone’s guess as to when that might turn the corner from fear to greed again. The last time AVGO dipped substantially was tariff week. I picked up 1,200 shares for about $155. I’ve stayed long since and make a steady income selling calls. Another buying opportunity?: This Friday, I used the dip to boost up a position in Vertiv Holdings. The last lot I got for $160.20. If that were to continue Monday, I would buy more. With a peg ratio of 1.3, and a 5 year growth rate projected to be 30+%, I can’t understand how Wolfe Research reduced VRT to peer perform.",

My belief is the constant chatter by low brows of an “ AI bubble ” on a few platforms is changing market psychology . It ’ s anyone ’ s guess as to when that might turn the corner from fear to greed again . The last time AVGO dipped substantially was tariff week . I picked up 1200 shares for about $ 155 . I ’ ve stayed long since and make a steady income selling calls . Another buying opportunity This Friday I used the dip to boost up a position in Vertiv Holdings . The last lot I got for $ 160.20 . If that were to continue Monday I would buy more . With a peg ratio of 1.3 and a 5 year growth rate projected to be 30 % I can ’ t understand how Wolfe Research reduced VRT to peer perform ."

      "selftext": "TMUS, probably the most oversold large cap stock in the market. It consistently bounces off its 150 SMA - shown on a weekly chart here - where it finds itself once again. The fundamental case of why TMUS can meaningfully appreciate from here: Sustained, above-consensus subscriber growth (volume engine): T-Mobile reported record postpaid customer additions in 2025 (millions of net adds across postpaid phone, other and prepaid from acquisitions), with large quarterly adds cited by the company and industry press. Strong net adds drive recurring service revenue, ARPU stability/upside, and superior churn economics vs. peers. This growth is the primary revenue engine that will compound cash flows. ￼ 5G leadership and network scale that converts into share gains: T-Mobile built a broad mid-band 5G footprint faster than peers after the Sprint merger; that scale is translating to competitive advantage for coverage + performance, especially for price-sensitive consumers and suburban/rural areas. Faster, cheaper 5G motivates upgrades (premium plans, 5G broadband) and supports new services (fixed 5G broadband, enterprise customers). Company commentary and analysts emphasize its network-driven wins. Diversifying revenue: broadband & fiber tuck-ins T-Mobile is not just phones — they’ve added 5G broadband customers and have acquired fiber customers (e.g., Metronet acquisitions) to scale fixed connectivity offerings. Owning both wireless and fiber/fixed broadband increases wallet share per household and improves lifetime value. ￼ Material free-cash-flow (FCF) tailwinds + aggressive capital returns: Management has increased guidance for EBITDA and FCF; the company just authorized a large $14.6B shareholder return program (through 2026) and raised its quarterly dividend — this both reduces share count and returns cash to investors, supporting EPS growth and multiple expansion. Buybacks + dividend increase are direct catalysts for total return. ￼ Room for margin expansion (profit curve + operating leverage): As service revenue scales faster than incremental capex (once major 5G build is complete) and as fixed costs are spread over more subscribers, EBITDA margins can improve. Market commentary and management’s guidance point to steady service revenue growth (high-margin) and improving profitability. ￼ Valuation gap + analyst upside: Recent analyst coverage still implies meaningful upside — examples include buy ratings / price targets in the $275–$280 range, suggesting \\~35–45% upside from current levels, supported by the fundamentals above and cash returns. If the market re-rates T-Mobile nearer to those comps, upside is substantial. ￼ Numbers that matter (evidence-backed): Record net adds / scale: company reported multi-million postpaid adds in Q3 2025 (e.g., 3,287,000 postpaid phone & other adds referenced in the release / press). These are eye-popping numbers that materially grow revenue base. ￼ Service revenue growth: management reported double-digit growth in postpaid service revenue and mid/high single-digit on overall service revenue in recent quarters. That’s a high-quality revenue stream. ￼ Shareholder returns: $14.6B authorized program through 2026 + dividend increase to $1.02 per quarter (recently declared), both compress available shares and increase yield/total return. ￼ Valuation framework & target: Base case (multiple expansion + FCF growth): If TMUS grows EBITDA modestly and continues buybacks that reduce share count \\~3–5% annually, the market could re-apply a telecom / growth multiple lift (say from mid-teens to low-20s on EV/EBITDA) as growth proves durable. That supports a move into the $250–$300 range over 12–24 months. (Analyst targets cluster near $275–$280.) ￼ Conservative case: Execution slows but FCF and buybacks persist → low-double-digit total return from current price (dividend + modest multiple expansion) — downside limited by cash returns and resilient wireless cash flow. Bull case: Continued share gains, ARPU stability, strong fiber/wireless bundling, and aggressive buybacks drive EPS substantially higher — stock re-rates to premium growth multiple → $300+ possible over 18–36 months.",

The fundamental case of why TMUS can meaningfully appreciate from here Sustained aboveconsensus subscriber growth volume engine TMobile reported record postpaid customer additions in 2025 millions of net adds across postpaid phone other and prepaid from acquisitions with large quarterly adds cited by the company and industry press . Strong net adds drive recurring service revenue ARPU stabilityupside and superior churn economics vs. peers . This growth is the primary revenue engine that will compound cash flows . ￼ 5G leadership and network scale that converts into share gains TMobile built a broad midband 5G footprint faster than peers after the Sprint merger that scale is translating to competitive advantage for coverage performance especially for pricesensitive consumers and suburbanrural areas . Faster cheaper 5G motivates upgrades premium plans 5G broadband and supports new services fixed 5G broadband enterprise customers . Company commentary and analysts emphasize its networkdriven wins . Diversifying revenue broadband fiber tuckins TMobile is not_just phones — they ’ ve added 5G broadband customers and have acquired fiber customers e.g . Metronet acquisitions to scale fixed connectivity offerings . Owning both wireless and fiberfixed broadband increases wallet share per household and improves lifetime value . ￼ Material freecashflow FCF tailwinds aggressive capital returns Management has increased guidance for EBITDA and FCF the company just authorized a large $ 14.6B shareholder return program through 2026 and raised its quarterly dividend — this both reduces share count and returns cash to investors supporting EPS growth and multiple expansion . Buybacks dividend increase are direct catalysts for total return . ￼ Room for margin expansion profit curve operating leverage As service revenue scales faster than incremental capex once major 5G build is complete and as fixed costs are spread over more subscribers EBITDA margins can improve . Market commentary and management ’ s guidance point to steady service revenue growth highmargin and improving profitability . ￼ Valuation gap analyst upside Recent analyst coverage still implies meaningful upside — examples include buy ratings price targets in the $ 275– $ 280 range suggesting 35–45 % upside from current levels supported by the fundamentals above and cash returns . If the market rerates TMobile nearer to those comps upside is substantial . ￼ Numbers that matter evidencebacked Record net adds scale company reported multimillion postpaid adds in Q3 2025 e.g . 3287000 postpaid phone other adds referenced in the release press . These are eyepopping numbers that materially grow revenue base . ￼ Service revenue growth management reported doubledigit growth in postpaid service revenue and midhigh singledigit on overall service revenue in recent quarters . That ’ s a highquality revenue stream . ￼ Shareholder returns $ 14.6B authorized program through 2026 dividend increase to $ 1.02 per quarter recently declared both compress available shares and increase yieldtotal return . ￼ Valuation framework target Base case multiple expansion FCF growth If TMUS grows EBITDA modestly and continues buybacks that reduce share count 3–5 % annually the market could reapply a telecom growth multiple lift say from midteens to low20s on EVEBITDA as growth proves durable . That supports a move into the $ 250– $ 300 range over 12–24 months . Analyst targets cluster near $ 275– $ 280 . ￼ Conservative case Execution slows but FCF and buybacks persist → lowdoubledigit total return from current price dividend modest multiple expansion — downside limited by cash returns and resilient wireless cash flow .

      "selftext": "So I’ve been investing on margin on Robinhood and my account is up like 70% all time (around $49k now). I honestly don’t know if I actually did something smart or if I just got lucky and the market carried me. I make around $10k a month so in theory I can handle drops and put more money in if things go bad, but I’m also pretty much fully using my margin right now so I know that could bite me if the market dips hard. I’m just trying to figure out a couple things: 1. Is it smart to keep using margin since I can afford to deal with dips, or should I back off before I get wrecked? 2. If I sell stuff I bought on margin, do I still get taxed on the gains the same way? (I think yes but not 100% sure.) 3. Anyone here actually use margin long term? How do you know when you’re using too much? Not trying to blow myself up but I also don’t wanna pull back too early if using some leverage is fine. Just curious what people who’ve been through this think.",

      "selftext": "There is a strong consensus right now for a \"Soft Landing.\" I wanted to stress-test this, so I pulled the latest Fed Economic Projections (Median Rate) and Tech Investment data to look for statistical anomalies. I found two massive divergences that suggest the risk is much higher than priced. **1. The \"Volcker\" Tail Risk (The Bear Case)** Looking at the tail risks in the Fed Funds Rate data, my model flagged a **\"Stagflation Shock\" scenario** with a **12% probability** (based on >2-sigma moves). * **The Trigger:** Core PCE re-accelerating to 4.5%+. * **The Historical Analog:** The **1979-1980 Volcker Pivot**. * **The Transmission Logic:** Usually, high rates tighten financial conditions via housing and credit spreads. We see this happening in the \"Credit and housing transmission\" channel (mortgage rates cooling demand). **2. The \"Nominal\" Trap (The Bull Case)** However, Tech Hardware Investment is completely ignoring this signal. It triggered a **\"Red Flag\" for Nominal vs. Real Divergence.** * **The Issue:** We are seeing a surge in nominal spend, but historically (2000-2020), hardware prices *fall* due to hedonic adjustments. The \"Real\" capacity addition might be lower than the dollar amount suggests. * **Concentration Risk:** The top 10 firms now account for **\\~40%** of this entire category. This isn't a broad recovery; it's a concentrated bet by hyperscalers that is insensitive to interest rates. **The Conclusion** We have a \"Two-Speed Economy.\" The Fed is hitting the brakes (Housing/Credit), but the \"Corporate profit margins → capex acceleration\" loop in Tech is hitting the gas. If that 12% Stagflation scenario plays out, the Fed can't cut. If they can't cut, the Tech valuation multiple (which assumes falling discount rates) is at risk. **Visuals:** I've attached the \"Shock Scenario\" and \"Red Flag\" cards below so you can see the risk breakdown. [* **Discussion:** Is anyone hedging for a 1979-style pivot? Or is the productivity gain from this capex enough to kill the inflation pressure?",

      "selftext_processed": "There is a strong consensus right now for a Soft Landing . I wanted to stresstest this so I pulled the latest Fed Economic Projections Median Rate and Tech Investment data to look for statistical anomalies . I found two massive divergences that suggest the risk is much higher than priced . 1 . The Volcker Tail Risk The Bear Case Looking at the tail risks in the Fed Funds Rate data my model flagged a Stagflation Shock scenario with a 12 % probability based on 2sigma moves . The Trigger Core PCE reaccelerating to 4.5 % . The Historical Analog The 19791980 Volcker Pivot . The Transmission Logic Usually high rates tighten financial conditions via housing and credit spreads . We see this happening in the Credit and housing transmission channel mortgage rates cooling demand . 2 . The Nominal Trap The Bull Case However Tech Hardware Investment is completely ignoring this signal . It triggered a Red Flag for Nominal vs. Real Divergence . The Issue We are seeing a surge in nominal spend but historically 20002020 hardware prices fall due to hedonic adjustments . The Real capacity addition might be lower than the dollar amount suggests . Concentration Risk The top 10 firms now account for 40 % of this entire category . This isnt a broad recovery its a concentrated bet by hyperscalers that is insensitive to interest rates . The Conclusion We have a TwoSpeed Economy . The Fed is hitting the brakes HousingCredit but the Corporate profit margins → capex acceleration loop in Tech is hitting the gas . If that 12 % Stagflation scenario plays out the Fed cant cut . If they cant cut the Tech valuation multiple which assumes falling discount rates is at risk . Visuals Ive attached the Shock Scenario and Red Flag cards below so you can see the risk breakdown . Discussion Is anyone hedging for a 1979style pivot Or is the productivity gain from this capex enough to kill the inflation pressure"

      "selftext": "Currently SGOV has a 3.82% 30 day SEC yield. Since we just had a rate cut I expect that number to go down slightly over the next month. Looking into 2026, the consensus is that there is going to be at least 1 fed rate cut. High Yield Savings Accounts usually drop in the same way that the Fed funds rate drops. With one cut, that would bring top HYSAs to 3.25% APY. But, according to AI: Forecast for 91-day (3-month) Treasury yields shows: ~3.64% in Jan 2026 ~3.11% by Mar 2026 ~2.69% by Apr ~2.16% by Jun ~1.95% by Jul Does this mean we will be seeing SGOV yielding 2% by July even though the fed funds rate is stable with likely only one more cut? With typical savings accounts, they usually fall by the same percentage as the fed funds rate, but it appears that SGOV would fall by more than a percent more. Is that because unlike savings accounts, treasuries are tied to the yield curve?",

      "selftext": "I came across this today and saw that JPMorgan has increased its stake in PRS REIT up to 7.58% and it made me think of how it went from roughly 7.01% to 7.58%, and the filing is said to have came out because they crossed a reporting line, seeing at how Tradfi players adding to a housing focused REIT in this kind of market, made me think seriously on what actually they are seeing that the rest of us might not be seeing, Is it just the appeal of steady rental income or are they still seeing strength in the uk housing demand even with everything going on. And what really got my attention is the pace of the accumulation, because to me it doesnt look like speculative grab at all, it feels more like a slow and confident additions from a traditional institution that is sticking to what they know it works, looking like just the kind of those moves that usually reflects a deeper conviction even if it does not come out in the filing. On a side note, i realized alot of talks about how tradfi and crypto are trying to blend over time, now that bitget is trying to expand more into TradFi, so it made me curious what people here can say regarding that, because to me if exchanges start bringing more traditional financial options into their platforms i have these few questions that i would like to know, is that going to be useful for more tokenized assets? Better market data? Or is there something completely different? And I am genuinely interested to know what would make a TradFi meeting crypto setup worth using.",

And what really got my attention is the pace of the accumulation because to me it doesnt look like speculative grab at all it feels more like a slow and confident additions from a traditional institution that is sticking to what they know it works looking like just the kind of those moves that usually reflects a deeper conviction even if it does not_come out in the filing . On a side note i realized alot of talks about how tradfi and crypto are trying to blend over time now that bitget is trying to expand more into TradFi so it made me curious what people here can say regarding that because to me if exchanges start bringing more traditional financial options into their platforms i have these few questions that i would like to know is that going to be useful for more tokenized assets Better market data Or is there something completely different And I am genuinely interested to know what would make a TradFi meeting crypto setup worth using ."

      "title": "What if we redesigned the stock market from scratch to limit market maker power without killing liquidity?",
      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking about this from first principles instead of trying to “patch” today’s system. The current market gives market makers far more influence than just providing liquidity. That power comes from continuous trading, speed advantages, spread control, and real-time visibility into order flow. If you remove any one of those, they adapt. So the question isn’t “how do we punish MMs,” it’s “how do we architect a market where they can only do the job they’re supposed to do.” Here’s what a cleaner, fairer market would actually look like mechanically. First, get rid of continuous time. Replace it with short batch auctions every few seconds. All orders submitted during the interval clear at a single price. This instantly kills latency arbitrage, quote stuffing, and microsecond front-running. Speed stops being a weapon. Price competition replaces reaction time. Second, make order intake blind during each batch. No visible book, no stop inference, no cancel-replace signaling. Only aggregate imbalance exists internally until the batch clears. This removes psychological and informational exploitation while still allowing real supply and demand to determine price. Third, crowd sets the price first. Market makers do not quote prices. They do not step ahead. The clearing price comes purely from matching public buy and sell intent. Only if there is leftover imbalance do MMs step in, and only at the already-determined clearing price. They act as buffers, not drivers. Fourth, change how MMs get paid. No spread capture. No pinning incentives. Instead, they receive a fixed liquidity fee per share absorbed, plus a volatility-adjusted risk stipend when imbalances are large. They are compensated for absorbing risk, not for slowing price discovery or farming chop. Fifth, hard caps on inventory and leverage. Market makers cannot accumulate directional exposure. They must neutralize inventory within defined windows. This prevents them from quietly becoming hedge funds while still letting them stabilize the market when needed. Sixth, separate and slow the options market structurally. Options clear in longer batches. Hedging references prior clears, not instant ticks. This dramatically reduces gamma pinning and “max pain” dynamics that distort the underlying. Seventh, retail execution becomes predictable. Everyone in the batch gets the same price. Worst-case slippage is known in advance. Orders either fill cleanly or don’t fill at all. You still take risk, but you’re not punished for being slower than an algorithm. Finally, stress is handled honestly. When volatility spikes, batch intervals automatically widen and MM obligations loosen. Liquidity is allowed to thin in a controlled way instead of vanishing suddenly and causing flash crashes. Compared to today, the difference is stark. Right now, markets reward speed, opacity, leverage, and time-based exploitation. In this design, markets reward conviction, patience, and real supply-demand alignment. Market makers still exist, but their power is capped by architecture, not by trust or regulation. You don’t eliminate intermediaries. You remove their ability to dominate price. Curious how people here would poke holes in this or improve it.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking about this from first principles instead of trying to “patch” today’s system. The current market gives market makers far more influence than just providing liquidity. That power comes from continuous trading, speed advantages, spread control, and real-time visibility into order flow. If you remove any one of those, they adapt. So the question isn’t “how do we punish MMs,” it’s “how do we architect a market where they can only do the job they’re supposed to do.” Here’s what a cleaner, fairer market would actually look like mechanically. First, get rid of continuous time. Replace it with short batch auctions every few seconds. All orders submitted during the interval clear at a single price. This instantly kills latency arbitrage, quote stuffing, and microsecond front-running. Speed stops being a weapon. Price competition replaces reaction time. Second, make order intake blind during each batch. No visible book, no stop inference, no cancel-replace signaling. Only aggregate imbalance exists internally until the batch clears. This removes psychological and informational exploitation while still allowing real supply and demand to determine price. Third, crowd sets the price first. Market makers do not quote prices. They do not step ahead. The clearing price comes purely from matching public buy and sell intent. Only if there is leftover imbalance do MMs step in, and only at the already-determined clearing price. They act as buffers, not drivers. Fourth, change how MMs get paid. No spread capture. No pinning incentives. Instead, they receive a fixed liquidity fee per share absorbed, plus a volatility-adjusted risk stipend when imbalances are large. They are compensated for absorbing risk, not for slowing price discovery or farming chop. Fifth, hard caps on inventory and leverage. Market makers cannot accumulate directional exposure. They must neutralize inventory within defined windows. This prevents them from quietly becoming hedge funds while still letting them stabilize the market when needed. Sixth, separate and slow the options market structurally. Options clear in longer batches. Hedging references prior clears, not instant ticks. This dramatically reduces gamma pinning and “max pain” dynamics that distort the underlying. Seventh, retail execution becomes predictable. Everyone in the batch gets the same price. Worst-case slippage is known in advance. Orders either fill cleanly or don’t fill at all. You still take risk, but you’re not punished for being slower than an algorithm. Finally, stress is handled honestly. When volatility spikes, batch intervals automatically widen and MM obligations loosen. Liquidity is allowed to thin in a controlled way instead of vanishing suddenly and causing flash crashes. Compared to today, the difference is stark. Right now, markets reward speed, opacity, leverage, and time-based exploitation. In this design, markets reward conviction, patience, and real supply-demand alignment. Market makers still exist, but their power is capped by architecture, not by trust or regulation. You don’t eliminate intermediaries. You remove their ability to dominate price. Curious how people here would poke holes in this or improve it.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been thinking about this from first principles instead of trying to “ patch ” today ’ s system . The current market gives market makers far more influence than just providing liquidity . That power comes from continuous trading speed advantages spread control and realtime visibility into order flow . If you remove any one of those they adapt . So the question isn ’ t “ how do we punish MMs ” it ’ s “ how do we architect a market where they can only do the job they ’ re supposed to do. ” Here ’ s what a cleaner fairer market would actually look like mechanically . First get rid of continuous time . Replace it with short batch auctions every few seconds . All orders submitted during the interval clear at a single price . This instantly kills latency arbitrage quote stuffing and microsecond frontrunning . Speed stops being a weapon . Price competition replaces reaction time . Second make order intake blind during each batch . No_visible book no_stop inference no_cancelreplace signaling . Only aggregate imbalance exists internally until the batch clears . This removes psychological and informational exploitation while still allowing real supply and demand to determine price . Third crowd sets the price first . Market makers do not_quote prices . They do not_step ahead . The clearing price comes purely from matching public buy and sell intent . Only if there is leftover imbalance do MMs step in and only at the alreadydetermined clearing price . They act as buffers not_drivers . Fourth change how MMs get paid . No_spread capture . No_pinning incentives . Instead they receive a fixed liquidity fee per share absorbed plus a volatilityadjusted risk stipend when imbalances are large . They are compensated for absorbing risk not_for slowing price discovery or farming chop . Fifth hard caps on inventory and leverage . Market makers can not accumulate directional exposure . They must neutralize inventory within defined windows . This prevents them from quietly becoming hedge funds while still letting them stabilize the market when needed . Sixth separate and slow the options market structurally . Options clear in longer batches . Hedging references prior clears not_instant ticks . This dramatically reduces gamma pinning and “ max pain ” dynamics that distort the underlying . Seventh retail execution becomes predictable . Everyone in the batch gets the same price . Worstcase slippage is known in advance . Orders either fill cleanly or don ’ t fill at all . You still take risk but you ’ re not_punished for being slower than an algorithm . Finally stress is handled honestly . When volatility spikes batch intervals automatically widen and MM obligations loosen . Liquidity is allowed to thin in a controlled way instead of vanishing suddenly and causing flash crashes . Compared to today the difference is stark . Right now markets reward speed opacity leverage and timebased exploitation . In this design markets reward conviction patience and real supplydemand alignment . Market makers still exist but their power is capped by architecture not_by trust or regulation . You don ’ t eliminate intermediaries . You remove their ability to dominate price . Curious how people here would poke holes in this or improve it ."

We are conditioned to believe US equities always bounce back and keep compounding. But history shows that long flat or negative decades do happen even in major developed markets. Japan is the clearest example. From 1990 to 2010 the Nikkei 225 delivered an annualized return of about minus 4.5 percent. That was not a short downturn. It was two full decades where buy and hold did not work the way people expected. Apollo’s argument is largely valuation driven. When forward price to earnings ratios are elevated future returns tend to compress. The data shows a strong relationship between starting valuation and ten year outcomes and at current levels that math points toward very low returns. Thoughts??",

      "selftext": "Oracle (ORCL) has declined roughly 15% over the past two sessions despite reporting continued strength in cloud infrastructure growth. The market reaction appears less related to demand and more to capital intensity and timing. Oracle is investing heavily in AI-focused data center capacity to support customers such as OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia. While backlog and bookings are strong, near-term free cash flow has turned negative as capital expenditures accelerate, and management has guided that meaningful returns may take several years to materialize. This raises a broader question about AI-related equities, particularly within the NASDAQ: * Is the market beginning to reprice AI investments based on cash flow timing rather than long-term demand? * Does Oracle represent a long-term opportunity once spending normalizes, or is the stock likely to remain range-bound until free cash flow improves? * More broadly, could this signal increased scrutiny across AI-heavy companies with elevated capital requirements? For those interested, here are two perspectives I found useful for context: * Barron’s discussion of Oracle’s balance sheet and credit risk - [Oracle Stock Slumps. Why Its ‘CDS’ Are Spooking Investors. - Barron's]( * Baptista Research's analysis outlining both the bullish and bearish cases for Oracle’s AI strategy - [ I am interested in how others here are thinking about AI exposure within the NASDAQ given recent price action and valuation levels.",

      "selftext": "Global capital is already beginning to shift the US cut interest rates as expected by 25 basis points so one shoe has already dropped now we wait for the other one and the other shoe is Japan According to the information released so far next week around the 18th to 19th the Bank of Japan will very likely announce a rate hike after 30 years they may finally raise rates above 0 point 5 percent to around 0 point 75 once Japan raises rates global capital flows will start to change and global assets will go through a new round of reallocation Why is that Japan has kept ultra low interest rates for decades so investors borrowed yen and moved the money into higher yielding US assets to earn the spread the yen carry trade at its peak reached around 5 trillion dollars but now the two countries are moving in opposite directions one cutting rates one raising them so the interest rate spread will quickly shrink or even disappear to avoid losses carry traders will rush to unwind selling US stocks US bonds and other dollar assets converting to yen and sending funds back to Japan We cannot predict long term trends but in the short term exchange rates will definitely swing sharply the dollar will weaken the yen will continue to strengthen and the US will almost certainly keep cutting rates next year according to their own statements current rates are still at the upper end of the neutral range meaning still a bit too high and very likely to be cut again in Q1 next year Morgan Stanley even predicts that by Q1 of 2026 USD JPY could fall to 140 a big move from the current level above 150 these currency swings will directly affect exports a weaker dollar boosts the competitiveness of US goods while a stronger yen makes Japanese goods more expensive increasing pressure on Japan’s export sector History may sound familiar in the 1980s this is how the US weakened Japans once dominant Made in Japan manufacturing of course that is a bit of a joke but the next asset likely to be hit hard is US Treasuries foreign investors hold about 35 percent of all outstanding Treasuries if carry trade funds exit the US there will be large scale selling prices will fall yields will rise and since Treasuries are the anchor of global asset pricing higher yields mean global risk free benchmark rates will rise pushing financing and debt issuance costs higher around the world Capital always seeks opportunity if it cannot earn carry here it will look elsewhere so investors will search for new safe haven or arbitrage opportunities leading to another round of major global asset reallocation That is the situation if you currently hold US dollars US Treasuries or yen denominated assets you can adjust accordingly but remember to hedge your risks and allocate in stages",

      "selftext": "Jerome Powell, the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has overseen a de facto restart of quantitative easing (QE) through the implementation of \"Reserve Management Purchases\" (RMPs) as of December 12, 2025. While the Fed has officially ceased quantitative tightening (QT) and avoids the term \"QE,\" these purchases of short-term Treasury bills have the effect of expanding the balance sheet and injecting liquidity into the financial system to address recent market strains. How QE Benefits Stocks: Lower Interest Rates: The central bank buys government bonds, increasing demand and pushing yields down; this makes fixed-income investments less attractive compared to stocks. Portfolio Rebalancing: Investors sell their bonds to the central bank and reinvest that money into stocks, increasing demand and prices. Economic Stimulus: QE aims to stimulate growth, leading companies to expand, borrow more cheaply, and potentially increase profits, which boosts stock valuations. Increased Liquidity: More money in the financial system encourages risk-taking, driving capital into equity markets.",

      "selftext": "What do you think is more common - people panic selling because they see their paper losses and their mind just can't intuitively process it ... or people panic selling because they are overexposed, overleveraged, nearing retirement, i.e. have actual *reasoning* for needing the money? I understand the latter, that part makes sense to me. You may very well *need* this money and are not willing to be flexible with your current lifestyle (i.e. push the retirement goalposts) to accommodate the current situation. Understood. But if you're not in that latter bucket, let's assume you don't *need* the money that you're pulling out of the market. No upcoming large purchases, no retirement on the near horizon, etc. So what exactly are these people doing once they liquidate? Watching it sit in a savings account knowing it is now \"safe\" from further paper losses, even though they just guaranteed losses by selling? This is the part of investing that I find extremely interesting - without logical/just reasoning for actually *needing* the money (highly subjective of course) is it not just 100% human psychology and fear of the unknown at that point which drives the panic sale? I realize there are probably speculatory fears such as \"what if this time it's different?\" and \"what if we enter a 15-year recession?\" Are the people who panic sell not proactively mentally prepared for those thoughts? I am currently reading The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel, after having just read The Simple Path to Wealth by J.L. Collins. I was a college Psychology major and the more involved I become with investing the more I am realizing just how psychological the whole thing really is. It seems like 95% of it is man vs. himself. It's truly fascinating. Would love to hear from someone who had major confidence in the strength of their 'investing mind' who was then truly tested by something like the 2008 crash, and how you personally reacted both mentally and physically.",

      "selftext_processed": "What do you think is more common people panic selling because they see their paper losses and their mind just cant intuitively process it ... or people panic selling because they are overexposed overleveraged nearing retirement i.e . have actual reasoning for needing the money I understand the latter that part makes sense to me . You may very well need this money and are not_willing to be flexible with your current lifestyle i.e . push the retirement goalposts to accommodate the current situation . Understood . But if youre not_in that latter bucket lets assume you dont need the money that youre pulling out of the market . No_upcoming large purchases no_retirement on the near horizon etc . So what exactly are these people doing once they liquidate Watching it sit in a savings account knowing it is now safe from further paper losses even though they just guaranteed losses by selling This is the part of investing that I find extremely interesting without logicaljust reasoning for actually needing the money highly subjective of course is it not_just 100 % human psychology and fear of the unknown at that point which drives the panic sale I realize there are probably speculatory fears such as what if this time its different and what if we enter a 15year recession Are the people who panic sell not_proactively mentally prepared for those thoughts I am currently reading The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel after having just read The Simple Path to Wealth by J.L . Collins . I was a college Psychology major and the more involved I become with investing the more I am realizing just how psychological the whole thing really is . It seems like 95 % of it is man vs. himself . Its truly fascinating . Would love to hear from someone who had major confidence in the strength of their investing mind who was then truly tested by something like the 2008 crash and how you personally reacted both mentally and physically ."

      "title": "KRMN: The Pick-and-Shovel Space Play",
      "selftext": "# TL;DR Here’s the whole thesis: If you believe space launches will increase, if you expect NASA, commercial satellite operators, national-security agencies, and private launch companies to keep expanding activity into orbit, then KRMN is a little-known company you *need* to know. ================================= # The Short & Sweet Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is a little-known **aerospace and defense** company posting numbers that look nothing like the obscurity of its stock. Revenue up 23% YoY, net income up 191%, and a funded backlog up 35%, with guidance calling for another year *(and beyond)* of **double-digit expansion**. For a company most of you haven’t even heard of, these are eye-popping metrics. The driver is straightforward: Karman builds high-spec structures, subsystems, and assemblies for **missiles, hypersonics, and next-gen launch vehicles**. Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–high-temperature alloys, for materials used in **strategic missile programs** where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive. That move pushed Karman deeper into **classified supply chains** tied to U.S. rearmament, allied purchases, and the global shift toward tactical missile systems. Karman also sits inside both of the next-decade launch platforms: **Blue Origin’s New Glenn and ULA’s Vulcan**. Each is designed for national security, deep-space, and commercial missions. And since Karman supplies structural components to *both* vehicles, you don’t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst. **Karman wins either way**. Karman’s core markets (missile defense, hypersonics, and launch systems) are expanding, not contracting. That makes its recent pullback attractive. **Takeaway:** Karman is a company that sits inside every major missile and launch trend, and that trend will just accelerate. ================================= What fueled **KRMN's 189% run** since its IPO on February 13? # The Long & Winding Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is an under-the-radar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. **space and missile-defense programs**. But before we talk about what this company actually *does*, we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings. After all, **numbers don’t care about narratives**. They don’t hype. They simply record the truth, especially the kind most people don't pay attention to. Karman’s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual. A company whose trajectory doesn’t match its obscurity. **Growth hiding behind small-cap camouflage**. # The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small, the numbers don’t lie. They signal momentum, and momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental. # FY2024: A Record Across the Board On April 8, 2025, KRMN reported: * **Revenue**: $345.3M, **+23% YoY** * **Net income**: $12.7M, **+191.3% YoY** * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $106.1M, **+29.7% YoY** * **Funded backlog**: $579.8M, **+35.2% YoY** For a small-cap contractor, these are not ordinary numbers. This is a company stepping into a larger orbit (*get it?*) # 2025 Outlook: Expansion, Not Consolidation For FY2025, Karman expects: * **Revenue**: $423–$433M * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $132–$137M **Double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth**. # Q1 2025: The Trend Continued On May 13, 2025: * **EPS**: $0.05 (vs. $0.02 est.) * **Revenue**: $100.12M, **+20.6% YoY** Guidance reaffirmed. No slowdown. At this point, some of you might realize that even though you’ve never heard of this company, these numbers look interesting. And they are. Because once you peel back the veil, the reason becomes obvious. # The CEO Speaks After delivering the [Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025]( Tony Koblinski, Karman’s Chief Executive Officer, summarized it this way: >“Across numerous key metrics, we achieved record performance in 2024 that **positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond**. >Each of our end markets delivered **double-digit topline growth** and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and **national priorities** in missiles, tactical defense systems, and space and launch systems.” [Karman Space & Defense Full-Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results]( []( Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside **America’s missile defense buildup, hypersonic development race, and next-generation launch ecosystem**. But to understand how deep that goes, we begin with a move that opened new doors. # The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year, Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. (MTI), a company specializing in **ultra-high-temperature refractory alloys** used in strategic missile systems. MTI works with materials such as Tantalum, Zirconium, Niobium, Vanadium, and Molybdenum. These aren’t ordinary metals. They are **engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys**. With this acquisition, Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities, access to high-specification missile programs, **deeper integration into classified supply chains**, increased revenue and EBITDA, and expanded design and manufacturing scope. KRMN reaffirmed that it is not just a supplier, but a *strategic* supplier. # Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles. Why? Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished, global conflicts have continued to drive demand, allies are purchasing next-generation tactical systems, and missile defense is entering a new strategic era. Karman provides the structures, subsystems, and assemblies that make these systems operational. Now, it’s not about whether there’s a war or not. Of course, I don’t want *any* wars. But even in peacetime, **missile defense isn’t slowing down**. It’s accelerating. And now Karman sits closer to the core. # Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highest-temperature, highest-priority arms race on Earth. **Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade**. Every major power is investing, testing, and racing toward Mach-5+ platforms. But **few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses**. Karman is one of them. This segment’s revenue surged thanks to well-funded programs in both development and production, **backed by aggressive government budgets**. Karman’s offerings (propulsion, deployable shrouds, launchers, energetic subsystems) are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems. This is not speculative work. This is strategic infrastructure. # Space and Launch Systems This is **where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge**. Revenue here increased due to Karman’s involvement in two next-generation launch vehicles. # Blue Origin’s New Glenn A heavy-lift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites, space infrastructure, and future deep-space missions. It is still in a development stage. Although, on November 13, 2025, the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time. The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027. Blue Origin’s customer base: * Commercial satellite operators. * Government payloads. * Potential national-security missions. [New Glenn]( is designed to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy. Its reusable first stage, massive payload capacity, and **long-term contract potential with DoD and NASA** make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem. Karman supplies components used in New Glenn’s structures and launch systems. # ULA’s Vulcan A next-generation launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). [Vulcan]( is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV, the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. national-security launches. It has already flown its first successful mission. This rocket is built to serve: * U.S. Space Force. * DoD national-security missions. * Commercial payloads. * NASA deep-space missions. Vulcan is engineered specifically for **National Security Space Launch (NSSL)** contracts: The elite, highest-priority, and highest-specification launches in America’s defense architecture and orbital missions. It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defense-related payloads over the next decade. And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan’s architecture. # Whichever Rocket Wins, Karman Wins This isn’t about picking sides in the rocket race. It isn’t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads, or which timeline slips, or which program accelerates. Karman supplies critical hardware to *both* ULA’s Vulcan and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. Karman’s components run through the veins of *both* launch systems. Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts, Karman wins with it. If national-security payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another, the outcome is the same: **Karman benefits either way**. # Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play. **If you understand this one idea**, the rest of the thesis can open itself to you. **You don’t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade**. You don’t have to choose heads or tails. Because with Karman, **it isn’t about the side of the coin**. **It’s just about the coin being flipped into the air**. **As long as rockets are being launched** (commercial, government, national-security, deep-space, doesn’t matter) **Karman benefits**. The rivalry is irrelevant. **The activity itself is the catalyst**. # The Short-Term Decline Now, yes, Karman, like many other growth names, was bruised over the past few weeks. The stock is down –24.80% since the close on November 3, 2025. Personally, I bought (and keep buying) the dip *gradually*. There was support in the high $50s (Karman has bounced from there, though), and the stock did ride a +23.37% rally in four days (Nov 21-26), so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap. Check the chart. Once it runs, it runs north fast. I did buy a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** for cheap, though. Of course, this one is a cheap, low-risk, high-reward play if it works. Quite simply, the stock can move $10 in a couple of days, and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike, these become multi-baggers. But, again, the main play is for the long-term. You should also know the KRMN play, although great for swings, is mostly meant for the **long term**. This is a **structural story**, not a short-lived trade. # Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23, portfolio manager [Randy Gwirtzman]( of Baron Capital published a Barron’s article highlighting small-cap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential. He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward **companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions**. His focus, however, is on profitability, a key filter, especially when bond yields spike. Karman Holdings popped up on his list. And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could **benefit enormously** in the coming years: **Trump’s Golden Dome plans**. Now, everything in this post has been the backdrop, the scaffolding, the necessary foundation. In my next post, if this DD gets approved/noticed, I’ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself, what it is, why it matters, and why a small, overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly, along with several more developments from KRMN. Have a nice day. ================================= Shares, cost basis $58.99 And a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** (these are cheap risk, high reward, though!) because they were dirt cheap, and I know KRMN can move $7-10 in two or three days. However, the play is long-term.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Here ’ s the whole thesis If you believe space launches will increase if you expect NASA commercial satellite operators nationalsecurity agencies and private launch companies to keep expanding activity into orbit then KRMN is a littleknown company you need to know . The Short Sweet Karman Holdings $ KRMN is a littleknown aerospace and defense company posting numbers that look nothing_like the obscurity of its stock . Revenue up 23 % YoY net income up 191 % and a funded backlog up 35 % with guidance calling for another year and beyond of doubledigit expansion . For a company most of you haven ’ t even heard of these are eyepopping metrics . The driver is straightforward Karman builds highspec structures subsystems and assemblies for missiles hypersonics and nextgen launch vehicles . Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–hightemperature alloys for materials used in strategic missile programs where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive . That move pushed Karman deeper into classified supply chains tied to U.S. rearmament allied purchases and the global shift toward tactical missile systems . Karman also sits inside both of the nextdecade launch platforms Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn and ULA ’ s Vulcan . Each is designed for national security deepspace and commercial missions . And since Karman supplies structural components to both vehicles you don ’ t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst . Karman wins either way . Karman ’ s core markets missile defense hypersonics and launch systems are expanding not_contracting . That makes its recent pullback attractive . Takeaway Karman is a company that sits inside every major missile and launch trend and that trend will just accelerate . What fueled KRMNs 189 % run since its IPO on February 13 The Long Winding Karman Holdings $ KRMN is an undertheradar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. space and missiledefense programs . But before we talk about what this company actually does we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings . After all numbers don ’ t care about narratives . They don ’ t hype . They simply record the truth especially the kind most people dont pay attention to . Karman ’ s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual . A company whose trajectory doesn ’ t match its obscurity . Growth hiding behind smallcap camouflage . The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small the numbers don ’ t lie . They signal momentum and momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental . FY2024 A Record Across the Board On April 8 2025 KRMN reported Revenue $ 345.3M 23 % YoY Net income $ 12.7M 191.3 % YoY Adjusted EBITDA $ 106.1M 29.7 % YoY Funded backlog $ 579.8M 35.2 % YoY For a smallcap contractor these are not_ordinary numbers . This is a company stepping into a larger orbit get it 2025 Outlook Expansion Not_Consolidation For FY2025 Karman expects Revenue $ 423– $ 433M Adjusted EBITDA $ 132– $ 137M Doubledigit growth on top of doubledigit growth . Q1 2025 The Trend Continued On May 13 2025 EPS $ 0.05 vs. $ 0.02 est . Revenue $ 100.12M 20.6 % YoY Guidance reaffirmed . No_slowdown . At this point some of you might realize that even though you ’ ve never_heard of this company these numbers look interesting . And they are . Because once you peel back the veil the reason becomes obvious . The CEO Speaks After delivering the Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025 Tony Koblinski Karman ’ s Chief Executive Officer summarized it this way “ Across numerous key metrics we achieved record performance in 2024 that positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond . Each of our end markets delivered doubledigit topline growth and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and national priorities in missiles tactical defense systems and space and launch systems. ” Karman Space Defense FullFiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside America ’ s missile defense buildup hypersonic development race and nextgeneration launch ecosystem . But to understand how deep that goes we begin with a move that opened new doors . The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. MTI a company specializing in ultrahightemperature refractory alloys used in strategic missile systems . MTI works with materials such as Tantalum Zirconium Niobium Vanadium and Molybdenum . These aren ’ t ordinary metals . They are engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys . With this acquisition Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities access to highspecification missile programs deeper integration into classified supply chains increased revenue and EBITDA and expanded design and manufacturing scope . KRMN reaffirmed that it is not_just a supplier but a strategic supplier . Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles . Why Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished global conflicts have continued to drive demand allies are purchasing nextgeneration tactical systems and missile defense is entering a new strategic era . Karman provides the structures subsystems and assemblies that make these systems operational . Now it ’ s not_about whether there ’ s a war or not_Of course I don ’ t want any wars . But even in peacetime missile defense isn ’ t slowing down . It ’ s accelerating . And now Karman sits closer to the core . Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highesttemperature highestpriority arms race on Earth . Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade . Every major power is investing testing and racing toward Mach5 platforms . But few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses . Karman is one of them . This segment ’ s revenue surged thanks to wellfunded programs in both development and production backed by aggressive government budgets . Karman ’ s offerings propulsion deployable shrouds launchers energetic subsystems are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems . This is not_speculative work . This is strategic infrastructure . Space and Launch Systems This is where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge . Revenue here increased due to Karman ’ s involvement in two nextgeneration launch vehicles . Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn A heavylift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites space infrastructure and future deepspace missions . It is still in a development stage . Although on November 13 2025 the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time . The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027 . Blue Origin ’ s customer base Commercial satellite operators . Government payloads . Potential nationalsecurity missions . New Glenn is designed to compete with SpaceX ’ s Falcon Heavy . Its reusable first stage massive payload capacity and longterm contract potential with DoD and NASA make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem . Karman supplies components used in New Glenn ’ s structures and launch systems . ULA ’ s Vulcan A nextgeneration launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance a joint venture between Boeing BA and Lockheed Martin LMT . Vulcan is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. nationalsecurity launches . It has already flown its first successful mission . This rocket is built to serve U.S. Space Force . DoD nationalsecurity missions . Commercial payloads . NASA deepspace missions . Vulcan is engineered specifically for National Security Space Launch NSSL contracts The elite highestpriority and highestspecification launches in America ’ s defense architecture and orbital missions . It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defenserelated payloads over the next decade . And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan ’ s architecture . Whichever Rocket Wins Karman Wins This isn ’ t about picking sides in the rocket race . It isn ’ t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads or which timeline slips or which program accelerates . Karman supplies critical hardware to both ULA ’ s Vulcan and Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn . Karman ’ s components run through the veins of both launch systems . Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts Karman wins with it . If nationalsecurity payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another the outcome is the same Karman benefits either way . Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play . If you understand this one idea the rest of the thesis can open itself to you . You don ’ t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade . You don ’ t have to choose heads or tails . Because with Karman it isn ’ t about the side of the coin . It ’ s just about the coin being flipped into the air . As long as rockets are being launched commercial government nationalsecurity deepspace doesn ’ t matter Karman benefits . The rivalry is irrelevant . The activity itself is the catalyst . The ShortTerm Decline Now yes Karman like many other growth names was bruised over the past few weeks . The stock is down –24.80 % since the close on November 3 2025 . Personally I bought and keep buying the dip gradually . There was support in the high $ 50s Karman has bounced from there though and the stock did ride a 23.37 % rally in four days Nov 2126 so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap . Check the chart . Once it runs it runs north fast . I did buy a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls for cheap though . Of course this one is a cheap lowrisk highreward play if it works . Quite simply the stock can move $ 10 in a couple of days and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike these become multibaggers . But again the main play is for the longterm . You should also know the KRMN play although great for swings is mostly meant for the long term . This is a structural story not_a shortlived trade . Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23 portfolio manager Randy Gwirtzman of Baron Capital published a Barron ’ s article highlighting smallcap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential . He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions . His focus however is on profitability a key filter especially when bond yields spike . Karman Holdings popped up on his list . And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could benefit enormously in the coming years Trump ’ s Golden Dome plans . Now everything in this post has been the backdrop the scaffolding the necessary foundation . In my next post if this DD gets approvednoticed I ’ ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself what it is why it matters and why a small overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly along with several more developments from KRMN . Have a nice day . Shares cost basis $ 58.99 And a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls these are cheap risk high reward though because they were dirt cheap and I know KRMN can move $ 710 in two or three days . However the play is longterm ."

The AI bubble is the same, except the fishtank has a leak. The AI bubble is worse. The bottom line is money, and the momentum of the USA economy is less discretionary money for an expanding portion of consumers. Who will buy those sweet red roses? \"Business is flush with cash,\" you say? How long? Robots? Competition has caused robots to drop in price. One million robots sold for $1000 is $1 billion. Not $1 trillion. It would take over four billion robots sold at $1000 to equal NVDA market cap. Chips are a component of that $1000. \"NVidia valuation if for data centers,\" you say? To serve who? Businesses selling ads? To who? The 1%? Do you see the math problem? So, let's consider two challenges coming. 1. AI bubble bursts. I have NVDA and INTC as short targets. 2. Japan carry trade unwind. I have TM as a safety hedge. So, my plan is to use gains from price declines in NVDA and INTC using put options to buy call options and shares in TM. The further upside is that TM has growth potential in its core business and as a Japan company it has stock price growth potential from a hyperinflated dollar. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "Oracle basically signed up for something close to a $300 billion long term commitment to support OpenAI’s infrastructure. Most of that is data centers and compute, and the spending comes early while the payoff is way out in the future. That’s why the stock reaction looks rough. This isn’t about doubting AI. It’s about margins getting squeezed and the balance sheet taking the hit before revenue catches up. This kind of buildout is capital heavy, not classic high margin software. Oracle is also going head to head with hyperscalers that already run at massive scale. That raises execution risk. The whole thing only works if OpenAI demand stays strong for years, not quarters. If AI spending cools off at all, Oracle feels it fast because the capex isn’t flexible.",

It ’ s about margins getting squeezed and the balance sheet taking the hit before revenue catches up . This kind of buildout is capital heavy not_classic high margin software . Oracle is also going head to head with hyperscalers that already run at massive scale . That raises execution risk . The whole thing only works if OpenAI demand stays strong for years not_quarters .

The situation: I bought SCHD since I heard it was a good dividend option; the problem is, I didn't buy it in a tax-advantaged account (like a 401K or Roth IRA) and instead bought it in a regular brokerage account. Not the end of the world since it only has about $1K USD dedicated to it, but I heard essentially you just end up paying a lot of taxes on it. I also heard that you really want to try to hold on to stocks for at least a year to avoid higher tax rates, but would it be fine to sell off + tank the short-term cost + reinvest in a better stock of my choice?

      "selftext": "Ok helping a friend out deciding something - this is in the USA. They currently have 100% equity in a rental house. Their purchase price was $132,000 plus around $65,000 worth of upgrades before it turned rental. Call it $200,000 even as their investment in this house. Rental house generates $2500/mo on average as a vacation rental. This does require some effort from him, but not a lot. Say 2-3 hours a week max to maintain the place and keep it ready for guests. Insurance is around $2000 a year, taxes are low. Since there's no mortgage, the only real costs are utilities (electric is very cheap) and insurance ($2000 a year). Taxes are cheap. So they are netting somewhere around $27-28,000 a year. Here's the thing we're trying to figure out: The house has appreciated greatly, from what we can tell, since they bought it 5 years back. Houses that are comparable in the area now sell in the $400,000's. He thinks they can get at least $400k for it, maybe more. There are already several people asking and two offers. This person is a decently learned trader who is up 50% this year on his investments. Their plan would be to take 2/3 of the money and put it in \"safe\" spots, ETF's, bonds, even just keep some in a HYS for a safety net. The other 1/3 would go in a family brokerage account to be used as more active trading capital. I do realize that the market has done great this year but this guy is also showing himself to be a decent trader who has had a few nice wins and is ahead overall since he started getting educated about it all. We figure that even at a very modest return per year of say 7%, that $400,000 would generate $28,000/yr ... is that not better to have the money working that way instead of having it tied up in a property? This property is definitely subject to fire and water issues (western USA) ... nothing yet but it feels very much in the cards. Insurance premiums are also skyrocketing as of late in the area. Is it a smart move to sell?",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Shares of financial services company Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) fell 9.1% in the morning session after the company reported weak operating data for November 2025, showing declines in funded customers and trading volumes. >The report revealed that trading volumes for equities dropped by 37% from the previous month, while options and crypto trading fell by 28% and 12%, respectively. The number of funded customers also decreased, partly due to the removal of about 280,000 low-balance accounts. Adding to the pressure, Connecticut's Department of Consumer Protection recently issued a cease-and-desist order to Robinhood for allegedly conducting unlicensed online gambling operations. In response to the developments, analysts at Bank of America Securities and Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their price forecasts on the stock. >What Is The Market Telling Us >Robinhood’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 60 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. >The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 2.8% on the news that the company announced its entry into the Indonesian market as it agreed to acquire a local brokerage and a digital asset trader. >The U.S. retail brokerage entered into agreements to purchase PT Buana Capital Sekuritas and PT Pedagang Aset Kripto. This move marked Robinhood's entry into Southeast Asia's largest market, which has over 19 million capital market investors and 17 million crypto traders. The expansion was part of the company's broader international growth strategy throughout 2025. The deals were subject to approval by Indonesia's Financial Services Authority, with the company stating completion was expected in the first half of 2026. Investor reaction was optimistic, seeing the move as a significant step to tap into a fast-growing market for both stock and crypto trading. >Robinhood is up 215% since the beginning of the year, but at $124.09 per share, it is still trading 18.6% below its 52-week high of $152.46 from October 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Robinhood’s shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $3,564.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Shares of financial services company Robinhood NASDAQHOOD fell 9.1 % in the morning session after the company reported weak operating data for November 2025 showing declines in funded customers and trading volumes . The report revealed that trading volumes for equities dropped by 37 % from the previous month while options and crypto trading fell by 28 % and 12 % respectively . The number of funded customers also decreased partly due to the removal of about 280000 lowbalance accounts . Adding to the pressure Connecticuts Department of Consumer Protection recently issued a ceaseanddesist order to Robinhood for allegedly conducting unlicensed online gambling operations . In response to the developments analysts at Bank of America Securities and Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their price forecasts on the stock . What Is The Market Telling Us Robinhood ’ s shares are extremely volatile and have had 60 moves greater than 5 % over the last year . In that context today ’ s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not_something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business . The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 2.8 % on the news that the company announced its entry into the Indonesian market as it agreed to acquire a local brokerage and a digital asset trader . The U.S. retail brokerage entered into agreements to purchase PT Buana Capital Sekuritas and PT Pedagang Aset Kripto . This move marked Robinhoods entry into Southeast Asias largest market which has over 19 million capital market investors and 17 million crypto traders . The expansion was part of the companys broader international growth strategy throughout 2025 . The deals were subject to approval by Indonesias Financial Services Authority with the company stating completion was expected in the first half of 2026 . Investor reaction was optimistic seeing the move as a significant step to tap into a fastgrowing market for both stock and crypto trading . Robinhood is up 215 % since the beginning of the year but at $ 124.09 per share it is still trading 18.6 % below its 52week high of $ 152.46 from October 2025 . Investors who bought $ 1000 worth of Robinhood ’ s shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $ 3564 ."

He asked about getting a credit card to buy stocks and I flat out told him not to go into credit card debt to buy any stocks, especially when starting out. Not sure if he would listen to me on that one. I just don’t know if buying a couple pieces of stock is worthwhile if that’s all you can for for a length of time.",

ORCL is -12.5% as I write these words, SP500 is flat. I wonder when the market starts paying attention to the AI capex problem (or is it a real problem at all?). It's a big question given the market's dependence on Mag7 and the AI story in general. At the same time, Fed has already decided to start buying shorter-term Treasury securities and is probably just one step away from a full QE. I wonder if QE makes investors forget about anything else so that the market can tolerate a few quarters of so-so reports (due to surging capex) from tech and keep testing new highs.",

      "selftext": "Hey All, TLDR: MT $70 target book value / fundamental value. Catalysts are huge technical breakout, perfect alignment of fundamentals, and possible gasoline on the fire if the Ukraine war ends, or possible announcements on rare earths like everybody else. They have a lot of mines. I have built a bit of a specialization in steel stocks. Caught the huge run in NUE in 21', the X buyout in '23, and again when it went through among some other trades. I thought I'd share my latest trade idea. Mittal Steel is the largest global steel company outside of China with operations globally. Weekly Chart: Massive breakout and trading at a 12 year high. Global profile in 2nd screen shot. General notes below. 1. MT 1. Target: $70 18X Long Run Earnings conservative, $70.75 Book Value 2. Q EPS Growth: 31.36% 255.75% (14.18%) 86.85% 3. Q REV Growth: 3.03% (1.99%) (9.11%) 1.11% 4. Next Q EPS: 31%, 9%, -5%, 61% 5. Next Q REV: 7%, 3% next two years 6. Catalysts: 7. Technicals 1. Technicals very strong. Trading at a decade high. Huge breakout 2. IWM huge long term breakout 3. Fed QE 4. Long hated stock 8. Fundamentals 1. Probably 2nd best run steel company globally after Steel Dynamics 2. Bought back almost 40% of shares in the last 5 years. Huge ongoing buybacks. 3. USA, EU, Canada Protections and more seem to be coming to keep China steel out. Everywhere MT operates is looking to protect their industry. 4. And over the last four years combined, capital spending amounted to $15.49 billion resulting in $1.9 billion in through cycle EBITDA coming (step change in profitability), Very Cheap, 5. M&A target (BHP, RIO, NUE?), 50% of FCF going to buying back shares. Nearly 40% in the last few years. Nice dividend. 6. China steel exports may or may not be sustainable. Iron ore prices rising. Massive China Stimulus + recovering market. 7. Number 1 global volume outside of China which everybody is putting tariffs on. 8. Trading 1/2 of Revenue, 63% of Book Value 9. Europe waking up. Massive German/Europe Stimulus. Global stimulus. Back to strength globally from trough? Europe Anti dumping cases. 22% USA Profits. 10. Drove at least $3-4 in value taking over Calvert a huge plant when the Nippon deal to acquire U.S. Steel went through. . Strongest price action of all steel companies. New market leader. 9. Catalysts 1. Massive Technical Breakout + Fundamental factors above. 2. If the Ukraine War Ends we will pop massively due to huge steel demand to rebuild. MT has extensive Ukraine and EU assets. 3. Any mention of rare earths it could rocket even if it is a gimmick. Positions",

      "title": "Lyft -8% and Uber -7% as Waymo plans 1M weekly robotaxi rides and a major 2026 city expansion",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving tech unit, expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year, aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan. It’s the first time that the company, which started in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car project, has set a hard target for its business. >Currently, the Mountain View, California-based company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Bay Area communities, Austin, Atlanta and, as of last month, Miami. That’s “a number that we’re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026,” Waymo said in a blog post. “As we look to 2026, we’re laying the early groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including international cities like Tokyo and London.” >Waymo doesn’t share financial data, but various estimates suggest it makes at least $20 per ride, which adds up to more than $20 million a month. At 1 million rides per week, its annualized revenue would hit about $1 billion, a milestone for the early-stage robotaxi market. To handle that volume of rides the company’s fleet will likely expand to at least 10,000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2,500 now, likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar I-Pace SUVs. >Though the service has proved popular with riders, Waymo’s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges. The company’s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco, for example, following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat, a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors. Last month, a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street. Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company, which hasn’t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans, needs to make additional safety upgrades. >Additionally, Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses. >“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s Waymo's chief safety officer, said in a statement. >That said, Waymo’s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space, including General Motors’ Cruise unit, which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco. Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving, is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its so-called Full Self-Driving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use. Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it’s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD. >But while Waymo’s safety issues so far haven’t been as serious, some critics think it’s expanding too fast, perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit. >“We are left to wonder why the \\`world’s most experienced driver’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience,” Phil Koopman, an autonomous driving researcher and Carnegie-Mellon University professor, said in a blog post. “Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can’t shrug off. It’s unclear which will happen first.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Waymo Alphabet Inc. ’ s selfdriving tech unit expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan . It ’ s the first time that the company which started in 2009 as the Google SelfDriving Car project has set a hard target for its business . Currently the Mountain View Californiabased company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix Los Angeles San Francisco and Bay Area communities Austin Atlanta and as of last month Miami . That ’ s “ a number that we ’ re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026 ” Waymo said in a blog post . “ As we look to 2026 we ’ re laying the early groundwork for ridehailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026 including international cities like Tokyo and London. ” Waymo doesn ’ t share financial data but various estimates suggest it makes at least $ 20 per ride which adds up to more than $ 20 million a month . At 1 million rides per week its annualized revenue would hit about $ 1 billion a milestone for the earlystage robotaxi market . To handle that volume of rides the company ’ s fleet will likely expand to at least 10000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2500 now likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar IPace SUVs . Though the service has proved popular with riders Waymo ’ s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges . The company ’ s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco for example following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors . Last month a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street . Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company which hasn ’ t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans needs to make additional safety upgrades . Additionally Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses . “ While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better ” Mauricio Peña Waymo ’ s Waymos chief safety officer said in a statement . That said Waymo ’ s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space including General Motors ’ Cruise unit which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco . Tesla whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its socalled Full SelfDriving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use . Last week the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it ’ s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD . But while Waymo ’ s safety issues so far haven ’ t been as serious some critics think it ’ s expanding too fast perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit . “ We are left to wonder why the world ’ s most experienced driver ’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience ” Phil Koopman an autonomous driving researcher and CarnegieMellon University professor said in a blog post . “ Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can ’ t shrug off . It ’ s unclear which will happen first ."
