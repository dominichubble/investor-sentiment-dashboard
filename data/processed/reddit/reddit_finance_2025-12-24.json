      "selftext": "I’m a US tax resident (NRI from India) trying to understand the **PFIC implications of Indian mutual funds**, and I want to make sure my mental model is correct before I rule them out entirely. From what I understand: * Most **Indian mutual funds** qualify as **PFICs** under US tax law * PFIC taxation can mean: * Punitive tax rates * Interest charges * Complex annual filing (Form 8621) * Even “plain vanilla” equity or index mutual funds in India fall under PFIC rules * ETFs and stocks listed in the US do *not* have this issue My questions: 1. Is it correct that **almost all Indian mutual funds are PFICs**, regardless of fund type? 2. Are there *any* realistic exceptions or structures that avoid PFIC treatment? 3. Do most US NRIs: * Avoid Indian mutual funds entirely? * Use US-domiciled ETFs instead? * Stick to bank products (FDs/RDs) despite lower returns? 4. Practically speaking, is the compliance + tax drag so bad that Indian mutual funds are just not worth it for US taxpayers? I’m not asking for personal tax advice, just looking to validate my understanding and hear how others have approached this trade-off in practice. Thanks in advance!",

      "selftext": "TL;DR: MicroStrategy (MSTR) is trading below the value of it's Bitcoin holdings. Short-term swings are sentiment-driven, but structurally the company is strong, positioned to benefit from the next Bitcoin bull cycle, and supported by growing institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s Slide & Market Factors - Macro risk-off: BTC dropped 30-40% from October highs due to higher rates, tech volatility, and a strong USD. ETF outflows & liquidations: Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $3.4B outflows in Nov 2025; leveraged crypto positions triggered $1B in forced liquidations. Crypto winter: BTC erased much of its YTD gains. When Bitcoin falls, “Bitcoin proxy” stocks like MSTR often fall even more. MSTR = Leveraged Bitcoin Exposure - Bitcoin-driven stock: MSTR amplifies BTC moves up or down. During the recent dip, MSTR dropped faster than BTC. Balance sheet buys: MicroStrategy continues acquiring Bitcoin via stock and debt, giving leverage on BTC rallies while retaining flexibility. Software business: Enterprise analytics platform still grows (Q3 2025 revenue \\~$128.7M, +10.9% YoY; subscription revenue \\~$46M, +65% YoY). Small compared to BTC, but it exists. Bitcoin Holdings & Per-Share Math - Total BTC: 671,268 BTC ($58.4B at $87,049/BTC) 87,000/BTC). Shares outstanding (diluted): \\~312,000,000 BTC per share: 671,268 ÷ 312,000,000 ≈ 0.00215 BTC/share Dollar value per share of BTC: 0.00215 × $87,000 ≈ $187/share MSTR trades at \\~$157.88. Each share represents roughly $187 of Bitcoin value, plus a small, growing software business and cash reserves. Market cap vs BTC holdings: \\~$46B vs \\~$58.4B, trading below implied BTC value. Impact of BTC moves: Every $10,000 rise in BTC adds \\~$21.5/share or \\~$6.7B total to MSTR’s BTC holdings. Why Bitcoin Could Go Up in 2026 - Post-halving cycle dynamics: Last Bitcoin halving was in April 2024. Historically, years 2–3 after a halving are strong bull phases (2012, 2016, 2020). Supply growth slows, while demand continues to increase. Institutional accumulation: Large institutions and corporate treasuries continue quietly buying Bitcoin on dips, adding structural demand. Banks entering crypto services: JPMorgan and other major banks are exploring crypto trading, lending, and custody services. Bitcoin can be used as loan collateral, unlocking liquidity without selling BTC. More institutional access reduces perceived risk, increases adoption, and supports price stability. Macro tailwinds: If the Fed starts cutting rates or inflation eases, risk assets like BTC historically outperform. Global adoption & limited supply: More users, corporations, and payment integration, combined with a capped supply (21M BTC), drives scarcity and potential upside. Why 2026 Could Be Favorable - BTC leverage: If Bitcoin rallies, MSTR (and MSTU) amplifies the move. Balance sheet & capital strategy: They can acquire Bitcoin while managing cash and debt. Software + subscriptions: Small recurring revenue provides a floor outside crypto. Structural advantage: Few public companies combine BTC exposure with access to capital markets. Institutional tailwinds: Banks and other institutions adopting crypto services reduce risk perception and expand demand. Bottom line: MSTR and MSTU are leveraged ways to play Bitcoin with corporate backing. Short-term swings are sentiment-driven, but structurally the company is strong. With historical post-halving trends, institutional accumulation, limited supply, and banks beginning to integrate Bitcoin, 2026 could be a favorable year for BTC — and your MSTU position could amplify those gains. Current positions: 2x leverage MSTR Bull (MSTU) - 2890 units @ $9.92. Continuing to DCA",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR MicroStrategy MSTR is trading below the value of its Bitcoin holdings . Shortterm swings are sentimentdriven but structurally the company is strong positioned to benefit from the next Bitcoin bull cycle and supported by growing institutional adoption . Bitcoin ’ s Slide Market Factors Macro riskoff BTC dropped 3040 % from October highs due to higher rates tech volatility and a strong USD . ETF outflows liquidations Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $ 3.4B outflows in Nov 2025 leveraged crypto positions triggered $ 1B in forced liquidations . Crypto winter BTC erased much of its YTD gains . When Bitcoin falls “ Bitcoin proxy ” stocks like MSTR often fall even more . MSTR Leveraged Bitcoin Exposure Bitcoindriven stock MSTR amplifies BTC moves up or down . During the recent dip MSTR dropped faster than BTC . Balance sheet buys MicroStrategy continues acquiring Bitcoin via stock and debt giving leverage on BTC rallies while retaining flexibility . Software business Enterprise analytics platform still grows Q3 2025 revenue $ 128.7M 10.9 % YoY subscription revenue $ 46M 65 % YoY . Small compared to BTC but it exists . Bitcoin Holdings PerShare Math Total BTC 671268 BTC $ 58.4B at $ 87049BTC 87000BTC . Shares outstanding diluted 312000000 BTC per share 671268 ÷ 312000000 ≈ 0.00215 BTCshare Dollar value per share of BTC 0.00215 × $ 87000 ≈ $ 187share MSTR trades at $ 157.88 . Each share represents roughly $ 187 of Bitcoin value plus a small growing software business and cash reserves . Market cap vs BTC holdings $ 46B vs $ 58.4B trading below implied BTC value . Impact of BTC moves Every $ 10000 rise in BTC adds $ 21.5share or $ 6.7B total to MSTR ’ s BTC holdings . Why Bitcoin Could Go Up in 2026 Posthalving cycle dynamics Last Bitcoin halving was in April 2024 . Historically years 2–3 after a halving are strong bull phases 2012 2016 2020 . Supply growth slows while demand continues to increase . Institutional accumulation Large institutions and corporate treasuries continue quietly buying Bitcoin on dips adding structural demand . Banks entering crypto services JPMorgan and other major banks are exploring crypto trading lending and custody services . Bitcoin can be used as loan collateral unlocking liquidity without selling BTC . More institutional access reduces perceived risk increases adoption and supports price stability . Macro tailwinds If the Fed starts cutting rates or inflation eases risk assets like BTC historically outperform . Global adoption limited supply More users corporations and payment integration combined with a capped supply 21M BTC drives scarcity and potential upside . Why 2026 Could Be Favorable BTC leverage If Bitcoin rallies MSTR and MSTU amplifies the move . Balance sheet capital strategy They can acquire Bitcoin while managing cash and debt . Software subscriptions Small recurring revenue provides a floor outside crypto . Structural advantage Few public companies combine BTC exposure with access to capital markets . Institutional tailwinds Banks and other institutions adopting crypto services reduce risk perception and expand demand . Bottom line MSTR and MSTU are leveraged ways to play Bitcoin with corporate backing . Shortterm swings are sentimentdriven but structurally the company is strong . With historical posthalving trends institutional accumulation limited supply and banks beginning to integrate Bitcoin 2026 could be a favorable year for BTC — and your MSTU position could amplify those gains . Current positions 2x leverage MSTR Bull MSTU 2890 units $ 9.92 . Continuing to DCA"

I would like some level of consistency in income going into 2026 given some prevailing bearish singles (the ai bubble popping). I have around 320k in unvested stock which vests over a period of 4 years. The stock is granted to me monthly and the grants are treated as regular income on my W2 and taxed accordingly. I am interested in using options or other kinds of derivatives to hedge against the volatility of my monthly income. So far I have the vague idea of using some kind of ladder of monthly puts as insurance on any large price drops. I'd like to know if anyone has experience with this sort of thing or to source ideas on it. I've looked at strategies like the following but am interested in other approaches as well. Perhaps other timelines rather than monthly. Maybe LEAPS? Although a temporary price drop can recover which can cause the LEAP to not increase in value due to the long time to expiration. Open to ideas. EDIT: I'm not able to purchase options against my company stock directly so I'm looking into things like puts on QQQ, TQQQ, or VGT.",

      "selftext": "There is a common trap that catches traders every month: The Headline CPI print misses expectations, the market rips, and then fades the entire move by the end of the week. The reason? **CPI creates volatility, but PCE defines the trend.** If you are trading macro events, you need to separate the signal from the noise: * **Trade the CPI release** for immediate intraday volatility (Scalping/Fading). The algo reaction is usually based on the MoM (Month-over-Month) surprise. * **Trade the PCE trend** for position sizing and swing trades. This is the number that actually moves the bond market and sets the discount rate for equities. The most dangerous setup is when Headline CPI drops (bearish USD / bullish Stocks) but Core PCE remains sticky. This is a \"fake out\" signal. The market initially celebrates the CPI drop, but the Fed (and the bond market) ignores it because their preferred gauge hasn't moved. It helps to visualize the \"Gap\" vs the Fed's 2% target to see if the trend is actually breaking or just noise. You can view the live spread between CPI and the Fed's PCE target here: [",

      "selftext": "I’ve been watching Broadcom (AVGO) closely, and it feels like the debate around this stock has quietly shifted. This isn’t really about “is Broadcom a good company?” anymore almost everyone agrees it is. The real question seems to be: Has the market already priced in too much perfection? Here’s where I see the split: Bull case: Strong AI networking + custom silicon exposure Massive backlog with hyperscaler customers Software cash flows (VMware) supporting buybacks and dividends Management with a long track record of execution Bear case: Valuation already assumes sustained AI capex with no hiccups AI related products may pressure margins near term Backlog ≠ guaranteed revenue timing If AI spending cools even slightly, there’s not much valuation cushion What makes AVGO tricky is that it’s not a hype stock it’s a disciplined compounder but it’s now being priced like an AI must-win. So I’m curious how others here think about it: Is AVGO fairly valued given its consistency and cash flow, or Is this one of those names where “great company” ≠ “great entry price” right now? Not trying to push a trade genuinely interested in how long term investors here are framing the risk/reward at these levels.",

The real question seems to be Has the market already priced in too much perfection Here ’ s where I see the split Bull case Strong AI networking custom silicon exposure Massive backlog with hyperscaler customers Software cash flows VMware supporting buybacks and dividends Management with a long track record of execution Bear case Valuation already assumes sustained AI capex with no_hiccups AI related products may pressure margins near term Backlog ≠ guaranteed revenue timing If AI spending cools even slightly there ’ s not_much valuation cushion What makes AVGO tricky is that it ’ s not_a hype stock it ’ s a disciplined compounder but it ’ s now being priced like an AI mustwin . So I ’ m curious how others here think about it Is AVGO fairly valued given its consistency and cash flow or Is this one of those names where “ great company ” ≠ “ great entry price ” right now Not_trying to push a trade genuinely interested in how long term investors here are framing the riskreward at these levels ."

This is a conviction portfolio. I’m 19, I have 60k to invest, and I’m willing to take on risk. I’m not the type to fold under pressure. Even if there are 5 bad years in a row, I’ll stay strong, and if anything, buy more as long as the fundamentals are solid. I want to create the structure of my portfolio and stick to it, and make yearly rebalances. I’m coming here one more time before I officially put my money in, because for me 60k is a lot and it took a hell of a grind to save up. So when I do this, I want to do it right. My ETFs are the backbone of my portfolio. Stable and steady growth is the idea, allowing my money to compound. Next, BTC at 10% makes sense to me. I know it’s a volatile beast, but I’m not selling anytime soon, and I believe it has a solid future over the next decade. I can stomach the swings. Now, my individual picks are where I’ve received the most criticism, since I’ve been told I already have all these picks within my ETFs. I’m aware of this, and I trimmed it down to 15%. My thought process was choosing the companies I have the most faith in regarding their long-term growth to get above-average returns. I know this means I’m doubling down on American growth, and to be frank, I’m okay with that. Next is nuclear. I tried keeping it as small as possible, and I’m still thinking about trimming down URA, but nuclear is a bet I’m willing to take. I could talk for hours about why, but I’ll keep it short: I just think it’s ridiculous that the entry point is cheaper than solar when it has 1000x the potential. I also understand the massive risks, and if it goes to 0, I can stomach it. Overall, what do you guys think? Am I ready? All advice and criticism is welcome.",

This is a conviction portfolio . I ’ m 19 I have 60k to invest and I ’ m willing to take on risk . I ’ m not_the type to fold under pressure . Even if there are 5 bad years in a row I ’ ll stay strong and if anything buy more as long as the fundamentals are solid . I want to create the structure of my portfolio and stick to it and make yearly rebalances . I ’ m coming here one more time before I officially put my money in because for me 60k is a lot and it took a hell of a grind to save up . So when I do this I want to do it right . My ETFs are the backbone of my portfolio . Stable and steady growth is the idea allowing my money to compound . Next BTC at 10 % makes sense to me . I know it ’ s a volatile beast but I ’ m not_selling anytime soon and I believe it has a solid future over the next decade . I can stomach the swings . Now my individual picks are where I ’ ve received the most criticism since I ’ ve been told I already have all these picks within my ETFs . I ’ m aware of this and I trimmed it down to 15 % . My thought process was choosing the companies I have the most faith in regarding their longterm growth to get aboveaverage returns . I know this means I ’ m doubling down on American growth and to be frank I ’ m okay with that . Next is nuclear . I tried keeping it as small as possible and I ’ m still thinking about trimming down URA but nuclear is a bet I ’ m willing to take . I could talk for hours about why but I ’ ll keep it short I just think it ’ s ridiculous that the entry point is cheaper than solar when it has 1000x the potential . I also understand the massive risks and if it goes to 0 I can stomach it . Overall what do you guys think Am I ready All advice and criticism is welcome ."

      "selftext": "Recently I have been delving deeper into Micron Corporation particularly its business situation in terms of the demand for AI-driven memory and high-bandwidth memory (HBM). The management seems very confident, believing that HBM will remain in short supply for a long time to come and the demand for AI data centers has a structural difference from previous memory cycles. After going through a downturn, the prices of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash memory (NAND) seem to be stabilizing. From historical experience, this indicates the beginning of a recovery. Meanwhile the memory industry is always cyclical, and it is difficult to determine how much of this strong trend is truly driven by AI-driven demand and how much is just a normal inventory reduction rebound under supply shortages. For those who are interested in Micron (MU) or the memory market, what do you think are the truly important factors this time? Is it the allocation of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and whether long-term contracts can change the cycle, or do you still mainly focus on price and capacity expansion which were the key factors in previous cycles? I'm curious about how others view the current situation of Micron.",

      "selftext_processed": "Recently I have been delving deeper into Micron Corporation particularly its business situation in terms of the demand for AIdriven memory and highbandwidth memory HBM . The management seems very confident believing that HBM will remain in short supply for a long time to come and the demand for AI data centers has a structural difference from previous memory cycles . After going through a downturn the prices of dynamic random access memory DRAM and flash memory NAND seem to be stabilizing . From historical experience this indicates the beginning of a recovery . Meanwhile the memory industry is always cyclical and it is difficult to determine how much of this strong trend is truly driven by AIdriven demand and how much is just a normal inventory reduction rebound under supply shortages . For those who are interested in Micron MU or the memory market what do you think are the truly important factors this time Is it the allocation of highbandwidth memory HBM and whether longterm contracts can change the cycle or do you still mainly focus on price and capacity expansion which were the key factors in previous cycles Im curious about how others view the current situation of Micron ."

It’s no longer just about chips ,the real opportunity is moving toward power grids, cooling solutions, and massive data center buildouts. The “boring” infrastructure that actually keeps AI running is becoming the core of the trade. The big rotation: Tech valuations are stretched, and that’s setting the stage for a rotation. With rates easing and new policies coming online, long-ignored sectors like banks, industrials, healthcare, and commodities are finally positioned to have their moment.

      "selftext": "It's an age old question, and I'm invested in both. But I wrestle mentally with which is the better choice. Most of the time the comparison isn't apples to apples because RE is often bought with leverage whereas plain equities aren't. Most retail investors aren't managing leverage by rolling futures etc. But what if you want to leverage equities to the same extent as a RE investment, take into account financing terms, depreciation benefits, recapture, taxes, hedging strategies for equities drawdowns, and all the works! Which is the better choice. Here is a summary of such a discussion including assumptions and conclusions. Feel free to double check (easy w LLM) and/or roast the conclusion as much as you want in either direction. LETF (3x) Exposure: $100,000 Leverage cost: 2.5%/yr Dividend: 0.75%/yr Price appreciation: 28%/yr (UPRO) or 40%/yr (TQQQ) Tax rate: 40% short-term capital gains on all gains + 0% tax on dividend for simplicity (can include later) --made it STCG because one would likely need to institute some hedging to prevent catastrophic loss. Duration: 5 years Real Estate Property: $100,000 Down payment: 33% → $33,000 Mortgage: 67% → $67,000 Mortgage interest: 5.5% Accelerated depreciation (MACRS 5-year): assume ~20%/yr Rental income: 6% → $6,000/yr → taxed at 35% → $3,900 net Appreciation: 3% or 5%/yr Depreciation recapture: 25% of total depreciation Duration: 5 years Net Gain 3x LETF (UPRO, 28%) 149,050 3x LETF (TQQQ, 40%) 254,050 Real Estate (3%/yr, accelerated depreciation) 94,000 Includes rental + depreciation − recapture − interest Real Estate (5%/yr) 105,675 Looks like as long as you can manage market downturns, LETFs could possibly provide a better return under these assumptions.

      "selftext_processed": "Its an age old question and Im invested in both . But I wrestle mentally with which is the better choice . Most of the time the comparison isnt apples to apples because RE is often bought with leverage whereas plain equities arent . Most retail investors arent managing leverage by rolling futures etc . But what if you want to leverage equities to the same extent as a RE investment take into account financing terms depreciation benefits recapture taxes hedging strategies for equities drawdowns and all the works Which is the better choice . Here is a summary of such a discussion including assumptions and conclusions . Feel free to double check easy w LLM andor roast the conclusion as much as you want in either direction . LETF 3x Exposure $ 100000 Leverage cost 2.5 % yr Dividend 0.75 % yr Price appreciation 28 % yr UPRO or 40 % yr TQQQ Tax rate 40 % shortterm capital gains on all gains 0 % tax on dividend for simplicity can include later made it STCG because one would likely need to institute some hedging to prevent catastrophic loss . Duration 5 years Real Estate Property $ 100000 Down payment 33 % → $ 33000 Mortgage 67 % → $ 67000 Mortgage interest 5.5 % Accelerated depreciation MACRS 5year assume 20 % yr Rental income 6 % → $ 6000yr → taxed at 35 % → $ 3900 net Appreciation 3 % or 5 % yr Depreciation recapture 25 % of total depreciation Duration 5 years Net Gain 3x LETF UPRO 28 % 149050 3x LETF TQQQ 40 % 254050 Real Estate 3 % yr accelerated depreciation 94000 Includes rental depreciation − recapture − interest Real Estate 5 % yr 105675 Looks like as long as you can manage market downturns LETFs could possibly provide a better return under these assumptions .

      "selftext": "The upward trend from the low point is very impressive, having already completed three upward waves, and is only missing a small fifth wave, followed by a 1-2 retracement. The overall structure is still incomplete. First, it must break through the strong resistance level of 102 with high volume. Secondly, to confirm the continued upward trend, it needs to break through 116. As I've said before, it generally follows Nvidia; NBIS is like a leveraged stock of Nvidia, and it surges whenever NVDA rises This rocket stock has more than doubled in less than a month from its low point. Next, I think the focus will shift to the AI ​​sector, and this rocket stock will take a break. NVDA is the most stable, NBIS is more aggressive, and AVGO is also a good option. AVGO already has a small leading diagonal pattern, and it should undergo a small second wave tonight before starting a larger upward trend",

A lot of people in the market aren’t super bullish on Intel, but it’s worth noting that the U.S. government agreed to put around $8.9 billion into the company at the end of August. If Intel executes well strategically, I think the next earnings report could be a major turning point. What do you guys think?",

So in this case I set a certain amount, lets say $2k. I split the amount in 3 parts and enter on red days within 1-2 weeks. In some cases if I see that stock it not doing well for 6-8 months, I may relocate funds to other similar stock with good fundamentals but may slightly oversold. I don't always follow my own rules, though. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it hurts 😁",

So in this case I set a certain amount lets say $ 2k . I split the amount in 3 parts and enter on red days within 12 weeks . In some cases if I see that stock it not_doing well for 68 months I may relocate funds to other similar stock with good fundamentals but may slightly oversold . I dont always follow my own rules though . Sometimes it helps sometimes it hurts 😁"

Google says: Explanation of the Spike Technical Glitch: Several financial data platforms reportedly misidentified the 'INFY' ticker, potentially confusing automated trading systems and triggering aggressive, self-reinforcing buy orders. Short Squeeze: Market analysts suggested a major lender recalled a large number of Infosys ADR shares lent to short sellers. The sudden, forced buying to cover these positions in a thinly traded market drove the price up sharply. Low Liquidity: The event occurred on a Friday during the holiday period when many institutional traders were absent, amplifying the impact of the automated buying and share recalls on the price. Key Takeaways Fundamentals Unchanged: Infosys issued a formal clarification to the stock exchanges stating there were no material events or corporate announcements that would justify the price movement, confirming the company's fundamentals remained stable. Domestic Market Disconnect: The price surge was isolated to the U.S. market. The company's shares on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India closed with only a modest gain of 0.7% on the same day, reinforcing the notion that the ADR spike was an isolated anomaly. Regulatory Scrutiny: The incident has highlighted vulnerabilities in ADR trading mechanisms and data integrity, prompting demand for market scrutiny from the NYSE and SEC. Then why infy adr declining??",

What infy adr spike said Was it technical glitch Was it Pump Dump just guessing Google says Explanation of the Spike Technical Glitch Several financial data platforms reportedly misidentified the INFY ticker potentially confusing automated trading systems and triggering aggressive selfreinforcing buy orders . Short Squeeze Market analysts suggested a major lender recalled a large number of Infosys ADR shares lent to short sellers . The sudden forced buying to cover these positions in a thinly traded market drove the price up sharply . Low Liquidity The event occurred on a Friday during the holiday period when many institutional traders were absent amplifying the impact of the automated buying and share recalls on the price . Key Takeaways Fundamentals Unchanged Infosys issued a formal clarification to the stock exchanges stating there were no_material events or corporate announcements that would justify the price movement confirming the companys fundamentals remained stable . Domestic Market Disconnect The price surge was isolated to the U.S. market . The companys shares on the National Stock Exchange NSE in India closed with only a modest gain of 0.7 % on the same day reinforcing the notion that the ADR spike was an isolated anomaly . Regulatory Scrutiny The incident has highlighted vulnerabilities in ADR trading mechanisms and data integrity prompting demand for market scrutiny from the NYSE and SEC . Then why infy adr declining"

      "selftext": "One of the primary arguments against Uber as an investment can be summarized in two words: AV disruption. As an Uber investor, it probably goes without saying, but I disagree and I’m going to show you why. The bear case usually boils down to two hypothetical scenarios: 1. **The “In-House” Threat:** AV companies keep their trip sourcing exclusive to their own apps to maximize profits. 2. **The “Squeeze” Threat:** As AV companies scale and costs come down they will require higher margins and won’t accept Uber’s take rates. I am going to address both of these, but let’s start with the crux of the point two: Uber’s Take Rate. # Understanding Uber’s Take Rates and the Impact of AVs The argument goes like this: As AV companies like Waymo, Tesla, and Zoox scale, the power dynamic of the ride-share industry will shift. The fleet owner-operators, in order to earn a payback on their capex investments, will require a larger share of the pie. They will reject the \\~30% mobility take rate that Uber currently enjoys. In essence, they will push Uber’s take rate down to 20% or lower, eating away at the cash generation and profitability Uber is currently experiencing, and in turn, jeopardizing the investment thesis. At a surface level, this is a valid concern. A drop in take rates from 30% to 20% looks like it would have a significant impact on Uber’s growth prospects. But Uber’s financials tell a complicated story: **not all revenue dollars are created equal.** When you dig into the unit economics, Uber’s top line is artificially inflated by “pass-through” costs. I don’t think many investors are aware of this, so I am going to break it down. The bottom line is this: A 20% AV take rate isn’t necessarily a negative impact. In fact, it might be a more profitable outcome for the company - a tailwind. # The “Cloudy” 30%: The Human Ride Uber’s Q3 Mobility reporting reflects a headline take rate of \\~30%. Take rate is defined as Revenue / Mobility Gross Bookings. It is the revenue Uber generates after paying drivers. The thing is, a significant portion of the reported revenue is a pass-through. It isn’t money that Uber keeps. A huge chunk of every fare you see in the top-line revenue isn't revenue at all, it’s an **insurance premium.** Uber’s financials reflect this insurance premium as revenue (which inflates the headline Take Rate), but they have to immediately set it aside in a \"loss reserve\" provision to pay for future accidents. The money comes in as top line revenue but is immediately removed in the “other” line of Cost of Revenue. Add in the driver incentives required to pay human drivers during peak hours and the “real” revenue is even smaller. Q3 Mobility Revenue of $7.6b turns into a mobility adjusted EBITDA of $2.04b. That is a gap of $5.6b lost to insurance and incentives… the majority of which doesn’t exist in Uber provided AV rides. # The “Clean” 20%: AV Rides Now, let’s look at the economics of AV rides. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has noted that AV partners should be open to an 80/20 revenue split, stating in a recent interview: []( \"…any player should take that 80% \\[revenue split\\], because the benefits of utilization more than pay for themselves. So, economically, we're sitting in a very, very good place.\" While that headline number (20%) is lower than the current 30% mobility take rate, the cost structure is very different. 1. **No Insurance Liability:** The AV fleet owner (Waymo, etc.) carries the insurance on the asset. Uber’s “Cost of Revenue” for insurance drops to zero. 2. **No Driver Incentives:** You don’t need to pay an AV a bonus to drive in peak hours. So, while Uber takes a smaller portion of gross bookings, they keep a larger portion of the profit. # The Prove Out I ran the numbers to compare a standard “Human Scenario” to a theoretical “AV Scenario” based on actuals pulled directly from Uber’s Q3’25 filings. To ensure a margin of safety, I used conservative assumptions. I estimated insurance costs at 28% of Uber’s revenue, and driver incentives at another 23%. These estimates are grounded in the $1.02B year-over-year jump in the \"Other\" cost line item (where insurance lives). In reality, Uber provisioned over $2.08B for insurance reserves in the first 9 months of 2025 alone, meaning my model likely underestimates how much money Uber loses on insurance. I ran two models: 1. **Conservative Model:** Adjusts only for insurance. 2. **Realistic “Less Conservative” Model:** Adjusts for both insurance and driver incentives and includes accounting for support fees etc. **The results:** A 20% \"clean\" take rate from an AV ride-share is equal to or more profitable than a 30% \"cloudy\" take rate from a human. * In the **Human Scenario**, despite the 30% take rate, the “Real Net Revenue” (what’s left after insurance, incentives, and processing) is roughly **$2.37 per ride**. * In the **AV Scenario**, with a 20% take rate, the “Real Net Revenue” jumps to **$3.90 per ride**. **That is a \\~65% increase in profit per ride.** # The Utilization Arbitrage A 20% take rate implies that for an AV partner to voluntarily accept 80 cents on the dollar, they need to generate at least 25% more rides than they could on their own to break even in the deal. I am confident Uber is capable of delivering and data is already reflecting that. In a recent earnings call, management revealed that Waymo vehicles operating on the Uber network in Austin and Atlanta were “**more productive than 99% of human drivers.**” When you plug an AV into Uber’s demand network it becomes the most utilized vehicle on the platform. Uber’s service isn't as simple as matching riders to drivers, it is a complex logistical challenge. This is the value of Uber’s Marketplace Liquidity**.** Uber has 10 years of historical data and proprietary algorithms that allow it to predict demand spikes before they happen. Uber has the unique ability to optimize trips, providing AV cars with high-margin routes while offloading complex edge-cases to the human drivers. Without Uber, a standalone AV fleet faces a major mathematical hurdle: Uber estimates that “**in a typical large city, a fixed (AV) fleet designed to meet the weekly peak will have up to 95% of vehicles idle during the multiple weekly troughs**.” Uber’s platform provides access to demand driven by **189 million monthly active customers** and can maximize AV utilization. **If Uber increases fleet ridership by just 25%, which I am confident they can, the partner maximizes the return on their massive hardware investments.** This isn’t even taking into account the massive overhead of operating an AV fleet. Look at the cost structure of a standalone AV business. Today, the pure operating cost of an AV is estimated to be **>$2.00 per mile**, which is comparable to the total cost of a human-driven ride, **before spending any money on customer acquisition.** Standalone operators face \"Demand Generation\" costs that can run into the **billions annually**. Uber has already done this. By partnering with Uber, AV operators pay a fee (20% take rate) for the elimination of this massive cost. # The Aggregator Thesis: Fragmentation While social media and the market focus on a debate about who will win the AV market, Waymo or Tesla, I believe they are missing the most likely outcome: **fragmentation**. My thesis is simple: **AV hardware will be a commodity.** In 10 years, autonomous vehicles will simply be commoditized car seats fighting for utilization. Whether the car is built by Tesla, Waymo, or Zoox won't matter to the rider. The only thing that matters to riders is **liquidity** \\- who can provide a ride in 3 minutes for the lowest/most reasonable price? The answer is Uber. Uber isn’t going to be disrupted by the AV - it is going to aggregate it. # Strategically Supporting Fragmentation Uber wants a fragmented market. If one AV player dominates the market (a highly unlikely \"Winner Take All\" scenario for Waymo ), that provider gains pricing power over Uber. But if the market fragments into a dozen competing AV providers (Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, Tesla, Nuro, and others) Uber becomes the best in class marketplace to list on - access to the largest rider pool matters most. This is why Uber is strategically partnering with everyone to help increase competition and market fragmentation. The recent Nuro partnership is a perfect example. Morgan Stanley estimates that US AV miles driven will grow at a **103% CAGR** through 2032. But what is more important for Uber, is that MS expects the supply to become fragmented. Now, I am not arguing there is no risk. The report also assumes that as AV hardware scales, the apps will fragment too, leaving Uber with a smaller slice of the growing AV rideshare pie. Morgan Stanley projects that Uber could capture just **22% of US AV trips** in 2032, with Waymo and Tesla capturing the bulk of the volume on their own apps. This is not an unreasonable assumption, I fully expect that even Uber AV partners will offer their rides via in-house apps as well. **But context matters**. This 22% share reflects the new and growing AV segment of ride-shares and does not account for Uber’s human-driver market. Even if Uber only gains 22% of the market, the overall TAM is growing and any market share of the **lower-cost of revenue** AV market, coupled with their core human drivers, is a net positive growth opportunity, not a existential crisis. Even so, I believe the 22% projection to be a bear-case scenario and that AV hardware companies will see the benefit in outsourcing their logistics and customer acquisition costs to Uber and benefiting from Uber’s increased utilization. Uber is intentionally lowering the barrier to entry for AV companies to ensure no single fleet operator gains leverage. Dara Khosrowshahi has been explicit about this strategy, repeatedly mentioning using \"Uber’s balance sheet\" to support AV partners. This is proactive and defensive capital allocation**.** Uber is effectively acting as a funding source to prop up a fragmented supply base and it’s working. I am not arguing there is no AV risk. There certainly is. The next 1-3 years will be the defining period for this thesis. Uber must successfully onboard multiple competing fleets to maintain its liquidity moat. But if they do, the specific robotaxi brand won’t matter. Access to fast and cost-efficient rides is all that matters to the consumer. I’ll go as far as saying that riders eventually wont care if their ride is from a human or an AV, and they won’t mind paying an extra $1 per mile in exchange for fast and reliable transportation that Uber provides. # In Conclusion Uber isn’t going to be disrupted by AVs; it’s going to aggregate them. By trading “cloudy” high-take-rate mobility revenue for “clean” asset-light AV revenue, they are positioned to benefit from the increasing role of AV ride-sharing. **And we didn’t even touch on the impact to Uber Eats.** As Josh Brown (of Ritholtz Wealth and The Compound) points out, we are currently paying humans to transport burritos in 4,000lb machines, an absurd model. The shift to small-scale AV robots (like the Nuro and Serve Robotics partnerships Uber is rolling out) solves this inefficiency. Removing the human driver and the vehicle from the food delivery equation transforms the unit economics of the entire delivery segment. The growth of AV services provides Uber the ability to automate inefficiencies and cut back its largest costs - wages and insurance for human drivers. AVs are a tailwind for Uber, not a major threat and the market refuses to accept that. **Disclosure**: I hold Uber stock. I am long Uber and have been adding on any weakness in share price. [](",

      "selftext_processed": "One of the primary arguments against Uber as an investment can be summarized in two words AV disruption . As an Uber investor it probably goes without saying but I disagree and I ’ m going to show you why . The bear case usually boils down to two hypothetical scenarios 1 . The “ InHouse ” Threat AV companies keep their trip sourcing exclusive to their own apps to maximize profits . 2 . The “ Squeeze ” Threat As AV companies scale and costs come down they will require higher margins and won ’ t accept Uber ’ s take rates . I am going to address both of these but let ’ s start with the crux of the point two Uber ’ s Take Rate . Understanding Uber ’ s Take Rates and the Impact of AVs The argument goes like this As AV companies like Waymo Tesla and Zoox scale the power dynamic of the rideshare industry will shift . The fleet owneroperators in order to earn a payback on their capex investments will require a larger share of the pie . They will reject the 30 % mobility take rate that Uber currently enjoys . In essence they will push Uber ’ s take rate down to 20 % or lower eating away at the cash generation and profitability Uber is currently experiencing and in turn jeopardizing the investment thesis . At a surface level this is a valid concern . A drop in take rates from 30 % to 20 % looks like it would have a significant impact on Uber ’ s growth prospects . But Uber ’ s financials tell a complicated story not all revenue dollars are created equal . When you dig into the unit economics Uber ’ s top line is artificially inflated by “ passthrough ” costs . I don ’ t think many investors are aware of this so I am going to break it down . The bottom line is this A 20 % AV take rate isn ’ t necessarily a negative impact . In fact it might be a more profitable outcome for the company a tailwind . The “ Cloudy ” 30 % The Human Ride Uber ’ s Q3 Mobility reporting reflects a headline take rate of 30 % . Take rate is defined as Revenue Mobility Gross Bookings . It is the revenue Uber generates after paying drivers . The thing is a significant portion of the reported revenue is a passthrough . It isn ’ t money that Uber keeps . A huge chunk of every fare you see in the topline revenue isnt revenue at all it ’ s an insurance premium . Uber ’ s financials reflect this insurance premium as revenue which inflates the headline Take Rate but they have to immediately set it aside in a loss reserve provision to pay for future accidents . The money comes in as top line revenue but is immediately removed in the “ other ” line of Cost of Revenue . Add in the driver incentives required to pay human drivers during peak hours and the “ real ” revenue is even smaller . Q3 Mobility Revenue of $ 7.6b turns into a mobility adjusted EBITDA of $ 2.04b . That is a gap of $ 5.6b lost to insurance and incentives… the majority of which doesn ’ t exist in Uber provided AV rides . The “ Clean ” 20 % AV Rides Now let ’ s look at the economics of AV rides . CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has noted that AV partners should be open to an 8020 revenue split stating in a recent interview …any player should take that 80 % revenue split because the benefits of utilization more than pay for themselves . So economically were sitting in a very very good place . While that headline number 20 % is lower than the current 30 % mobility take rate the cost structure is very different . 1 . No Insurance Liability The AV fleet owner Waymo etc . carries the insurance on the asset . Uber ’ s “ Cost of Revenue ” for insurance drops to zero . 2 . No Driver Incentives You don ’ t need to pay an AV a bonus to drive in peak hours . So while Uber takes a smaller portion of gross bookings they keep a larger portion of the profit . The Prove Out I ran the numbers to compare a standard “ Human Scenario ” to a theoretical “ AV Scenario ” based on actuals pulled directly from Uber ’ s Q3 ’ 25 filings . To ensure a margin of safety I used conservative assumptions . I estimated insurance costs at 28 % of Uber ’ s revenue and driver incentives at another 23 % . These estimates are grounded in the $ 1.02B yearoveryear jump in the Other cost line item where insurance lives . In reality Uber provisioned over $ 2.08B for insurance reserves in the first 9 months of 2025 alone meaning my model likely underestimates how much money Uber loses on insurance . I ran two models 1 . Conservative Model Adjusts only for insurance . 2 . Realistic “ Less Conservative ” Model Adjusts for both insurance and driver incentives and includes accounting for support fees etc . The results A 20 % clean take rate from an AV rideshare is equal to or more profitable than a 30 % cloudy take rate from a human . In the Human Scenario despite the 30 % take rate the “ Real Net Revenue ” what ’ s left after insurance incentives and processing is roughly $ 2.37 per ride . In the AV Scenario with a 20 % take rate the “ Real Net Revenue ” jumps to $ 3.90 per ride . That is a 65 % increase in profit per ride . The Utilization Arbitrage A 20 % take rate implies that for an AV partner to voluntarily accept 80 cents on the dollar they need to generate at least 25 % more rides than they could on their own to break even in the deal . I am confident Uber is capable of delivering and data is already reflecting that . In a recent earnings call management revealed that Waymo vehicles operating on the Uber network in Austin and Atlanta were “ more productive than 99 % of human drivers. ” When you plug an AV into Uber ’ s demand network it becomes the most utilized vehicle on the platform . Uber ’ s service isnt as simple as matching riders to drivers it is a complex logistical challenge . This is the value of Uber ’ s Marketplace Liquidity . Uber has 10 years of historical data and proprietary algorithms that allow it to predict demand spikes before they happen . Uber has the unique ability to optimize trips providing AV cars with highmargin routes while offloading complex edgecases to the human drivers . Without Uber a standalone AV fleet faces a major mathematical hurdle Uber estimates that “ in a typical large city a fixed AV fleet designed to meet the weekly peak will have up to 95 % of vehicles idle during the multiple weekly troughs. ” Uber ’ s platform provides access to demand driven by 189 million monthly active customers and can maximize AV utilization . If Uber increases fleet ridership by just 25 % which I am confident they can the partner maximizes the return on their massive hardware investments . This isn ’ t even taking into account the massive overhead of operating an AV fleet . Look at the cost structure of a standalone AV business . Today the pure operating cost of an AV is estimated to be $ 2.00 per mile which is comparable to the total cost of a humandriven ride before spending any money on customer acquisition . Standalone operators face Demand Generation costs that can run into the billions annually . Uber has already done this . By partnering with Uber AV operators pay a fee 20 % take rate for the elimination of this massive cost . The Aggregator Thesis Fragmentation While social media and the market focus on a debate about who will win the AV market Waymo or Tesla I believe they are missing the most likely outcome fragmentation . My thesis is simple AV hardware will be a commodity . In 10 years autonomous vehicles will simply be commoditized car seats fighting for utilization . Whether the car is built by Tesla Waymo or Zoox wont matter to the rider . The only thing that matters to riders is liquidity who can provide a ride in 3 minutes for the lowestmost reasonable price The answer is Uber . Uber isn ’ t going to be disrupted by the AV it is going to aggregate it . Strategically Supporting Fragmentation Uber wants a fragmented market . If one AV player dominates the market a highly unlikely Winner Take All scenario for Waymo that provider gains pricing power over Uber . But if the market fragments into a dozen competing AV providers Waymo Cruise Zoox Tesla Nuro and others Uber becomes the best in class marketplace to list on access to the largest rider pool matters most . This is why Uber is strategically partnering with everyone to help increase competition and market fragmentation . The recent Nuro partnership is a perfect example . Morgan Stanley estimates that US AV miles driven will grow at a 103 % CAGR through 2032 . But what is more important for Uber is that MS expects the supply to become fragmented . Now I am not_arguing there is no_risk . The report also assumes that as AV hardware scales the apps will fragment too leaving Uber with a smaller slice of the growing AV rideshare pie . Morgan Stanley projects that Uber could capture just 22 % of US AV trips in 2032 with Waymo and Tesla capturing the bulk of the volume on their own apps . This is not_an unreasonable assumption I fully expect that even Uber AV partners will offer their rides via inhouse apps as well . But context matters . This 22 % share reflects the new and growing AV segment of rideshares and does not_account for Uber ’ s humandriver market . Even if Uber only gains 22 % of the market the overall TAM is growing and any market share of the lowercost of revenue AV market coupled with their core human drivers is a net positive growth opportunity not_a existential crisis . Even so I believe the 22 % projection to be a bearcase scenario and that AV hardware companies will see the benefit in outsourcing their logistics and customer acquisition costs to Uber and benefiting from Uber ’ s increased utilization . Uber is intentionally lowering the barrier to entry for AV companies to ensure no_single fleet operator gains leverage . Dara Khosrowshahi has been explicit about this strategy repeatedly mentioning using Uber ’ s balance sheet to support AV partners . This is proactive and defensive capital allocation . Uber is effectively acting as a funding source to prop up a fragmented supply base and it ’ s working . I am not_arguing there is no_AV risk . There certainly is . The next 13 years will be the defining period for this thesis . Uber must successfully onboard multiple competing fleets to maintain its liquidity moat . But if they do the specific robotaxi brand won ’ t matter . Access to fast and costefficient rides is all that matters to the consumer . I ’ ll go as far as saying that riders eventually wont care if their ride is from a human or an AV and they won ’ t mind paying an extra $ 1 per mile in exchange for fast and reliable transportation that Uber provides . In Conclusion Uber isn ’ t going to be disrupted by AVs it ’ s going to aggregate them . By trading “ cloudy ” hightakerate mobility revenue for “ clean ” assetlight AV revenue they are positioned to benefit from the increasing role of AV ridesharing . And we didn ’ t even touch on the impact to Uber Eats . As Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth and The Compound points out we are currently paying humans to transport burritos in 4000lb machines an absurd model . The shift to smallscale AV robots like the Nuro and Serve Robotics partnerships Uber is rolling out solves this inefficiency . Removing the human driver and the vehicle from the food delivery equation transforms the unit economics of the entire delivery segment . The growth of AV services provides Uber the ability to automate inefficiencies and cut back its largest costs wages and insurance for human drivers . AVs are a tailwind for Uber not_a major threat and the market refuses to accept that . Disclosure I hold Uber stock . I am long Uber and have been adding on any weakness in share price ."

      "title": "Private credit markets are experiencing turmoil: Apollo is shifting to a defensive stance, and why is this a warning sign?",
      "selftext": "Global asset management giant Apollo is shifting to a defensive stance, adopting a series of strategies to address current market challenges. Apollo CEO Mark Rowan stated that the company's top priority is building the strongest possible balance sheet to ensure it is well-positioned to weather significant challenges in credit and equity markets. To this end, Apollo has taken three key measures: accumulating substantial cash reserves, deleveraging, and selling off high-risk debt assets. The rationale behind Apollo strategic shift lies in currently inflated asset prices, the unlikelihood of a significant long-term interest rate drop, and escalating geopolitical risks. Against this backdrop, Apollo has moved from aggressive investment to a conservative, defensive approach. First, Apollo has cleaned up its balance sheet, shifting to a \"cash is king\" model, reducing its exposure to AI-related loans and CIO risks, lowering leverage, and increasing interest rate hedging. These measures are setting a benchmark for the entire industry. This shift is not only Apollo response but also reflects the dual impact of deteriorating fundamentals and wavering confidence facing the private credit market. For example, last week, another large private equity firm, Blue Owl Capital, withdrew a $10 billion financing project due to risk concerns. Meanwhile, share prices of funds including KKR and BlackRock have plummeted, and bad debts have surged, indicating serious challenges in the credit market. Apollo defensive measures are being taken against the backdrop of a potential reckoning in the private credit industry. Mark Rowan has said that if you see one cockroach in the private credit market, it means there are likely more, suggesting he believes there is widespread systemic risk in the market. Despite the S&P 500 index rising nearly 15 percentage points this year, share prices of companies like FSKKR Capital and BlackRock's BDC have fallen sharply, and bad debt rates have surged. Competitors like Blue Owl Capital are still trying to address liquidity issues through mergers and acquisitions, but panic over valuation mismatches and redemption pressure is spreading in the market. In contrast, Apollo strategy of cleaning house early and accumulating cash reserves seems to be stockpiling resources for the coming economic downturn. Faced with this uncertain market environment, Apollo's conservative strategy appears particularly prudent and wise. As investors, we must maintain respect for the market at all times. With the end of the year approaching, allocating more funds to US Treasury bonds might be a good option for weathering the current economic climate, as US Treasury bonds are still considered a relatively safe investment in the current economic environment.",

      "selftext_processed": "Global asset management giant Apollo is shifting to a defensive stance adopting a series of strategies to address current market challenges . Apollo CEO Mark Rowan stated that the companys top priority is building the strongest possible balance sheet to ensure it is wellpositioned to weather significant challenges in credit and equity markets . To this end Apollo has taken three key measures accumulating substantial cash reserves deleveraging and selling off highrisk debt assets . The rationale behind Apollo strategic shift lies in currently inflated asset prices the unlikelihood of a significant longterm interest rate drop and escalating geopolitical risks . Against this backdrop Apollo has moved from aggressive investment to a conservative defensive approach . First Apollo has cleaned up its balance sheet shifting to a cash is king model reducing its exposure to AIrelated loans and CIO risks lowering leverage and increasing interest rate hedging . These measures are setting a benchmark for the entire industry . This shift is not_only Apollo response but also reflects the dual impact of deteriorating fundamentals and wavering confidence facing the private credit market . For example last week another large private equity firm Blue Owl Capital withdrew a $ 10 billion financing project due to risk concerns . Meanwhile share prices of funds including KKR and BlackRock have plummeted and bad debts have surged indicating serious challenges in the credit market . Apollo defensive measures are being taken against the backdrop of a potential reckoning in the private credit industry . Mark Rowan has said that if you see one cockroach in the private credit market it means there are likely more suggesting he believes there is widespread systemic risk in the market . Despite the SP 500 index rising nearly 15 percentage points this year share prices of companies like FSKKR Capital and BlackRocks BDC have fallen sharply and bad debt rates have surged . Competitors like Blue Owl Capital are still trying to address liquidity issues through mergers and acquisitions but panic over valuation mismatches and redemption pressure is spreading in the market . In contrast Apollo strategy of cleaning house early and accumulating cash reserves seems to be stockpiling resources for the coming economic downturn . Faced with this uncertain market environment Apollos conservative strategy appears particularly prudent and wise . As investors we must maintain respect for the market at all times . With the end of the year approaching allocating more funds to US Treasury bonds might be a good option for weathering the current economic climate as US Treasury bonds are still considered a relatively safe investment in the current economic environment ."

      "selftext": "Since going public in 2021, Rocket Lab (RKLB) has seen its stock rise from around $10 to over $70 by 2025, representing a +600% return for early investors. However, it was 2025 that truly marked a turning point for the company. Over the year, Rocket Lab completed 21 successful launches of its Electron rocket, achieving a 100% success rate a critical milestone in the launch services industry. Following its final launch on December 21 (deploying the Japanese iQPS radar satellite), the stock rose by roughly 8%, approaching its recent highs around $77 per share (current price). In December 2025 alone, RKLB gained nearly 17%, driven by strong operational execution and growing expectations for 2026, particularly around the development of the Neutron rocket, designed for heavier payloads. I personally looked into using leverage via futures on tokenized versions of the stock through Bitget Onchain, but only large-cap names like NVDAon (NVIDIA), TSLAon (Tesla), and AAPLon were available. Rocket Lab is increasingly positioning itself as a credible challenger to SpaceX in the small satellite launch segment, supported by a growing backlog and expanding defense contracts. A key milestone was the $805 million contract awarded by the Space Development Agency (SDA) the largest in Rocket Lab’s history. According to Koontz, securing a contract of this scale reflects strong government confidence and suggests Rocket Lab could play a long-term role in U.S. space programs. From a strategic perspective, Rocket Lab benefits from deep vertical integration, controlling much of the value chain from manufacturing to launch services, while strengthening partnerships with institutional players such as NASA. These factors contribute to a durable competitive advantage against emerging rivals and position the company as a long-term beneficiary of both commercial and government-driven growth in the space economy. Personally, if Rocket Lab continues executing at this pace, I believe RKLB could still deliver attractive returns into 2026. That said, I’m open to opposing views feel free to comment if there are risks or negative factors I may be overlooking.",

      "selftext": "I have been paying attention to the artificial intelligence market recently and found that the impact of artificial intelligence on the U.S. economy is becoming more and more significant. Artificial intelligence investment continues to accumulate growth, and in the next few years, it may become a more important growth driver and key indicator. The influence of artificial intelligence is becoming more and more obvious. Although not all growth is due to artificial intelligence, its marginal effect is already quite significant, and its influence is penetrating into various industries, daily life, commerce, health care, transportation, education and industrial automation. Although the labor market has begun to weaken, it seems to be more like a normal adjustment of the employment market and a sign of the change of the times. Given that the artificial intelligence industry is dominated by a few key companies, even if there is a setback after overheating, the Bank of America also believes that its potential threats to the economy - including the impact on consumers and unemployment risks - are quite limited. Does this indicate that a new normal is coming? Why?",

Artificial intelligence investment continues to accumulate growth and in the next few years it may become a more important growth driver and key indicator . The influence of artificial intelligence is becoming more and more obvious . Although not_all growth is due to artificial intelligence its marginal effect is already quite significant and its influence is penetrating into various industries daily life commerce health care transportation education and industrial automation . Although the labor market has begun to weaken it seems to be more like a normal adjustment of the employment market and a sign of the change of the times . Given that the artificial intelligence industry is dominated by a few key companies even if there is a setback after overheating the Bank of America also believes that its potential threats to the economy including the impact on consumers and unemployment risks are quite limited . Does this indicate that a new normal is coming Why"

      "selftext": "Following a robust performance in 2025, market sentiment widely anticipates this momentum will carry into 2026, with investors generally optimistic about further upside potential. Yet beneath this optimism, several factors warrant close attention. Valuations Hit Record Highs The S&P 500's valuation has surpassed the peak reached during the dot com bubble, reaching unprecedented levels. While the technology sector has been the primary driver, such elevated valuations raise concerns about the sustainability of the bull market. We are experiencing repeated volatility, and although high valuations pose resistance, these hurdles are not insurmountable if fundamentals remain strong. Earnings Expectations Remain Elevated Global markets widely anticipate double digit earnings growth, particularly pronounced in emerging markets. Yet current valuations already fully reflect these optimistic projections, setting the bar exceptionally high. Risks are most pronounced in the technology sector, especially concerning artificial intelligence investments and their expected returns. Sector Rotation: New Focus As the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors show signs of slowing, we are witnessing a rotation of capital toward defensive or cyclical stocks. This trend may persist into 2026 as investors reassess sector fundamentals. With technology stocks losing weight, cyclical industries and stagflation resistant sectors are gaining attention, while the upcoming earnings season may trigger further sector adjustments. Seasonal Risk Appetite and Active Stock Selection While seasonal risk appetite typically boosts equities early in the year, January and February historically rank among the weakest months for stocks. As S&P 500 correlations decline, active stock selection will grow increasingly vital in 2026, creating opportunities for stock pickers to outperform the market. Market Sentiment Current market positions are crowded, with investors brimming with confidence in equities, commodities, and economic growth. Yet the greatest risk remains the U.S. labor market and its potential to reignite recession fears. While markets currently price in only a low probability of recession, setbacks in AI development could emerge as the next major micro risk for U.S. equities. How do you view the market outlook for 2026? Will you remain committed to technology stocks, or are you adjusting your allocation to other sectors?",

      "selftext_processed": "Following a robust performance in 2025 market sentiment widely anticipates this momentum will carry into 2026 with investors generally optimistic about further upside potential . Yet beneath this optimism several factors warrant close attention . Valuations Hit Record Highs The SP 500s valuation has surpassed the peak reached during the dot com bubble reaching unprecedented levels . While the technology sector has been the primary driver such elevated valuations raise concerns about the sustainability of the bull market . We are experiencing repeated volatility and although high valuations pose resistance these hurdles are not_insurmountable if fundamentals remain strong . Earnings Expectations Remain Elevated Global markets widely anticipate double digit earnings growth particularly pronounced in emerging markets . Yet current valuations already fully reflect these optimistic projections setting the bar exceptionally high . Risks are most pronounced in the technology sector especially concerning artificial intelligence investments and their expected returns . Sector Rotation New Focus As the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors show signs of slowing we are witnessing a rotation of capital toward defensive or cyclical stocks . This trend may persist into 2026 as investors reassess sector fundamentals . With technology stocks losing weight cyclical industries and stagflation resistant sectors are gaining attention while the upcoming earnings season may trigger further sector adjustments . Seasonal Risk Appetite and Active Stock Selection While seasonal risk appetite typically boosts equities early in the year January and February historically rank among the weakest months for stocks . As SP 500 correlations decline active stock selection will grow increasingly vital in 2026 creating opportunities for stock pickers to outperform the market . Market Sentiment Current market positions are crowded with investors brimming with confidence in equities commodities and economic growth . Yet the greatest risk remains the U.S. labor market and its potential to reignite recession fears . While markets currently price in only a low probability of recession setbacks in AI development could emerge as the next major micro risk for U.S. equities . How do you view the market outlook for 2026 Will you remain committed to technology stocks or are you adjusting your allocation to other sectors"

      "selftext": "Nike closed around 57 dollars, sitting near multi-year lows after a sharp post-earnings selloff. The stock is now down more than 30% from its 52-week highs, significantly underperforming both the broader market and other consumer discretionary names. From a short-term trading perspective, this level is starting to matter. Most of the recent selling appears event-driven, and price is now consolidating near prior support. Momentum is still weak, but downside pressure looks slower compared to the initial drop. This is not a long-term thesis. Demand and margin concerns remain. But at current levels, the risk reward for a technical bounce is becoming clearer, especially if the broader market stays stable. I’m watching closely rather than rushing in. What do others think, short-term bounce here or still falling?",

Following the data release, Treasury yields rose sharply while stock indices opened slightly lower. Tech stocks broadly declined. Market expectations now project the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice in 2026 (down from three previous projections). This is a fascinating phenomenon! Ordinary people I've spoken with universally feel this year's economic conditions are poor, with employment and daily life proving challenging. Yet economic data, stock markets, and various asset performances all appear unrealistically strong. The devil is in the details. Data indicates that increased consumption by high income households was the primary driver of GDP growth (with substantially higher investment income being a key factor), while low and middle income families face hardships due to tariffs, employment pressures, and rising prices. Large corporations' massive investments in sectors like AI have boosted economic growth, yet small and medium sized enterprises continue to struggle. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the government shutdown will reduce fourth quarter GDP. I'd like to hear what opportunities everyone has identified and is sharing. Given the current situation, should we hold stocks through the holidays or lock in profits? Should we start planning ahead for next year?",

Market expectations now project the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice in 2026 down from three previous projections . This is a fascinating phenomenon Ordinary people Ive spoken with universally feel this years economic conditions are poor with employment and daily life proving challenging . Yet economic data stock markets and various asset performances all appear unrealistically strong . The devil is in the details . Data indicates that increased consumption by high income households was the primary driver of GDP growth with substantially higher investment income being a key factor while low and middle income families face hardships due to tariffs employment pressures and rising prices . Large corporations massive investments in sectors like AI have boosted economic growth yet small and medium sized enterprises continue to struggle . The Congressional Budget Office projects that the government shutdown will reduce fourth quarter GDP . Id like to hear what opportunities everyone has identified and is sharing . Given the current situation should we hold stocks through the holidays or lock in profits Should we start planning ahead for next year"

      "title": "What is Value Investing? (VI according to Graham & Buffet)",
      "selftext": "**Hey everybody,** The stock market is like an ant nest with its own departments, each with their problems and own struggles. It is impossible to grasp the whole nest/market. To navigate through this jungle, you can use different methods and strategies. You can buy meme stocks, you can pump and dump cryp\\*o, you can 100x leverage on an option and get 100 likes because you lost your house and now live in a car. Today our focus is \"**drum roll**\" Value Investing. **Definition:** Value Investing is a strategy developed and made popular by Benjamin Graham (and David Dodd). It is a strategy to help (not a guarantee) find undervalued stocks. It focuses on safety and long-term gains. **Understand what you understand** Make sure that you understand which \"departments\" of the stock market you truly understand. Map it out for yourself, nearly everybody has an area of competence. Also, I recommend (like the book) sticking to it. You branch out over time or develop new areas, but I see a lot of people investing all over the place because they read a Reddit post or something. I like being pitched new ideas, but if they are outside my area of competence, I don't invest. You start looking for companies and find one; what next? **Analysis** The tool VI uses is fundamental analysis, which can be divided into 2 main parts: **Quantitative Analysis** (numbers) **:** It's numbers: P/E, P/B, earnings, etc. Most of you have this part down, no doubt. Also, there are enough tools today that can help you. This part is \"easy\". **Qualitative Analysis** (understanding the business): The second part is almost impossible to put into numbers, but it is as important, if not more important, than just \"numbers\". I have a feeling that this part is overlooked by many. * Understanding the business and where the company is going: * What is the vision of the company, short-term/long-term? * What makes the company better than others: USP, patents, monopoly, etc.? * What are the struggles of the company? * How is the market in general? How future-proof is the company and the market? * What makes them future-proof? **Examples why you need both:** 1. Example: Quantitative: Perfect numbers. Qualitative: It is in the postal market, which will disappear (depending on the country) in the next 5-10 years. 2. Example: Quantitative: Mid numbers (fairly valued or even slightly overvalued). Qualitative: Developed a new CPU which will be market-disruptive. In conclusion, numbers are a good indicator but tell only half the story! **How to find undervalued stocks?** This can be a very \"creative\" process. There's no blueprint for it; you need to look out, and everybody develops a different \"hunting method\". **Crisis:** The classic one buying when Mr. Market reacts irrationally and everybody is losing their mind. Buffett bought BoA in 2011 during their crisis and trimmed in 2024 after the key interest rate went down. **Looking where no one else is willing to look:** Michael Burry did \"anti-value investing\" by shorting the housing market by looking into mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Also it can be a small country or a hidden chamption. **Personal note:** During the pandemic, my sister called me (she works for a global player) and told me that the \"good\" times are over because they were starting home office soon with Microsoft products. That sparked my interest. I started calling everybody I know from different sectors, and everybody had the same story: home office with Microsoft products. I realized 1. the economy would gain momentum soon, 2. Microsoft would make some good profit. I went all in and bought them for 136€ (20k) and sold later for 275€. My best to this day. **In conclusion:** there is no real strategy for that but a direction. DeepFuckingValue said it: It's more like a feeling you can't really describe. You are buying a company, not a stock! (Buffett) This perspective really changed for me how I look at stocks, because you don't care how the stock performs today or tomorrow; you focus the most on the business side, and if this is going well, the stock will sooner or later follow. **General Advice:** **Be patient.** Finding true gems takes time even Buffett sometimes takes a year to find a good opportunity, and he does it full-time! I take even much longer; therefore, I invest in an ETF. **Value investing** doesn't teach you only when to invest but also when to exit! Having an **exit strategy** is truly underrated (if you need bad examples, go to WSB lol). **VI is not for everybody:** If you don't have the matching personality, don't! Find one that matches your personality. Be honest with yourself. **Sparring Partner:** Find someone who thinks like you and is ready to challenge your ideas. The wiser the better! Also expect advice that something a lot of people struggle with. I get so many phone calls from people who just want me to confirm their choice (of course, when they've bought already), and when I don't recommend it, they get pissed... **First DD:** I see so many people investing into a stock and than reading about it. Did you know Waymo is owned by Alphabet ?... AHHH **READ THE FUCKING BOOK:** It has 600+ pages; I swear there is more written than P/E ratio... If you have questions feel free to ask. **Side note:** I tried my best.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everybody The stock market is like an ant nest with its own departments each with their problems and own struggles . It is impossible to grasp the whole nestmarket . To navigate through this jungle you can use different methods and strategies . You can buy meme stocks you can pump and dump crypo you can 100x leverage on an option and get 100 likes because you lost your house and now live in a car . Today our focus is drum roll Value Investing . Definition Value Investing is a strategy developed and made popular by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd . It is a strategy to help not a guarantee find undervalued stocks . It focuses on safety and longterm gains . Understand what you understand Make sure that you understand which departments of the stock market you truly understand . Map it out for yourself nearly everybody has an area of competence . Also I recommend like the book sticking to it . You branch out over time or develop new areas but I see a lot of people investing all over the place because they read a Reddit post or something . I like being pitched new ideas but if they are outside my area of competence I dont invest . You start looking for companies and find one what next Analysis The tool VI uses is fundamental analysis which can be divided into 2 main parts Quantitative Analysis numbers Its numbers PE PB earnings etc . Most of you have this part down no_doubt . Also there are enough tools today that can help you . This part is easy . Qualitative Analysis understanding the business The second part is almost impossible to put into numbers but it is as important if not_more important than just numbers . I have a feeling that this part is overlooked by many . Understanding the business and where the company is going What is the vision of the company shorttermlongterm What makes the company better than others USP patents monopoly etc . What are the struggles of the company How is the market in general How futureproof is the company and the market What makes them futureproof Examples why you need both 1 . Example Quantitative Perfect numbers . Qualitative It is in the postal market which will disappear depending on the country in the next 510 years . 2 . Example Quantitative Mid numbers fairly valued or even slightly overvalued . Qualitative Developed a new CPU which will be marketdisruptive . In conclusion numbers are a good indicator but tell only half the story How to find undervalued stocks This can be a very creative process . Theres no_blueprint for it you need to look out and everybody develops a different hunting method . Crisis The classic one buying when Mr. Market reacts irrationally and everybody is losing their mind . Buffett bought BoA in 2011 during their crisis and trimmed in 2024 after the key interest rate went down . Looking where no_one else is willing to look Michael Burry did antivalue investing by shorting the housing market by looking into mortgagebacked securities MBS . Also it can be a small country or a hidden chamption . Personal note During the pandemic my sister called me she works for a global player and told me that the good times are over because they were starting home office soon with Microsoft products . That sparked my interest . I started calling everybody I know from different sectors and everybody had the same story home office with Microsoft products . I realized 1. the economy would gain momentum soon 2 . Microsoft would make some good profit . I went all in and bought them for 136€ 20k and sold later for 275€ . My best to this day . In conclusion there is no_real strategy for that but a direction . DeepFuckingValue said it Its more like a feeling you cant really describe . You are buying a company not_a stock Buffett This perspective really changed for me how I look at stocks because you dont care how the stock performs today or tomorrow you focus the most on the business side and if this is going well the stock will sooner or later follow . General Advice Be patient . Finding true gems takes time even Buffett sometimes takes a year to find a good opportunity and he does it fulltime I take even much longer therefore I invest in an ETF . Value investing doesnt teach you only when to invest but also when to exit Having an exit strategy is truly underrated if you need bad examples go to WSB lol . VI is not_for everybody If you dont have the matching personality dont Find one that matches your personality . Be honest with yourself . Sparring Partner Find someone who thinks like you and is ready to challenge your ideas . The wiser the better Also expect advice that something a lot of people struggle with . I get so many phone calls from people who just want me to confirm their choice of course when theyve bought already and when I dont recommend it they get pissed ... First DD I see so many people investing into a stock and than reading about it . Did you know Waymo is owned by Alphabet ... AHHH READ THE FUCKING BOOK It has 600 pages I swear there is more written than PE ratio ... If you have questions feel free to ask . Side note I tried my best ."

      "selftext": "The US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the total value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined. The total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We are increasingly borrowing to pay interest on existing debt. This adds more debt to the system and steadily worsens the cycle. The Fiscal Reality: The math is simple but the politics are nearly impossible. To materially reduce the deficit, the government would have to: Cut entitlements or defense. Politically untouchable. Raise taxes significantly. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, the average taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in additional federal taxes. With no credible path to balancing the budget, reducing the interest burden becomes the only realistic option. This creates strong incentives for lower rates and renewed liquidity support, even if inflation risks remain elevated. The Real Return Trap: The market, not the Fed alone, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation runs at or above nominal yields, bondholders earn zero or negative real returns. To preserve purchasing power, investors demand higher yields. That raises borrowing costs across the entire economy. Mortgages, corporate loans, and business investment all become more expensive regardless of policy intent. The Slower Growth Reality: Higher borrowing costs flow directly to consumers. Since consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of US GDP, this creates a structural drag on growth. More income is diverted to debt servicing, leaving less discretionary spending to fuel expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift. The Coming Shift: As the perceived risk free nature of US Treasuries weakens at the margin, capital will increasingly prioritize preservation. Over time, this favors markets with more sustainable debt levels and stronger fiscal trajectories. Moving before this adjustment becomes consensus may be necessary to protect real wealth. Read the full article (find it in other post, cannot post link in this subreddit) for a deeper breakdown of the mechanics and implications. I would recommend rotating into hard assets and value plays. If you are mostly in dollar denominated assets consider globally diversifying.",

      "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway remains a unique study in capital allocation and long-term value creation. Its diverse portfolio spans insurance, industrials, consumer goods, and equities, with a significant cash position that provides optionality in volatile markets. Given the company’s approach to underwriting float, share repurchases, and opportunistic acquisitions, I’m interested in discussing the fundamentals beyond the headline numbers. How are others modeling intrinsic value for Berkshire today? Are you focusing on normalized operating earnings, insurance float contribution, or the embedded optionality in publicly traded equity holdings? How do you weigh the potential upside from selective acquisitions against risks like interest rate exposure, regulatory constraints, or underperformance in cyclical segments? I’d also like to hear your thoughts on using metrics like adjusted book value, FCF yield, and ROIC as frameworks for evaluating the current attractiveness of BRK shares.",

Its diverse portfolio spans insurance industrials consumer goods and equities with a significant cash position that provides optionality in volatile markets . Given the company ’ s approach to underwriting float share repurchases and opportunistic acquisitions I ’ m interested in discussing the fundamentals beyond the headline numbers . How are others modeling intrinsic value for Berkshire today Are you focusing on normalized operating earnings insurance float contribution or the embedded optionality in publicly traded equity holdings How do you weigh the potential upside from selective acquisitions against risks like interest rate exposure regulatory constraints or underperformance in cyclical segments I ’ d also like to hear your thoughts on using metrics like adjusted book value FCF yield and ROIC as frameworks for evaluating the current attractiveness of BRK shares ."

      "selftext": "You can find the list of stocks that match his formula online. So I've been using Joel Greenblatt's strategy from \"The Little Book That Beats the Market\" and figured I'd share some thoughts. The basic idea is pretty straightforward. You screen for stocks that are both high quality and cheap, then buy the top 30 to 50 names with equal weighting. Quality gets measured by return on invested capital, which tells you how efficiently a company uses its money to generate profits. Cheapness is determined by earnings yield, which is basically the inverse of the P/E ratio. You rank all stocks by both metrics and buy the ones that score best overall. I typically filter for companies with at least an S&P 500 level market cap because I don't want to mess around with tiny illiquid names. If your screener doesn't have ROIC, you can substitute return on assets or return on total capital and still capture the same general idea. The whole point is finding businesses that earn a lot on their capital but are trading at reasonable valuations. One thing Greenblatt emphasizes is that the strategy will underperform the market for stretches, sometimes for years. That's actually why it works over time. Most people bail when it lags and miss the eventual payoff. You can find the actual stock lists through various screeners online if you want to see what currently qualifies.",

Happened cuz regulations went nuts after Sarbanes-Oxley, small companies cant afford all the compliance crap. Private money is everywhere too, VCs and PE sitting on piles of cash so good startups just stay private forever. Big corps also scoop up the small public ones faster than new ones list. Now the huge growth happens behind closed doors. OpenAI talking raises that could hit 800B+ valuation, zero public shares. SpaceX already at 800B private. Same with Anthropic pushing 350B, Databricks 134B, all locked up. NVDA went public in 99 and retail could grab it dirt cheap, ride the whole way up. That doesnt happen anymore, the 100x part is private now. So hows retail supposed to get any edge these days? Secondary platforms, small cap hunting, venture funds if youre rich enough? Or we just stuck buying winners after they already 50xd private? What strategies you actually using? Serious answers only, skip the bitcoin jokes pls.",

      "title": "GRAIL ($GRAL) - Early cancer detection to grow in tens of multiples",
      "selftext": "$GRAL is a pure play on early cancer detection, with its Galleri blood test targeting a problem the healthcare system has never solved well: catching multiple cancers before symptoms appear. Galleri can screen for dozens of cancers in a single blood draw, many of which currently have no routine screening, and that alone puts it in a category with massive long term upside if adoption scales. The addressable market is enormous, and success here is less about quarterly numbers and more about clinical validation, regulatory progress, and payer acceptance. From a growth perspective, the key drivers are FDA approval pathways, Medicare reimbursement, and employer or health system adoption. Each of those acts as a step function for volume, not a linear ramp. Once reimbursement is secured, testing can move from discretionary to routine, which changes utilization overnight. Recent clinical data continues to support accuracy and real world usefulness, and partnerships with healthcare systems help de risk the rollout while building credibility with payers and regulators. Near term, GRAL remains volatile and news driven, which is typical for high conviction healthcare names pre scale. Management presenting at major healthcare conferences like JPM - on January 12th 2026 will likely keep the story in front of institutional capital and often precedes updates on trials, timelines, or commercialization strategy. This is not a value stock or a trade on multiples, it is a long duration growth bet on changing how cancer is detected. If Galleri becomes standard of care, today’s valuation will look small in hindsight. #biotech #fuckcancer #cancerdetection",

      "selftext_processed": "$ GRAL is a pure play on early cancer detection with its Galleri blood test targeting a problem the healthcare system has never_solved well catching multiple cancers before symptoms appear . Galleri can screen for dozens of cancers in a single blood draw many of which currently have no_routine screening and that alone puts it in a category with massive long term upside if adoption scales . The addressable market is enormous and success here is less about quarterly numbers and more about clinical validation regulatory progress and payer acceptance . From a growth perspective the key drivers are FDA approval pathways Medicare reimbursement and employer or health system adoption . Each of those acts as a step function for volume not_a linear ramp . Once reimbursement is secured testing can move from discretionary to routine which changes utilization overnight . Recent clinical data continues to support accuracy and real world usefulness and partnerships with healthcare systems help de risk the rollout while building credibility with payers and regulators . Near term GRAL remains volatile and news driven which is typical for high conviction healthcare names pre scale . Management presenting at major healthcare conferences like JPM on January 12th 2026 will likely keep the story in front of institutional capital and often precedes updates on trials timelines or commercialization strategy . This is not_a value stock or a trade on multiples it is a long duration growth bet on changing how cancer is detected . If Galleri becomes standard of care today ’ s valuation will look small in hindsight . biotech fuckcancer cancerdetection"

My current retirement fund is the C fund with TSP and I would like to mirror those options with my Fidelity investment . Im just unsure which option to choose . The c fund is 100 % stocks with the SP 500 . Honestly I dont really know what Im doing when it comes to investing which is why I originally wanted them to do it for me I just know that my TSP has been doing well and historically it does do well over time"

But managing a \"custom index\" of 15+ stocks on there is a nightmare. I don't want to set 15 separate recurring buy orders and manually rebalance them every month. Basically, I want: 1.

I ’ ve reached the point where I ’ m spread too thin and tracking everything on a manual spreadsheet just to see my actual allocation which sucks . The M1 side I love the Pie setup for organizing my longterm stuff but I ’ m over the trading windows and the way their autoinvesting works . If one of my highconviction stocks starts ripping M1 ’ s dynamic rebalancing basically stops buying it because it ’ s now overweight . I want my recurring buys to stay at the fixed % I set e.g . if I set 10 % to Apple I want 10 % of every deposit to go there regardless of the current price . The Robinhood side The UI is obviously great and I love being able to set limit orders for flash crashes or just buy instantly . But managing a custom index of 15 stocks on there is a nightmare . I dont want to set 15 separate recurring buy orders and manually rebalance them every month . Basically I want 1 . M1style PiesBaskets for organization . 2 . Fixedratio DCA every $ 100 deposit splits exactly how I set it . 3 . Instant execution No_trading windows . 4 . A UI that doesnt feel like it was built in 1995 . I ’ ve looked at Public and Fidelity Solo Baskets but havent pulled the trigger . Has anyone found a platform that actually hits all of these Or a way to consolidate this without it being a second job"

      "selftext": "Hi all, I currently use both M1 and Robinhood. I both like and dislike both for different reasons, there has to be a platform that offers the best of both worlds... right? **The problem statement:** I love the flexibility and ease of use of Robinhood when it comes to investing in individual ETFs/Stocks, but it doesn't allow for an \"Easy\" way to make my own \"pie\" that I can DCA into. I love the ease of use and visual interface on M1 for making my personal basket or \"index\" that I DCA into on a recurring deposit, but it only has two times of day that a trade will complete, doesn't allow for fixed auto-recurring deposits (goes based off current weight relative to target weight), and some other restrictions. I love robinhood for index investing because the UI/UX is top-tier and I can just easily set recurring investments. I also love robinhood for individual stocks that I invest in on a conditions basis (certain price met, flash crash, etc...). I love M1 for making \"pies\" (basically my own index) that auto-invest based on target weight and my recurring deposits that are set to auto from my bank. The issue is, between these platforms and stragegies, and other aspects of my financial situation, I've spread myself too thin. Even just to rebalance my strategy takes too much time to check two apps, do calculations, track it on a separate spreadsheet bc I can't do it all in one place, etc.. Happy to hear others' experiences and would love any reccomendations, even if it's not a direct answer to my question!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi all I currently use both M1 and Robinhood . I both like and dislike both for different reasons there has to be a platform that offers the best of both worlds ... right The problem statement I love the flexibility and ease of use of Robinhood when it comes to investing in individual ETFsStocks but it doesnt allow for an Easy way to make my own pie that I can DCA into . I love the ease of use and visual interface on M1 for making my personal basket or index that I DCA into on a recurring deposit but it only has two times of day that a trade will complete doesnt allow for fixed autorecurring deposits goes based off current weight relative to target weight and some other restrictions . I love robinhood for index investing because the UIUX is toptier and I can just easily set recurring investments . I also love robinhood for individual stocks that I invest in on a conditions basis certain price met flash crash etc .... I love M1 for making pies basically my own index that autoinvest based on target weight and my recurring deposits that are set to auto from my bank . The issue is between these platforms and stragegies and other aspects of my financial situation Ive spread myself too thin . Even just to rebalance my strategy takes too much time to check two apps do calculations track it on a separate spreadsheet bc I cant do it all in one place etc .. Happy to hear others experiences and would love any reccomendations even if its not_a direct answer to my question"

There are a few catalysts behind this move: signs of improving memory pricing in channel checks, continued AI server demand, and technicals showing a break above short-term consolidation.

Today ’ s strength suggests some rotation may finally be happening . There are a few catalysts behind this move signs of improving memory pricing in channel checks continued AI server demand and technicals showing a break above shortterm consolidation . MU isn ’ t cheap but the market seems to be repricing the earnings outlook after digesting last quarter ’ s results . I ’ m thinking of holding and looking for disciplined pullbacks to add not_chasing at the top . Still curious whether this is the start of a sustained move or just relief in a choppy sector .

The Wegovy^(®) pill is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy approved for weight management. The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial^(2). In the OASIS 4 trial, oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6% mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities^(1). The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy^(®) pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy^(®) 2.4 mg. Furthermore, one in three people experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial^(1). The well-known safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy^(®) pill in the OASIS-4 trial, which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management. “The pill is here. With today's approval of the Wegovy^(®) pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy^(®) injection,” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy^(®) pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey. No other current oral GLP-1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy^(®) pill, and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US”. Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy^(®) pill in the US in early January 2026. Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg once-daily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025. How will the stock react? What do you think?",

The Wegovy® pill is the first oral glucagonlike peptide1 GLP1 receptor agonist therapy approved for weight management . The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial2 . In the OASIS 4 trial oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6 % mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities1 . The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy® pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy® 2.4 mg . Furthermore one in three people experienced 20 % or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial1 . The wellknown safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy® pill in the OASIS4 trial which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management . “ The pill is here . With todays approval of the Wegovy® pill patients will have a convenient oncedaily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy® injection ” said Mike Doustdar president and CEO of Novo Nordisk . “ As the first oral GLP1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity the Wegovy® pill provides patients with a new convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey . No_other current oral GLP1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy® pill and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US ” . Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy® pill in the US in early January 2026 . Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg oncedaily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency EMA and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025 .

      "selftext": "The recent pullback in ADBE looks more like a normal reset in sentiment and valuation rather than any real deterioration in the underlying business. The core fundamentals remain intact, with a stable subscription model, solid cash flow, and strong product stickiness. This is not a name that suddenly became structurally broken. That said, from a trading perspective, this is also not a high conviction entry yet. The short term trend is still weak, and recent bounces appear more corrective than driven by aggressive dip buying. Volume and price action suggest that larger players are still patient and not in a rush to re establish positions. For me, the right move here is not bottom fishing and not chasing short term strength. This is a wait and observe situation. I want to see selling pressure fully clear and price stabilize, or momentum meaningfully shift back in favor of buyers. Until then, keeping risk off the table is more important than forcing a trade.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, General question, the three major players are Tesla/Waymo/Zoox for the autonomous robotaxi future. Now assuming production ramps even marginally would these influence stock price? I believe Waymo is owned by google, zoox is amazon and tesla is tesla. The thing about Tesla regardless of what musk claims is that they dont have any fully autonomous robotaxis yet since they require a person in the driver's seat, in theory they could push an update and millions of cars would become autonomous overnight. Amazon is building a factory for zoox as well so I was wondering just how much they would affect tesla, google and Amazon over the next several years? Any comments appreciated just want to learn more about the market in regards to technology companies",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Shares in Paramount Skydance (PSKY) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) spiked Monday after Larry Ellison, the centibillionaire founder and executive chairman of Oracle (ORCL), agreed to personally backstop $40.4 billion in equity financing for Paramount's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. >Paramount stock rose over 4%, while Warner Bros. shares rose by over 3.5%. >In a securities filing Monday morning, Paramount Skydance — led by Larry Ellison's son, David Ellison — said the elder Ellison had agreed to backstop the deal's financing to assuage fears from Warner Bros. Discovery's board. Last week, the board rejected Paramount's offer in favor of Netflix's (NFLX) bid, arguing in part that Paramount is too undercapitalized to be able to get an acquisition across the finish line. >Paramount's announcement on Monday stated that the Ellison family trust owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that Larry Ellison had agreed not to revoke the trust or \"adversely transfer\" assets while negotiations remain open. >\"Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD. Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4th, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders,\" David Ellison said in Paramount's press release. >\"Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice,\" he added. >Netflix stock fell over 1% Monday. >Warner Bros., led by media mogul David Zaslav, has become the target of a multi-round bidding war in recent weeks between Paramount and Netflix for the storied film studio and its collection of broadcast networks. >In Paramount's previous proposal, which was rejected by WBD's board, David Ellison's company would acquire both Warner Bros. streaming and studios division and its linear networks division in a $30 per share, all-cash acquisition valued at $108.4 billion. >The Ellison family and Gerry Cardinale's RedBird Capital would backstop \"100% of our equity commitments,\" or the $40.7 billion in equity required to push a deal through, while Jared Kushner's investment firm Affinity Partners and a cohort of Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would also provide capital while agreeing to \"forgo any governance rights.\" Affinity later withdrew from the hostile takeover bid. >Larry Ellison's offer to personally backstop $40.4 billion in financing comes after Warner Bros. \"assert\\[ed\\] that the only fix would be a personal guarantee from Mr. Ellison,\" Paramount said in its Monday morning announcement. >Warner Bros.' mid-December rejection of Paramount's offer appeared to tip the scales in favor of Netflix's proposal, which would see the streaming giant absorb WBD's streaming and studios division. Under Netflix's offer, the streaming giant, helmed by CEO Ted Sarandos, would bring Warner Bros.' film and TV studios, HBO, and HBO Max in-house. >Warner Bros.' other news, sports, and entertainment assets, in its \"global networks\" division, would be spun off into a separate public company called Discovery Global under a plan initially announced earlier in 2025. >However, that deal would be likely to face antitrust concerns, already flagged by President Trump. A combined Netflix-Warner Bros. would control approximately a third of US streaming activity, according to data from JustWatch, which is likely to draw the attention of the Justice Department.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Shares in Paramount Skydance PSKY and Warner Bros . Discovery WBD spiked Monday after Larry Ellison the centibillionaire founder and executive chairman of Oracle ORCL agreed to personally backstop $ 40.4 billion in equity financing for Paramounts proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Paramount stock rose over 4 % while Warner Bros. shares rose by over 3.5 % . In a securities filing Monday morning Paramount Skydance — led by Larry Ellisons son David Ellison — said the elder Ellison had agreed to backstop the deals financing to assuage fears from Warner Bros. Discoverys board . Last week the board rejected Paramounts offer in favor of Netflixs NFLX bid arguing in part that Paramount is too undercapitalized to be able to get an acquisition across the finish line . Paramounts announcement on Monday stated that the Ellison family trust owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that Larry Ellison had agreed not_to revoke the trust or adversely transfer assets while negotiations remain open . Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD . Our $ 30 per share fully financed allcash offer was on December 4th and continues to be the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders David Ellison said in Paramounts press release . Because of our commitment to investment and growth our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders as a catalyst for greater content production greater theatrical output and more consumer choice he added . Netflix stock fell over 1 % Monday . Warner Bros. led by media mogul David Zaslav has become the target of a multiround bidding war in recent weeks between Paramount and Netflix for the storied film studio and its collection of broadcast networks . In Paramounts previous proposal which was rejected by WBDs board David Ellisons company would acquire both Warner Bros. streaming and studios division and its linear networks division in a $ 30 per share allcash acquisition valued at $ 108.4 billion . The Ellison family and Gerry Cardinales RedBird Capital would backstop 100 % of our equity commitments or the $ 40.7 billion in equity required to push a deal through while Jared Kushners investment firm Affinity Partners and a cohort of Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would also provide capital while agreeing to forgo any governance rights . Affinity later withdrew from the hostile takeover bid . Larry Ellisons offer to personally backstop $ 40.4 billion in financing comes after Warner Bros. asserted that the only fix would be a personal guarantee from Mr. Ellison Paramount said in its Monday morning announcement . Warner Bros. midDecember rejection of Paramounts offer appeared to tip the scales in favor of Netflixs proposal which would see the streaming giant absorb WBDs streaming and studios division . Under Netflixs offer the streaming giant helmed by CEO Ted Sarandos would bring Warner Bros. film and TV studios HBO and HBO Max inhouse . Warner Bros. other news sports and entertainment assets in its global networks division would be spun off into a separate public company called Discovery Global under a plan initially announced earlier in 2025 . However that deal would be likely to face antitrust concerns already flagged by President Trump . A combined NetflixWarner Bros. would control approximately a third of US streaming activity according to data from JustWatch which is likely to draw the attention of the Justice Department ."

      "selftext": "A lot of people say TSM is undervalued right now because of geopolitical risk. There’s no question TSM is a great company. But the market keeps focusing on worst-case scenarios, and I think it’s worth discussing whether that uncertainty is already being priced in too much. From a fundamentals perspective, TSM still has clear strengths in advanced process nodes, capital efficiency, global foundry market share, and pricing power. Its long-term competitive position hasn’t really changed. If geopolitical risk is something that’s always there but low probability, does today’s valuation actually offer a margin of safety? Or is this the kind of risk that shouldn’t be ignored at all? Curious to hear what others think is TSM undervalued here, or is the market pricing it fairly?",

At this point, I don’t see a clear path for Disney to outperform, especially with streaming still pressuring margins and parks carrying earnings. I’m thinking of selling out of DIS entirely and rotating the capital to NFLX, making it a larger holding. Netflix has shown consistent execution, improving operating margins, positive and growing free cash flow, and real pricing power via the ad tier and password-sharing changes. Any potential M&A (e.g., WBD) is upside in my opinion. My base case is continued earnings and FCF growth, which I believe gives NFLX a reasonable chance to compound meaningfully over the next couple of years over DIS. Curious to hear counter arguments or what I’m missing.",

I ’ m thinking of selling out of DIS entirely and rotating the capital to NFLX making it a larger holding . Netflix has shown consistent execution improving operating margins positive and growing free cash flow and real pricing power via the ad tier and passwordsharing changes . Any potential MA e.g . WBD is upside in my opinion . My base case is continued earnings and FCF growth which I believe gives NFLX a reasonable chance to compound meaningfully over the next couple of years over DIS .

      "title": "A Pure Gambling Play: LUNR (800% gain so far)",
      "selftext": "I've explained it once, but badly - if I don't collect my thoughts well in advance it's hard to explain the reasoning behind certain plays. This post is the start of **my redemption ark (in terms of me being capable of explaining my thoughts)**, and so I will try to explain once more but more carefully why I decided to buy \"LUNR tickets\" when it was trading at $8\\~ I've since then got an 800% gain on my options: [My position \\(not including the new one I just made\\)]( # It started with a message from a WSB discord user I'll forever love this dude, he told me about LUNR and an LTV contract, briefly explained why LUNR is going to win the contract and that he has invested into them. My initial thoughts were the typical \"yea right, buddy\" thoughts: * How do I know you're a mechanical/space/whatever engineer that actually understands what is required by NASA? * How can you be so sure, that they are the ones to get picked? * Have you even checked their financials? [My brain when I realized what I realized]( But then my ADHD-crippled-monkey inside my brain took over: * Wait, did you say only three companies selected? * Final stage of the contest? * Previous collaborations with NASA? * Wait, you told me that there's a probability two companies might make the cut? * $4.7Bln contract? This is a typical 'gambling' game, and every gambling game can be analyzed, simulated and if you do it well enough you can get an edge. You see I used to play poker, and when you want to analyze a hand you do similar techniques that banks use to predict stock market prices. # Simple Gambling Math Note: To simplify the text and make it shorter, I'll denote probability as P(event). Imagine that you're playing a simple \"roll the 3-sided dice\" game. Each side has a probability of being rolled equal to 1/3. Now say you're betting $1 on your favorite number and if you win, you get $1.5 back. You could calculate the EV (expected value) of this game by simply calculating: P(win) \\* amount(won) + P(loss) \\* - amount(loss) = your EV (of discrete probability) so in our sample game we have: 1/3 \\* $1.5 - 2/3 \\* $1 \\~= $-0,17 Roughly translated to human language -> In the long run, for every time you decided to play this game you effectively lost $0.17 If we can figure out how this \"LTV contract game\" is played and what are the individual probabilities then we can figure out if it makes sense to play this game or not. # Monte Carlo Simulations Now here's what I was thinking, there's a lot of information out there, publicly available. That allows me to guess what might get factored into this decision. So all I need to do is to \"define a game\" and the rules to play this game, run simulations of this game and then approximate the likely probability. Why do I need to do this? To be as independent as possible (and factor in different odds of a decision being made this way). **So this is the game:** You have 3 companies at the beginning and in the end (1 or with a certain probability 2 will be picked), you have a set of rules where each rule defines which company scores points with what probability (random events). At the start of the game you chose a number equal to the number of rules you'll randomly select from the original set. At the start of each simulation you will modify the base probability of a rule (/event) occurring (and you do so randomly). Run a lot of simulations -> assess conditional probabilities based on results, i.e.: **- P(LUNR win | IF 1 selected)** **- P(LUNR win | IF 2 selected)** Now of course it gets even better if you start factoring the odds of the market recovering, space age boom, etc. everything slightly improving your odds. # Results Even if the chances that 1 company would've been selected, the odds were stacked in your favor as long as you were buying deep OTM calls with long expiry (at the time I bought end of JAN 12.5C for roughly \\~ 45c premium each). The reason for this is that the leverage increases your volatility, but as a result of that you can potentially lose everything you invested into it, standard shares would just fall to a certain price. However when factoring the possibility of 2 companies being selected the eventual probability of LUNR winning became slightly greater than 1/2... meaning that it just didn't make sense \"not to play\" - even if you think they might lose. As of right now, if it wasn't made clear that 2 companies would get selected... then buying the deep OTM calls wouldn't pay off (or barely for that matter), mostly because the premiums are already high. However - NASA made clear that they have an intention of awarding two companies, to diversify vendors and prevent vendor lock in, making the calls still lucrative. Huge insider buying a month or so back also indicated larger odds of winning, further helping the \"narrative\" that this is a valuable play. **Trying to estimate a PT** The problem with companies such as LUNR is that it's increasingly hard to estimate a PT. One of the possible ways of trying to guess the potential price is to take the contracts that they signed and just add them to the market cap -> recalculating the price (it's not perfect, it's pretty inaccurate, but it gives you some kind of an estimate). If I just assume that the current price already factors in some of the 4.7B contract then with a mkt cap of around 4.7B you get $40 a share. I tend to use this number as \"the super-positive estimate\", I then take roughly 1/3 of it and declare it as the \"the super-pessimistic estimate\" .. i.e. $40 / 3 \\~= $13.4 Pessimistic estimate set as $40/2 = $20 The middle ground is what I use as the \"average, regular estimate\" i.e. $30 \\----- So, rough estimates: **Super-positive estimate: $40+** **Average estimate: $30** **Pessimistic estimate: \\~$20** \\----- **Super-pessimistic estimate: $13.4** \\----- This kinda makes it clear why I decided to go with $12.5C. Current price - USD 16\\~",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive explained it once but badly if I dont collect my thoughts well in advance its hard to explain the reasoning behind certain plays . This post is the start of my redemption ark in terms of me being capable of explaining my thoughts and so I will try to explain once more but more carefully why I decided to buy LUNR tickets when it was trading at $ 8 Ive since then got an 800 % gain on my options My position not including the new one I just made It started with a message from a WSB discord user Ill forever love this dude he told me about LUNR and an LTV contract briefly explained why LUNR is going to win the contract and that he has invested into them . My initial thoughts were the typical yea right buddy thoughts How do I know youre a mechanicalspacewhatever engineer that actually understands what is required by NASA How can you be so sure that they are the ones to get picked Have you even checked their financials My brain when I realized what I realized But then my ADHDcrippledmonkey inside my brain took over Wait did you say only three companies selected Final stage of the contest Previous collaborations with NASA Wait you told me that theres a probability two companies might make the cut $ 4.7Bln contract This is a typical gambling game and every gambling game can be analyzed simulated and if you do it well enough you can get an edge . You see I used to play poker and when you want to analyze a hand you do similar techniques that banks use to predict stock market prices . Simple Gambling Math Note To simplify the text and make it shorter Ill denote probability as Pevent . Imagine that youre playing a simple roll the 3sided dice game . Each side has a probability of being rolled equal to 13 . Now say youre betting $ 1 on your favorite number and if you win you get $ 1.5 back . You could calculate the EV expected value of this game by simply calculating Pwin amountwon Ploss amountloss your EV of discrete probability so in our sample game we have 13 $ 1.5 23 $ 1 $ 017 Roughly translated to human language In the long run for every time you decided to play this game you effectively lost $ 0.17 If we can figure out how this LTV contract game is played and what are the individual probabilities then we can figure out if it makes sense to play this game or not_ Monte Carlo Simulations Now heres what I was thinking theres a lot of information out there publicly available . That allows me to guess what might get factored into this decision . So all I need to do is to define a game and the rules to play this game run simulations of this game and then approximate the likely probability . Why do I need to do this To be as independent as possible and factor in different odds of a decision being made this way . So this is the game You have 3 companies at the beginning and in the end 1 or with a certain probability 2 will be picked you have a set of rules where each rule defines which company scores points with what probability random events . At the start of the game you chose a number equal to the number of rules youll randomly select from the original set . At the start of each simulation you will modify the base probability of a rule event occurring and you do so randomly . Run a lot of simulations assess conditional probabilities based on results i.e . PLUNR win IF 1 selected PLUNR win IF 2 selected Now of course it gets even better if you start factoring the odds of the market recovering space age boom etc . everything slightly improving your odds . Results Even if the chances that 1 company wouldve been selected the odds were stacked in your favor as long as you were buying deep OTM calls with long expiry at the time I bought end of JAN 12.5C for roughly 45c premium each . The reason for this is that the leverage increases your volatility but as a result of that you can potentially lose everything you invested into it standard shares would just fall to a certain price . However when factoring the possibility of 2 companies being selected the eventual probability of LUNR winning became slightly greater than 12 ... meaning that it just didnt make sense not to play even if you think they might lose . As of right now if it wasnt made clear that 2 companies would get selected ... then buying the deep OTM calls wouldnt pay off or barely for that matter mostly because the premiums are already high . However NASA made clear that they have an intention of awarding two companies to diversify vendors and prevent vendor lock in making the calls still lucrative . Huge insider buying a month or so back also indicated larger odds of winning further helping the narrative that this is a valuable play . Trying to estimate a PT The problem with companies such as LUNR is that its increasingly hard to estimate a PT . One of the possible ways of trying to guess the potential price is to take the contracts that they signed and just add them to the market cap recalculating the price its not_perfect its pretty inaccurate but it gives you some kind of an estimate . If I just assume that the current price already factors in some of the 4.7B contract then with a mkt cap of around 4.7B you get $ 40 a share . I tend to use this number as the superpositive estimate I then take roughly 13 of it and declare it as the the superpessimistic estimate .. i.e . $ 40 3 $ 13.4 Pessimistic estimate set as $ 402 $ 20 The middle ground is what I use as the average regular estimate i.e . $ 30 So rough estimates Superpositive estimate $ 40 Average estimate $ 30 Pessimistic estimate $ 20 Superpessimistic estimate $ 13.4 This kinda makes it clear why I decided to go with $ 12.5C . Current price USD 16"

I’m down quite a bit and at this point I’m not sure if holding makes sense anymore or if I’m just stuck in a sunk cost situation. 30k shares at 1,35. A big part of the story has been the lawsuits and alleged naked shorting, but so far there hasn’t been any real resolution. They’ve done multiple buybacks which on paper sounds positive, but the stock price keeps bleeding and the business itself doesn’t seem to get much attention compared to the legal stuff. I’m not trying to hype anything or push a narrative. I’m genuinely curious how others see this now: Are you still holding? Did you trim or exit? Do you think the legal angle is actually worth waiting for, or is the risk/time just too high? Just looking for opinions and discussion from people who’ve followed it or been in a similar situation.

Doesn’t really feel like AI demand is slowing more like TSM is the only one that can actually crank out these AI chips at scale. I don’t really buy the whole “AI hype is fading” story. Feels more like TSM is hitting capacity limits, not that orders are drying up. Short-term growth might slow a bit, but long-term? Hard to imagine AI scaling without TSM.

      "selftext": "1. Fed is cutting rates, for economic and macro reasons Gold tends to go up historically whenever this happens. 2. Fed has started purchasing $40bn in treasuries that basically means $40bn printed by Fed every month. 3. Trump is straightaway sending stimulus checks, $1776 checks are on the way and $2000 checks are likely to be sent next year before midterms. In addition, the government is also spending more money through tax cut, subsidies and on military. 4. Interest payments are bound to increase year over year, meaning the government is printing more money than ever before. 5. Geopolitical risk, with the withdrawal of US from the global stage, closure of USAID and threats against Canada, Europe and other ex allies like India, central bank buying by some countries in this group is likely to accelerate. Countries like China, Russia and India trust the dollar even less now so. 6. Retail demand, it’s become a momentum trade at this point and retail traders are starting to get in. Lastly, the way to look at gold is not how gold is performing against the dollar but how the dollar is performing against gold. Gold will go down if dollar is expected to become stronger. We saw this in early 2010s where after austerity and US economic recovery Gold started to go down and then flattened. That does seem likely in near future.",

      "selftext": "I just don’t think the potential can ever justify the current valuation. Let’s do some math. Currently space x holds around 90% of the US market and 60-70% of the global market, and their *total revenue is $5 billion dollars* (excluding starlink of course). Thats it. So even if you assume that the market for space launches let’s say triples AND that rocket labs can take a full third which is extremely optimistic as space x and blue origin have better technology, the potential yearly revenue shouldn’t be more than $5 billion. So even if they can eventually take a 10-20% net margin and earn $500 million, how can that justify the $40 billion in current valuation? How much stuff needs to be sent into space?",

      "selftext": "Watching the pre-market action on Oracle (ORCL) right now. After Friday's massive Quad Witching surge to $192.41, everyone is asking: Is this a breakout or a trap? I spent the weekend crunching the dark pool prints and the current options chain. Here is what the \"Smart Money\" is positioning for at the open: The $195 Conflict: There is a massive Gamma wall sitting at $195. If we open strong and flip $195 into support, the market makers will be forced to buy more to hedge, potentially sending us toward $210 very quickly. Dark Pool Support: The heavy institutional buying on Friday was concentrated at $182 - $185. This is our \"floor.\" As long as we hold above this, the trend is our friend. Opening Volatility: Expect a liquidity grab in the first 30 minutes. I’m looking for a specific retest of Friday’s value area high. My Strategy: I’ve mapped out two specific \"trigger zones\" for today’s session. One is a bull trap, and the other is a high-probability entry. I can’t post the full data visualizations and proprietary charts here due to sub rules, but I'm happy to share my notes and the specific Gamma flip levels with anyone looking to compare strategies. What’s your move at the bell? Chasing the gap or waiting for the dip?",

If we open strong and flip $ 195 into support the market makers will be forced to buy more to hedge potentially sending us toward $ 210 very quickly . Dark Pool Support The heavy institutional buying on Friday was concentrated at $ 182 $ 185 . This is our floor . As long as we hold above this the trend is our friend . Opening Volatility Expect a liquidity grab in the first 30 minutes . I ’ m looking for a specific retest of Friday ’ s value area high . My Strategy I ’ ve mapped out two specific trigger zones for today ’ s session . One is a bull trap and the other is a highprobability entry .

      "selftext": "Lately I have been getting a lot of posts into my timeline from the likes of Ed Zitron and others who claim that Ai and all the companies involved is a massive bubble. The accusations range from straight up accounting fraud (millions of unused GPus in Warehouses) to raising questions about IMO legitimate concerns like how OpenAI will honor a trillion dollars in spending commitments on a couple billions of revenue. We all know how Sam Altman responded to the question and its anything but reassuring. Now he was asked this question again and his answer basically came down to: \"People have a hard time understanding exponential growth\" Now, if the Ai industry consisted of 2-3 companies one could shrug this off and see what would eventually happen. The odd thing to me is that ALL of the most successful companies in TECH that are in amazing shape and print billions of dollars every year basically bet their shirt on Ai. Oracle is literally risking a 700 billion dollar business on this one trade, even worse on one company, which is OpenAi and who they do this massive buildout for. Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all invest tens to hundreds of billions into Ai in the coming years. They are turning themselves from free cashflow giants to some of the biggest debtors in the world. This can't all be based on hope. They must know something that we don't but what could that be? Some things seem just true no matter how you spin them: \\- There is no real path to turn compute expense into revenue (Depreciation not even considered) \\- Most Ai features that are tried in a larger corporate context are rejected (Nobody wants to use Copilot) \\- The models are hardly differentiated and it seems incredibly difficult to even make money with them at all \\- the power needed to keep scaling the buildout is not available \\- Some of the most prominent figures in Ai say that the current approach to improve Ai will never work \\- The Ai startup eco system basically is a insert 5 dollars and get 2 dollars out scheme financed by VCs (what are they thinking??) So what could it all be about? Is Ai the great distractor from something else? If so, why would the tech giants participate and risk their companies? Is Ai really much better than we know already and there is a clear path to creating some sort of AGI using the compute buildout? If so, rather than competing the companies must be colluding to keep this \"hidden\". IMO unlikely. Is it something much more banal where early AI seemed promising but now these companies are stuck in a narrative they can't get out of? Imagine what ANY scaling back from AI, from on of those companies would do to the market. TLTR: Why does the AI ecosystem show so many obvious red flags while attracting levels of investment that suggest those red flags don’t exist?",

      "selftext_processed": "Lately I have been getting a lot of posts into my timeline from the likes of Ed Zitron and others who claim that Ai and all the companies involved is a massive bubble . The accusations range from straight up accounting fraud millions of unused GPus in Warehouses to raising questions about IMO legitimate concerns like how OpenAI will honor a trillion dollars in spending commitments on a couple billions of revenue . We all know how Sam Altman responded to the question and its anything but reassuring . Now he was asked this question again and his answer basically came down to People have a hard time understanding exponential growth Now if the Ai industry consisted of 23 companies one could shrug this off and see what would eventually happen . The odd thing to me is that ALL of the most successful companies in TECH that are in amazing shape and print billions of dollars every year basically bet their shirt on Ai . Oracle is literally risking a 700 billion dollar business on this one trade even worse on one company which is OpenAi and who they do this massive buildout for . Amazon Alphabet Meta and Microsoft all invest tens to hundreds of billions into Ai in the coming years . They are turning themselves from free cashflow giants to some of the biggest debtors in the world . This cant all be based on hope . They must know something that we dont but what could that be Some things seem just true no_matter how you spin them There is no_real path to turn compute expense into revenue Depreciation not_even considered Most Ai features that are tried in a larger corporate context are rejected Nobody wants to use Copilot The models are hardly differentiated and it seems incredibly difficult to even make money with them at all the power needed to keep scaling the buildout is not_available Some of the most prominent figures in Ai say that the current approach to improve Ai will never_work The Ai startup eco system basically is a insert 5 dollars and get 2 dollars out scheme financed by VCs what are they thinking So what could it all be about Is Ai the great distractor from something else If so why would the tech giants participate and risk their companies Is Ai really much better than we know already and there is a clear path to creating some sort of AGI using the compute buildout If so rather than competing the companies must be colluding to keep this hidden . IMO unlikely . Is it something much more banal where early AI seemed promising but now these companies are stuck in a narrative they cant get out of Imagine what ANY scaling back from AI from on of those companies would do to the market . TLTR Why does the AI ecosystem show so many obvious red flags while attracting levels of investment that suggest those red flags don ’ t exist"

I’m referring to factors such as: the acceleration of AI and its impact on Google’s core businesses, ongoing antitrust and monopoly-related issues, broader macroeconomic and market uncertainties. Is an 8% position in Google a reasonable long-term conviction, or does it cross the line into excessive concentration risk? Thanks EDIT, I hesitate between Google and Nvidia, so after it, I even thought about putting 5% in Google and 3% in Nvidia, but I figured I'd be shooting myself in the foot by cutting it in half...?",

      "title": "KSPI: WeChat / MELI style. Super-app in Kazakhstan, expanding in Turkey",
      "selftext": "Kaspi (KSPI) is Kazakhstan’s “super app”. It's similar to WeChat or to Amazon, Klarna bundled with other services (like messaging and Uber Eat) combined. The app is made of three components: * **Payments**: payment processing + analytics for consumers/merchants. Ex: 1.1M of transactions for restaurant (73x from 4Q'24 to 3Q'25). * **Marketplace**: connects buyers/sellers with omni-channel commerce. Like Amzn, they are also growing their advertising revenues rapidly on the marketplace (+56% from 3Q'24 to 3Q'25). The marketplace itself saw 83.7M purchases (+36% from 3Q'24 to 3Q'25) * **Fintech**: BNPL, finance, savings inside the Kaspi app. Other than innovations like pay with palm, financing (micro credit) is their fastest growing product (+17%) with 40% being Buy Now Pay Later. Both Savings and Revenues are increasing (double digits). Kaspi also has an e-Grocery line (1.3M consumers. +53% YoY) and recently integrated Glovo. They use AI to enrich content, which translates into improved profitability. Kaspi Ai creates more attractive descriptions and they track the impact with CTR and sales. In short, Kaspi innovates and executes brilliantly. They have a clear dominant position, and given the network effects, I would qualify it as a moat. In terms of profitability vs price. Metrics appear exceptional for a consumer-facing platform: * Operating margin: 51.3% * ROE: 66.9% * FCF yield: 9.5% * P/E: 6.9 (market cap \\~15B) \\+ Kaspi just approved a $100M buyback in November 2025. In terms of governance, the company is still cofounder-led with: * Mikheil Lomtadze (CEO) 22.51% * Vyacheslav Kim (Chairman) 21.2% * Management has 3.9% Most importantly, the culture was built from the ground up with an obsession on the NPS (customer focus) - a bit like Amazon. What brought the stock price down? Mostly two reasons: 1. There was a short report made by Culper Research a bit more than a year ago. In brief, it ties Kaspi to Russia, suggests dealmaking and possible sanctions from the US. Kaspi has replied to the claims. Stock went from \\~$120 before the report to \\~$77 today. 2. Macro + Sector: The local interest rates are very high (base rate is \\~16%), smartphones sales are decreasing, and like with all banks, there are concerns with their loans health. **Uncertainty:** Kapsi expanded into Turkey with the acquisition of a local e-commerce player (Hepsiburada 2025). Kaspi appears to replicate what it did in Kazakhstan and is in the process of getting a local bank license. Their Q3 report indicates successes with UX redesign (higher CTR) and continued growth, but M&A + new market means risk. Finally, KZ regulatory/tax risks are real, and geopolitical uncertainty exists. I believe the president (Kassym-Jomart Tokayev) is a tailwind for increased transparency, liberalism, and a balanced relationship with Russia. In addition, despite some Russian rhetoric that questions the Kazakh's claim to nationhood, I doubt Russia can afford another military front - especially under a new narrative. On the other hand, FDI are positive again. I am bullish on Kaspi's development in Turkey and continued success in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. I opened a long position on 19/12/2025.",

      "selftext_processed": "Kaspi KSPI is Kazakhstan ’ s “ super app ” . Its similar to WeChat or to Amazon Klarna bundled with other services like messaging and Uber Eat combined . The app is made of three components Payments payment processing analytics for consumersmerchants . Ex 1.1M of transactions for restaurant 73x from 4Q24 to 3Q25 . Marketplace connects buyerssellers with omnichannel commerce . Like Amzn they are also growing their advertising revenues rapidly on the marketplace 56 % from 3Q24 to 3Q25 . The marketplace itself saw 83.7M purchases 36 % from 3Q24 to 3Q25 Fintech BNPL finance savings inside the Kaspi app . Other than innovations like pay with palm financing micro credit is their fastest growing product 17 % with 40 % being Buy Now Pay Later . Both Savings and Revenues are increasing double digits . Kaspi also has an eGrocery line 1.3M consumers . 53 % YoY and recently integrated Glovo . They use AI to enrich content which translates into improved profitability . Kaspi Ai creates more attractive descriptions and they track the impact with CTR and sales . In short Kaspi innovates and executes brilliantly . They have a clear dominant position and given the network effects I would qualify it as a moat . In terms of profitability vs price . Metrics appear exceptional for a consumerfacing platform Operating margin 51.3 % ROE 66.9 % FCF yield 9.5 % PE 6.9 market cap 15B Kaspi just approved a $ 100M buyback in November 2025 . In terms of governance the company is still cofounderled with Mikheil Lomtadze CEO 22.51 % Vyacheslav Kim Chairman 21.2 % Management has 3.9 % Most importantly the culture was built from the ground up with an obsession on the NPS customer focus a bit like Amazon . What brought the stock price down Mostly two reasons 1 . There was a short report made by Culper Research a bit more than a year ago . In brief it ties Kaspi to Russia suggests dealmaking and possible sanctions from the US . Kaspi has replied to the claims . Stock went from $ 120 before the report to $ 77 today . 2 . Macro Sector The local interest rates are very high base rate is 16 % smartphones sales are decreasing and like with all banks there are concerns with their loans health . Uncertainty Kapsi expanded into Turkey with the acquisition of a local ecommerce player Hepsiburada 2025 . Kaspi appears to replicate what it did in Kazakhstan and is in the process of getting a local bank license . Their Q3 report indicates successes with UX redesign higher CTR and continued growth but MA new market means risk . Finally KZ regulatorytax risks are real and geopolitical uncertainty exists . I believe the president KassymJomart Tokayev is a tailwind for increased transparency liberalism and a balanced relationship with Russia . In addition despite some Russian rhetoric that questions the Kazakhs claim to nationhood I doubt Russia can afford another military front especially under a new narrative . On the other hand FDI are positive again . I am bullish on Kaspis development in Turkey and continued success in Kazakhstan and Central Asia . Disclaimer This is not_investment advice . I opened a long position on 19122025 ."

      "selftext": "I keep seeing YouTube stock analysts say “just spin Starlink and it’ll get a better multiple.” Maybe. I just think the bigger reason is the structure. (Earlier reports: [SpaceX has started bank talks for a potential IPO.]( Starlink is the part with a solid cash-flow story, whereas the rest of SpaceX is still a massive capex burn. Splitting them makes the narrative easier to sell and gives insiders an easier liquidity path. It avoids putting the entire SpaceX bundle under constant public-market pressure. The risk is it might lose the space halo and get priced like a telecom. Then the whole debate becomes ARPU, churn, and terminal subsidies.",

Earlier reports SpaceX has started bank talks for a potential IPO . Starlink is the part with a solid cashflow story whereas the rest of SpaceX is still a massive capex burn . Splitting them makes the narrative easier to sell and gives insiders an easier liquidity path . It avoids putting the entire SpaceX bundle under constant publicmarket pressure . The risk is it might lose the space halo and get priced like a telecom . Then the whole debate becomes ARPU churn and terminal subsidies ."

      "selftext": "I’m currently evaluating the possibility of taking a position in Roblox Corporation (RBLX) and thought I could walk through my thought process. Over the last couple of dayss, I’ve taken the time to analyze the company data and attempt to determine if its current share price accurately reflects its underlying long-term value. Fundamentally, the stock has been under a lot of pressure, and this presents a great point of entry in my opinion. The engagement and retention figures are great, and the user base is growing steadily. The company is currently operating at a loss; however, it seems likely that it will be able to harness the power of operating leverage to significantly improve margins as the monetization of the business increases. In my opinion, this is one of the main catalysts for the stock to unlock substantial upside in the next 3–5 years. I also analyzed market sentiment and risk factors. The shares have been affected by some macro trends, such as high interest rates and underperformance in growth stocks, as well as doubts in the market concerning timelines for growth and profitability. A number of these risks are valid, such as volatility, regulatory risks, and competition, although I think they are underestimating the associated upside with revenue acceleration and margin expansion. From a valuation and technical perspective, this stock is currently being priced below where its prospects for scalability and profit-driven growth exist. Based on a model outlook that factors revenue growth, monetization gains, and scalability, I personally feel this stock has the potential for outstanding gains if such trends continue. The market conditions are also conducive for steady accumulation, which suits my investment strategy. In summary, my personal investment view is based on fundamentals, growth potential, operating leverage, market sentiment, and risk-adjusted valuations. Although there do exist potential risks on the negative side, I do believe in the potential for extended-term growth which currently is not factored in by the stock price. My strategy would be to gradually build positions, hold positions for 3–5 years, and keep a strict watch on important growth & profitability metrics. This is my POV, I just wanna know what I am evaluating is based on facts or I have some prejudice for RBLX, or am I missing something ???",

Over the last couple of dayss I ’ ve taken the time to analyze the company data and attempt to determine if its current share price accurately reflects its underlying longterm value . Fundamentally the stock has been under a lot of pressure and this presents a great point of entry in my opinion . The engagement and retention figures are great and the user base is growing steadily . The company is currently operating at a loss however it seems likely that it will be able to harness the power of operating leverage to significantly improve margins as the monetization of the business increases . In my opinion this is one of the main catalysts for the stock to unlock substantial upside in the next 3–5 years . I also analyzed market sentiment and risk factors . The shares have been affected by some macro trends such as high interest rates and underperformance in growth stocks as well as doubts in the market concerning timelines for growth and profitability . A number of these risks are valid such as volatility regulatory risks and competition although I think they are underestimating the associated upside with revenue acceleration and margin expansion . From a valuation and technical perspective this stock is currently being priced below where its prospects for scalability and profitdriven growth exist . Based on a model outlook that factors revenue growth monetization gains and scalability I personally feel this stock has the potential for outstanding gains if such trends continue .

In summary my personal investment view is based on fundamentals growth potential operating leverage market sentiment and riskadjusted valuations . Although there do exist potential risks on the negative side I do believe in the potential for extendedterm growth which currently is not_factored in by the stock price .

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m currently evaluating the possibility of taking a position in Roblox Corporation RBLX and thought I could walk through my thought process . Over the last couple of days I ’ ve taken the time to analyze the company data and attempt to determine if its current share price accurately reflects its underlying longterm value . Fundamentally the stock has been under a lot of pressure and this presents a great point of entry in my opinion . The engagement and retention figures are great and the user base is growing steadily . The company is currently operating at a loss however it seems likely that it will be able to harness the power of operating leverage to significantly improve margins as the monetization of the business increases . In my opinion this is one of the main catalysts for the stock to unlock substantial upside in the next 3–5 years . I also analyzed market sentiment and risk factors . The shares have been affected by some macro trends such as high interest rates and underperformance in growth stocks as well as doubts in the market concerning timelines for growth and profitability . A number of these risks are valid such as volatility regulatory risks and competition although I think they are underestimating the associated upside with revenue acceleration and margin expansion . From a valuation and technical perspective this stock is currently being priced below where its prospects for scalability and profitdriven growth exist . Based on a model outlook that factors revenue growth monetization gains and scalability I personally feel this stock has the potential for outstanding gains if such trends continue . The market conditions are also conducive for steady accumulation which suits my investment strategy . In summary my personal investment view is based on fundamentals growth potential operating leverage market sentiment and riskadjusted valuations . Although there do exist potential risks on the negative side I do believe in the potential for extendedterm growth which currently is not_factored in by the stock price . My strategy would be to gradually build positions hold positions for 3–5 years and keep a strict watch on important growth profitability metrics . This is my POV I just wan na know what I am evaluating is based on facts or I have some prejudice for RBLX or am I missing something"

Are we really supposed to not keep pumping into the S&P, therefore, into tech? What are our other options? I’ve been thinking and came to the conclusion that if the S&P crashes (like actually crashes), why do we assume that foreign stocks won’t also dwindle? Arguably the largest economy and market going down will dwindle down to wreck other markets directly or indirectly. It would be chaos. Is it time we suggest bonds to 23 year olds? (Joking). Obviously if I or anyone else knew how this thing goes, we wouldn’t need to worry. Just seems like a hard feat to ask people under the age of 30, to sell their shares in the S&P and hold bonds/cash when inflation is already wrecking your cash. Crazy times for sure, but wanted to see if anyone thought the same.",

It would be chaos . Is it time we suggest bonds to 23 year olds Joking . Obviously if I or anyone else knew how this thing goes we wouldn ’ t need to worry .

      "selftext": "Software has taken a relative beating this year: while the software ETF, IGV, is up 8%, many stalwart software names like Adobe, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Asana, Workday, and Atlassian are down or treading water at best. **My take is there's opportunity here, as a bunch of these names will return to the premium valuations they used to command. NOW, CRM, INTU, VEEV, CDNS, and SNPS are some ones that look interesting.** The narrative that has punished these stocks is that AI will \"eat\" software. But not all of the threats that have been articulated withstand scrutiny: 1. AI \"Eats\" Software: Overhyped. The idea is companies will use AI to build their software in-house and stop buying from software companies. However, defining and testing software still takes work. There's a reason companies outsource or buy what isn't their core competency, and this should continue in the future. 2. More competition: Slightly overhyped. The idea is it's cheaper to create software, so there will be more competition. This is likely true, and especially true in niche markets that were too small to build for in the past. However, the history of the software industry is that the cost to create it has steadily decreased, allowing better and better software to be created. Given this, with increasing supply of software it seems like competitive advantages like distribution channels, brand, and lock-in will continue to be important. So many current leaders probably continue to win here. 3. Seat model risk: Real but not catastrophic. The idea here is that SaaS companies have overoptimized on charging per seat, but with potential reductions in headcount and generative AI computing economics, a model of charging for consumption may make sense in many software categories (think Adobe charging per use of Firefly rather than monthly fee per employee). Feels like this will require a transition much like the the move from packaged software to SaaS. 4. Relegation risk: Real. The idea here is that someone could become the \"front end\" for all enterprise software, interfacing with the employee and directing requests to other services or incorporating those services. This feels real, even if you're a system of record: imagine Microsoft dis-intermediating Workday, for example, by having copilot take care of HR related requests. 5. Content generation risk: Real. The idea here is that products that primarily output or help employees output content are at risk from the models themselves. I think this one is real too; a company like Adobe is at risk here. Given all of this, I think it's possible to take a software name and evaluate its relative risk. I've done it for a bunch of names [here]( **Which software companies do you think are undervalued?**",

      "selftext_processed": "Software has taken a relative beating this year while the software ETF IGV is up 8 % many stalwart software names like Adobe ServiceNow Salesforce Asana Workday and Atlassian are down or treading water at best . My take is theres opportunity here as a bunch of these names will return to the premium valuations they used to command . NOW CRM INTU VEEV CDNS and SNPS are some ones that look interesting . The narrative that has punished these stocks is that AI will eat software . But not_all of the threats that have been articulated withstand scrutiny 1 . AI Eats Software Overhyped . The idea is companies will use AI to build their software inhouse and stop buying from software companies . However defining and testing software still takes work . Theres a reason companies outsource or buy what isnt their core competency and this should continue in the future . 2 . More competition Slightly overhyped . The idea is its cheaper to create software so there will be more competition . This is likely true and especially true in niche markets that were too small to build for in the past . However the history of the software industry is that the cost to create it has steadily decreased allowing better and better software to be created . Given this with increasing supply of software it seems like competitive advantages like distribution channels brand and lockin will continue to be important . So many current leaders probably continue to win here . 3 . Seat model risk Real but not_catastrophic . The idea here is that SaaS companies have overoptimized on charging per seat but with potential reductions in headcount and generative AI computing economics a model of charging for consumption may make sense in many software categories think Adobe charging per use of Firefly rather than monthly fee per employee . Feels like this will require a transition much like the the move from packaged software to SaaS . 4 . Relegation risk Real . The idea here is that someone could become the front end for all enterprise software interfacing with the employee and directing requests to other services or incorporating those services . This feels real even if youre a system of record imagine Microsoft disintermediating Workday for example by having copilot take care of HR related requests . 5 . Content generation risk Real . The idea here is that products that primarily output or help employees output content are at risk from the models themselves . I think this one is real too a company like Adobe is at risk here . Given all of this I think its possible to take a software name and evaluate its relative risk . Ive done it for a bunch of names here Which software companies do you think are undervalued"

      "selftext": "My weekly take on some stock ideas from this week's issue of Barron's Magazine which hits the newsstands on Monday. (With the holidays coming up, the picks were pretty light this week, so I had to reach for a couple of them.) **BURL** Burlington Stores is the stock pick of the week. Barron's cites that BURL has been a laggard among the off-price retail stores, despite a very high 30% growth rate and taking share from competitors TJMaxx and Ross. Burlington has put some recent execution issues behind it and it is a good time to buy with the lowest P/E among peers and the stock down for the year. **LLY/NVO** Jack Hough, one of my favorite writers, highlights the good year ahead for the GLP-1 makers, and particularly cites the lead that Eli Lilly has built. But my takeaway is the more important insight that Novo Nordisk is about to have their oral GLP-1 approved by January, and they will have a substantial advantage in this head start and the fact that their pill has done significantly better than Lilly's in current studies on weight loss. NVO is the contrarian pick here. **CORT** In an article about top performing fund managers this year, it jumped out at me that one of the funds, Tanaka Growth, had 15% of its portfolio in a single stock--Corcept Therapeutics (CORT). Corcept has a hit drug to treat Cushing's disease, but more importantly it has a potential blockbuster drug to treat ovarian cancer which could be approved this year. Tanaka thinks the stock could rise 150% over the next year or two.",

      "selftext_processed": "My weekly take on some stock ideas from this weeks issue of Barrons Magazine which hits the newsstands on Monday . With the holidays coming up the picks were pretty light this week so I had to reach for a couple of them . BURL Burlington Stores is the stock pick of the week . Barrons cites that BURL has been a laggard among the offprice retail stores despite a very high 30 % growth rate and taking share from competitors TJMaxx and Ross . Burlington has put some recent execution issues behind it and it is a good time to buy with the lowest PE among peers and the stock down for the year . LLYNVO Jack Hough one of my favorite writers highlights the good year ahead for the GLP1 makers and particularly cites the lead that Eli Lilly has built . But my takeaway is the more important insight that Novo Nordisk is about to have their oral GLP1 approved by January and they will have a substantial advantage in this head start and the fact that their pill has done significantly better than Lillys in current studies on weight loss . NVO is the contrarian pick here . CORT In an article about top performing fund managers this year it jumped out at me that one of the funds Tanaka Growth had 15 % of its portfolio in a single stockCorcept Therapeutics CORT . Corcept has a hit drug to treat Cushings disease but more importantly it has a potential blockbuster drug to treat ovarian cancer which could be approved this year . Tanaka thinks the stock could rise 150 % over the next year or two ."

      "selftext": "Micron Technology (MU) reported Q1 2026 results last Wednesday. Revenue of $13.6 billion was up 57% from Q1 2025. Operating income of $6.1 billion was up 45% from Q1 2025. The growth was partly from strong demand in its Cloud Memory business unit, where revenue increased 100% year-over-year. Management provided Q2 revenue guidance of $18.7 billion, or 37% quarter-over-quarter growth. For the full fiscal year, the average forecast of 30 Wall Street analysts, as reported in Yahoo Finance, is $73.8 billion, or 97% year-over-year growth. I created a valuation analysis model to see if MU could be a good Buy: [MU Valuation Analysis]( Adding the projected revenue growth and trailing operating margin provides 130 Value Points. My minimum required Value Points is 40, which represents the top 15% of publicly traded stocks. The current Enterprise Value of MU is $300.2 billion, based on Friday’s closing stock price of $265.92. This is 12.7 times the projected operating income of $23.6 billion. My Value Score calculation is 130/12.7, or 10.2. My minimum required Value Score for a Buy consideration is 2.0. Given MU’s growing capital expenditure investments, I replaced operating income with unlevered free cash flow in the model. The adjusted Value Score came in at 5.5, still solidly in Buy territory. MU looks like a strong Buy to me, and I bought some shares on Thursday. As always, please do your own research before making any investment decision.",

Operating income of $ 6.1 billion was up 45 % from Q1 2025 . The growth was partly from strong demand in its Cloud Memory business unit where revenue increased 100 % yearoveryear . Management provided Q2 revenue guidance of $ 18.7 billion or 37 % quarteroverquarter growth . For the full fiscal year the average forecast of 30 Wall Street analysts as reported in Yahoo Finance is $ 73.8 billion or 97 % yearoveryear growth . I created a valuation analysis model to see if MU could be a good Buy MU Valuation Analysis Adding the projected revenue growth and trailing operating margin provides 130 Value Points . My minimum required Value Points is 40 which represents the top 15 % of publicly traded stocks . The current Enterprise Value of MU is $ 300.2 billion based on Friday ’ s closing stock price of $ 265.92 . This is 12.7 times the projected operating income of $ 23.6 billion . My Value Score calculation is 13012.7 or 10.2 . My minimum required Value Score for a Buy consideration is 2.0 . Given MU ’ s growing capital expenditure investments I replaced operating income with unlevered free cash flow in the model . The adjusted Value Score came in at 5.5 still solidly in Buy territory . MU looks like a strong Buy to me and I bought some shares on Thursday . As always please do your own research before making any investment decision ."

Ondo Finance, which handles the actual tokenization (backing them 1:1 with real shares), got some good news earlier this month when the SEC closed a long-running investigation without any charges. That cleared up a big overhang. Around the same time, their partnership with Bitget really started showing results as the exchange handled over $88 million in trading volume for these Ondo tokens in the first week of December alone, grabbing about 73% of the total market share. They've since pushed past $500 million cumulative with over 100+ different U.S stock. names like Apple or Tesla among top. Is this basically a way for non-U.S. folks to get exposure to stocks without opening a traditional brokerage account? what baffles me is the trading volumes which suggest people are actually using it.",

      "selftext": "Hi, I've been throwing money at a 401k since I turned 18 and, even with maxing out contributions, am not exactly where I think I should be so I'm turning my sights elsewhere, namely my rainy day fund. I have two accounts, one for true \"oh shit\" moments ($10k) and the other in case I get laid off since I'm in tech ($40k). The $40k I have is in a HYSA at 3.3% that I haven't had to look at even remotely (knocking on wood). A thread here caught my eye asking about the catch of investing in SPY and it doesn't really seem like there is one. At this point, since I have a true emergency fund, would it be better to pull everything out of my HYSA and invest it into SPY or something else for the long-run? To throw a little wrench into things, I also have this weird feeling that shit is **really** going to hit the fan soon here in the US economically but I've been comically wrong so far. I've been a lurker here on and off for some time and I'm well aware that trying to time the market is almost 100% of the time a losing endeavor but I'm not sure if there's anything on the horizon that might be a catalyst that I should wait for. If I should keep it parked in a HYSA and just mess around with where my 401k is invested I'm a-okay with that, or if it would be smart to start looking at overseas Index funds I can do that too. Just not exactly sure where to go and looking for guidance. Thanks! Edit: Thanks, realize this should be in not only Personal Finance but I'm going to keep these funds as a true combined emergency fund and invest everything else.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi Ive been throwing money at a 401k since I turned 18 and even with maxing out contributions am not_exactly where I think I should be so Im turning my sights elsewhere namely my rainy day fund . I have two accounts one for true oh shit moments $ 10k and the other in case I get laid off since Im in tech $ 40k . The $ 40k I have is in a HYSA at 3.3 % that I havent had to look at even remotely knocking on wood . A thread here caught my eye asking about the catch of investing in SPY and it doesnt really seem like there is one . At this point since I have a true emergency fund would it be better to pull everything out of my HYSA and invest it into SPY or something else for the longrun To throw a little wrench into things I also have this weird feeling that shit is really going to hit the fan soon here in the US economically but Ive been comically wrong so far . Ive been a lurker here on and off for some time and Im well aware that trying to time the market is almost 100 % of the time a losing endeavor but Im not_sure if theres anything on the horizon that might be a catalyst that I should wait for . If I should keep it parked in a HYSA and just mess around with where my 401k is invested Im aokay with that or if it would be smart to start looking at overseas Index funds I can do that too . Just not_exactly sure where to go and looking for guidance . Thanks Edit Thanks realize this should be in not_only Personal Finance but Im going to keep these funds as a true combined emergency fund and invest everything else ."

      "title": "Is Tesla (TSLA) Poised for Another Breakout or Facing Resistance?",
      "selftext": "Tesla (TSLA) has been one of the most watched stocks in the market, and its recent price action is setting up some interesting trade opportunities. On the fundamental side, Tesla continues to dominate the EV market with strong deliveries, expanding Gigafactory production, and innovation in battery and autonomous driving technology. Its energy division provides additional diversification, though margins are under pressure from rising costs and increasing competition from EV peers like Rivian and Lucid. Analysts remain split on valuation: some see upside as Tesla captures more of the global EV market, while others warn that stretched multiples may leave little room for error if guidance or macro conditions slip. From a technical perspective, TSLA is currently testing resistance around **$310–$320**, which aligns with prior all-time highs. Support zones to watch are **$285–$290**, where the 50-day moving average and previous consolidation levels converge. RSI readings are approaching overbought territory, suggesting short-term caution, while strong volume on recent rallies indicates bullish momentum may still persist. Traders could look for breakouts above $320 with confirmation of volume for a potential momentum trade, or consider buying near $285–$290 with tight risk management if the stock retraces to support. For options traders, vertical spreads or protective puts could hedge against volatility while maintaining exposure to upside. In terms of strategy, long-term investors may focus on Tesla’s growth trajectory, while swing traders may exploit these technical levels for short-term plays. Macro factors such as interest rate expectations, EV incentives, and broader tech rotation will also influence price action. Personally, I’m monitoring TSLA alongside other large-cap EV and tech stocks to evaluate relative strength and potential rotation opportunities. I’d love to hear how others are approaching Tesla: Are you playing momentum, value, or hedging strategies? Which support and resistance levels are you watching, and how are you managing risk given the stock’s volatility?",

Turns out that $ STM has a major advantage with their PCM technology on 18nm FDSOI that lets competitors in the SOCuC business s their pants as nobody_in the industry cant compete with the area advantage ST achieves with their PCM technology . 3V programming makes charge pump implementations from coincell operation unnecessary . Radiation Hardned opens the door to a broad range of applications aside from automotive . Ive seen design comparisons with 4M NVM that consume 40 % less area which is a pretty big on the margin . Overall I think ST has a future cash cow technology providing a major advantage over competition like NXP Infineon TI . Glad to read about your opinions ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been a huge fan of UFC and WWE for over a decade and have watched how these sports have evolved over time from the traditional PPV model to major partnerships with streaming platforms like Netflix and Paramount/Skydance. The company’s owners and executives are also closely connected to the current administration, particularly Dana White and Donald Trump. Dana White’s recent appointment to Meta’s board highlights the untapped potential between sports entertainment, streaming, and technology. Looking ahead, I believe the UFC will continue expanding into more countries next year, opening up even larger global markets. The upcoming White House card could also showcase to the world how far MMA has come since its early days in the 1990s. Are there any TKO shareholders here? I’m curious to hear your thoughts on the company’s prospects over the next few years.",

The company ’ s owners and executives are also closely connected to the current administration particularly Dana White and Donald Trump . Dana White ’ s recent appointment to Meta ’ s board highlights the untapped potential between sports entertainment streaming and technology . Looking ahead I believe the UFC will continue expanding into more countries next year opening up even larger global markets . The upcoming White House card could also showcase to the world how far MMA has come since its early days in the 1990s . Are there any TKO shareholders here I ’ m curious to hear your thoughts on the company ’ s prospects over the next few years ."

(Thank you rklb, asts, and eose) I personally dont think my my luck will continue, but I still want to try my best to beat the indexes over the next few years of so. Im looking to shave some positions and reallocate into something new or potentially even ones in my portfolio currently. Additionally set up a weekly allocation to build the positions overtime And before someone says, you should do your own research, believe me I do. Im going to list below all single stocks I have in my portfolio and additionally some that I am looking at. Keep in mind this will be a long term position. I would be holding until at minimum 2028 if not longer. Let me know your thoughts on my single stocks in general and thoughts on positions to add as well.

The first day or two was a little disheartening, but it didn't go too deep in the red since the option had about 3 months left. Because the theta was negligible I decided to hold on to it for a few weeks. Soon enough, the reversal happened and the position gradually slipped into green territory.

      "selftext": "So I see a lot of posts with people asking about retirement investment moves and as I'm reading the posts, the majority are already sitting on $500k, $1.5 million or more. Great! I'm happy for them but to the average person who doesn't make over $100k a year, how can one achieve this? It's never too late to start investing, I fully understand the concept. Are ETFs the answer? I read something that said at the age of 40, I would need to invest $4k a month to reach retirement and live comfortably. If I put $4k a month into investing I'd be living on the street and the family would go hungry. Is the move to gamble on a penny stock? I'm just genuinely curious to see what others would do. We can't turn back the clock and start investing young. What's the play? Thank you *Edit- Reading through the comments, there is some great insight and I do appreciate the time some of you are taking to share your thoughts. I'm thinking that outside of an RRSP (I'm in Canada), possibly an ETF such as XEQT or VEQT may be best suited for my situation as I am in Canada. I will continue to read the comments and take some time to learn about some things being mentioned.",

      "selftext_processed": "So I see a lot of posts with people asking about retirement investment moves and as Im reading the posts the majority are already sitting on $ 500k $ 1.5 million or more . Great Im happy for them but to the average person who doesnt make over $ 100k a year how can one achieve this Its never_too late to start investing I fully understand the concept . Are ETFs the answer I read something that said at the age of 40 I would need to invest $ 4k a month to reach retirement and live comfortably . If I put $ 4k a month into investing Id be living on the street and the family would go hungry . Is the move to gamble on a penny stock Im just genuinely curious to see what others would do . We cant turn back the clock and start investing young . Whats the play Thank you Edit Reading through the comments there is some great insight and I do appreciate the time some of you are taking to share your thoughts . Im thinking that outside of an RRSP Im in Canada possibly an ETF such as XEQT or VEQT may be best suited for my situation as I am in Canada . I will continue to read the comments and take some time to learn about some things being mentioned ."

      "selftext": "This one will likely go over this sub’s collective head, but I’d like to briefly highlight what I believe can become one of the best industrial growth companies in the market over the next 5ish years. I’ve been consolidating into my highest convictions recently (6 stocks now account for 80% of my port) and $PCT became one of my large long term bets (was a smaller position before) after the recent selloff, after what was a positive earnings call, that mostly driven by the recent high beta selloff + shorts ability to press down the price of a lower volume traded stock. IMO this should hopefully be my best most “boring” multi bagger in my long term portfolio. For those unfamiliar, PureCycle is a company focused on commercializing their patented recycling technology that turns waste polypropylene into ultra pure recycled resin, that is essentially as good as virgin plastic. Their stock has been on a roller coaster the last few years, but they have been quietly building out and ramping up their Ironton, Ohio plant. That plant is the “proof” for the number of large customers currently doing trials and evaluating product. Customers are also currently positioning themselves for future capacity tied to the Augusta, GA and the 3 other planned international plants (more planned for the future). PCT is currently supporting trials so that by the time Asia and Europe come online, those plants are already spoken for. Making big enterprise decisions don’t happen overnight and all of PCTs large customers are going through the standard processes to trial and verify the product for themselves. I should also state that PCT has a longstanding relationship with P&G, so this is not just a small company that has been developing a rogue new technology unchecked. I believe one of the larger current overhangs is on the regulatory side. Large customers are waiting for that to officially clear before placing their POs because they’re not going to want to place orders until they are certain it’s officially designated as a “recycled” material. Progress is being made there and should hopefully see resolution in the short term. Lots of companies already have sustainability mandates but there is not enough supply to meet their demand. Thus, these companies currently have to spend that money on credits that cost up to $.80/lb. This means that PCT will not only be able to meet a supply/demand gap but also potentially provide pricing that is in-line with what these companies are spending on credits already. PCT also recently added a tremendous resource to their board, Val Mars, who is the 4th generation previous executive of the largest candy company in the world whose company culture has been leaning heavily into sustainable recycling. MARS could sell out the entire Ironton facility on their own if they so chose. Any future partnerships with MARS aside, upon joining the board, Val was quoted saying “It was great to witness sustainability in action at the Ironton Facility and to see how this innovative technology can give curbside waste a new life. As a champion of sustainability I look forward to helping guide PureCycle into the next phase of their growth”. From a personal standpoint as a long term AST holder, this reminds me of the early days when Chris Sambar (ATT executive) joined their board and was a big source of credibility/validity to the market. The Ironton plant is really the overall thesis maker right now imo. When proven out, which should hopefully not be too long, all the future plants will simply be pit stops on their way to massive scaling. Some future potential valuation thoughts: After the Augusta plant is operational, they could be doing as much as $1/lb in EBITDA. If the company is selling over 1 billion lbs then we can fairly assume a multiple of 25-30x. That would mean that with just the 4 plants expected operational by 2030 (Ironton, Augusta, Thailand, Antwerp), PCT is potentially a $25/30 billion company with a roadmap to recycling as much as 20-30 bln lbs per year. TLDR: One of the old school SPACS that’s actually a real company, but like many old SPACS it is hated and cast aside/low volume ignored. They are in the late innings of proving out the thesis and hopefully closing regulatory hurdles soon. If they execute their vision I can see this being a 10-20X from the current $1.5B MC valuation within the next 3-5ish years and if you squint hard enough I can almost see a world where it is 25-50X from here if the entire roadmap works out as planned. They’re a green, US company, so the politics should be favorable in the long run as well. I think just longing shares is best as the options chain doesn’t have much volume but I do have a small 2026 call position open as well.

      "selftext_processed": "This one will likely go over this sub ’ s collective head but I ’ d like to briefly highlight what I believe can become one of the best industrial growth companies in the market over the next 5ish years . I ’ ve been consolidating into my highest convictions recently 6 stocks now account for 80 % of my port and $ PCT became one of my large long term bets was a smaller position before after the recent selloff after what was a positive earnings call that mostly driven by the recent high beta selloff shorts ability to press down the price of a lower volume traded stock . IMO this should hopefully be my best most “ boring ” multi bagger in my long term portfolio . For those unfamiliar PureCycle is a company focused on commercializing their patented recycling technology that turns waste polypropylene into ultra pure recycled resin that is essentially as good as virgin plastic . Their stock has been on a roller coaster the last few years but they have been quietly building out and ramping up their Ironton Ohio plant . That plant is the “ proof ” for the number of large customers currently doing trials and evaluating product . Customers are also currently positioning themselves for future capacity tied to the Augusta GA and the 3 other planned international plants more planned for the future . PCT is currently supporting trials so that by the time Asia and Europe come online those plants are already spoken for . Making big enterprise decisions don ’ t happen overnight and all of PCTs large customers are going through the standard processes to trial and verify the product for themselves . I should also state that PCT has a longstanding relationship with PG so this is not_just a small company that has been developing a rogue new technology unchecked . I believe one of the larger current overhangs is on the regulatory side . Large customers are waiting for that to officially clear before placing their POs because they ’ re not_going to want to place orders until they are certain it ’ s officially designated as a “ recycled ” material . Progress is being made there and should hopefully see resolution in the short term . Lots of companies already have sustainability mandates but there is not_enough supply to meet their demand . Thus these companies currently have to spend that money on credits that cost up to $ .80lb . This means that PCT will not_only be able to meet a supplydemand gap but also potentially provide pricing that is inline with what these companies are spending on credits already . PCT also recently added a tremendous resource to their board Val Mars who is the 4th generation previous executive of the largest candy company in the world whose company culture has been leaning heavily into sustainable recycling . MARS could sell out the entire Ironton facility on their own if they so chose . Any future partnerships with MARS aside upon joining the board Val was quoted saying “ It was great to witness sustainability in action at the Ironton Facility and to see how this innovative technology can give curbside waste a new life . As a champion of sustainability I look forward to helping guide PureCycle into the next phase of their growth ” . From a personal standpoint as a long term AST holder this reminds me of the early days when Chris Sambar ATT executive joined their board and was a big source of credibilityvalidity to the market . The Ironton plant is really the overall thesis maker right now imo . When proven out which should hopefully not_be too long all the future plants will simply be pit stops on their way to massive scaling . Some future potential valuation thoughts After the Augusta plant is operational they could be doing as much as $ 1lb in EBITDA . If the company is selling over 1 billion lbs then we can fairly assume a multiple of 2530x . That would mean that with just the 4 plants expected operational by 2030 Ironton Augusta Thailand Antwerp PCT is potentially a $ 2530 billion company with a roadmap to recycling as much as 2030 bln lbs per year . TLDR One of the old school SPACS that ’ s actually a real company but like many old SPACS it is hated and cast asidelow volume ignored . They are in the late innings of proving out the thesis and hopefully closing regulatory hurdles soon . If they execute their vision I can see this being a 1020X from the current $ 1.5B MC valuation within the next 35ish years and if you squint hard enough I can almost see a world where it is 2550X from here if the entire roadmap works out as planned . They ’ re a green US company so the politics should be favorable in the long run as well . I think just longing shares is best as the options chain doesn ’ t have much volume but I do have a small 2026 call position open as well . Best of luck out there regards 10500 shares 40 x 326 calls “ Think left and think right think low and think high oh the thinks you can think up if only you try ” Dr Seuss"

I am thinking of it more as a sabbatical than early retirement since I plan to work again in the next few years. So far I have been DCA’ing into the following portfolio and holding the bulk of the money in SGOV. I know I have some overlap in ETF underlying holdings, open to feedback on the portfolio as well. My question is how should I approach entering the market right now? Should I continue to DCA, lump sum it, or some hybrid approach? My worry is a drastic market pullback. I know time in the market beats timing the market but when I’m going to rely on the money for the next year or two how do you think about that in safety terms. Finally, I plan to speak with a financial planner as well but figure I would poll the hive mind of Reddit. Thanks in advance.

      "selftext": "TL;DR: RuneScape bond prices might predict S&P 500 movements 7 weeks in advance (r=0.43, p<0.001). Virtual economies may capture consumer sentiment shifts before traditional markets. This is either a fascinating alternative data source or the world's most elaborate coincidence. Further research needed. # Introduction I analyzed the relationship between RS3 bond prices and S&P 500 performance between Dec. 2020 - Dec. 2025. The data suggests something unexpected: virtual economy movements may actually predict traditional stock market changes. RS3 bond price movements consistently lead S&P 500 changes by approximately 49 days, suggesting that virtual economies might capture early signals of consumer sentiment before they appear in traditional markets. # Methods **Data Processing Steps:** 1. Daily price data extracted for both RuneScape 3 bonds (via WeirdGloop API) and S&P 500 (via quantmod) 2. Inner join performed to ensure date alignment 3. Returns calculated as percentage changes: r\\_t = (P\\_t / P\\_(t-1) - 1) × 100 4. Rolling windows applied for trend and volatility calculations 5. Normalization performed using min-max scaling for visualization # Results **Key Findings:** * RS3 bond price movements consistently precede S&P 500 changes by 49 days (r = 0.428, p < 0.001) * Predictive relationship has strengthened since 2022, suggesting increasing reliability as virtual economies mature * RS3 economy is 2.2x more volatile than the S&P 500 (daily SD: 2.35% vs 1.09%) * This higher volatility may make RS3 a more sensitive early-warning system for broader economic sentiment shifts [Normalized 90-day moving averages showing RS3 bonds leading S&P 500 movements by approximately49 days.]( [Cross-correlation function revealing peak correlation at -49-day lag, indicating RS3 bonds leadS&P 500 by 49 days.]( [30-day rolling volatility showing virtual economy as a more sensitive early-warning system.]( The rolling correlation analysis shows that this predictive relationship **strengthened significantly post-2022**, potentially due to growing integration of gaming into mainstream consumer behavior. [90-day rolling correlation showing strengthening predictive relationship over time.]( Both markets exhibit fat-tailed distributions, with RS3 bonds showing significantly wider tails. This amplification of sentiment signals, combined with the 49-day lead time, creates a potentially valuable early warning system. [Distribution of daily returns showing RS3’s fat-tailed nature as an amplified sentiment indicator.]( # Trading Strategy Based on these trends, the report outlines specific signal rules for portfolio positioning using RS3 data: **BUY Signal (Increase S&P 500 Exposure):** * When: RS3 bond 30-day moving average increases by ≥3% * Action: Begin accumulating S&P 500 exposure starting 10-20 days after RS3 signal * Expected Outcome: S&P 500 likely to appreciate around Day 49 * Success Rate: 63.3% (based on historical backtesting) **SELL Signal (Reduce S&P 500 Exposure):** * When: RS3 bond 30-day moving average decreases by ≥3% * Action: Begin reducing S&P 500 exposure starting 10-20 days after RS3 signal * Expected Outcome: S&P 500 likely to decline around Day 49 * Success Rate: 39.1% (inverse - signals to avoid market) **HOLD Signal:** * When: RS3 bond moves less than ±3% over 30 days * Action: Maintain current allocation * Rationale: Insufficient signal strength # Software and Environment **Core Tools:** * R 4.3.0 * R Markdown * XeLaTeX * Claude Sonnet 4.5 for coding assistance **R Packages:** * quantmod * tidyverse * jsonlite * lubridate * zoo * ggplot2 * gridExtra * httr * knitr * kableExtra * scales",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR RuneScape bond prices might predict SP 500 movements 7 weeks in advance r0.43 p0.001 . Virtual economies may capture consumer sentiment shifts before traditional markets . This is either a fascinating alternative data source or the worlds most elaborate coincidence . Further research needed . Introduction I analyzed the relationship between RS3 bond prices and SP 500 performance between Dec. 2020 Dec. 2025 . The data suggests something unexpected virtual economy movements may actually predict traditional stock market changes . RS3 bond price movements consistently lead SP 500 changes by approximately 49 days suggesting that virtual economies might capture early signals of consumer sentiment before they appear in traditional markets . Methods Data Processing Steps 1 . Daily price data extracted for both RuneScape 3 bonds via WeirdGloop API and SP 500 via quantmod 2 . Inner join performed to ensure date alignment 3 . Returns calculated as percentage changes r_t P_t P_t1 1 × 100 4 . Rolling windows applied for trend and volatility calculations 5 . Normalization performed using minmax scaling for visualization Results Key Findings RS3 bond price movements consistently precede SP 500 changes by 49 days r 0.428 p 0.001 Predictive relationship has strengthened since 2022 suggesting increasing reliability as virtual economies mature RS3 economy is 2.2x more volatile than the SP 500 daily SD 2.35 % vs 1.09 % This higher volatility may make RS3 a more sensitive earlywarning system for broader economic sentiment shifts Normalized 90day moving averages showing RS3 bonds leading SP 500 movements by approximately49 days . Crosscorrelation function revealing peak correlation at 49day lag indicating RS3 bonds leadSP 500 by 49 days . 30day rolling volatility showing virtual economy as a more sensitive earlywarning system . The rolling correlation analysis shows that this predictive relationship strengthened significantly post2022 potentially due to growing integration of gaming into mainstream consumer behavior . 90day rolling correlation showing strengthening predictive relationship over time . Both markets exhibit fattailed distributions with RS3 bonds showing significantly wider tails . This amplification of sentiment signals combined with the 49day lead time creates a potentially valuable early warning system . Distribution of daily returns showing RS3 ’ s fattailed nature as an amplified sentiment indicator . Trading Strategy Based on these trends the report outlines specific signal rules for portfolio positioning using RS3 data BUY Signal Increase SP 500 Exposure When RS3 bond 30day moving average increases by ≥3 % Action Begin accumulating SP 500 exposure starting 1020 days after RS3 signal Expected Outcome SP 500 likely to appreciate around Day 49 Success Rate 63.3 % based on historical backtesting SELL Signal Reduce SP 500 Exposure When RS3 bond 30day moving average decreases by ≥3 % Action Begin reducing SP 500 exposure starting 1020 days after RS3 signal Expected Outcome SP 500 likely to decline around Day 49 Success Rate 39.1 % inverse signals to avoid market HOLD Signal When RS3 bond moves less than ±3 % over 30 days Action Maintain current allocation Rationale Insufficient signal strength Software and Environment Core Tools R 4.3.0 R Markdown XeLaTeX Claude Sonnet 4.5 for coding assistance R Packages quantmod tidyverse jsonlite lubridate zoo ggplot2 gridExtra httr knitr kableExtra scales"

Now let's say the company buys back 50 shares and keeps those 50 shares as treasury stock(instead of reselling them or retiring them) and now there are only 50 shareholders each owning 1 share.

      "selftext": "Moderna still trades like a “pandemic leftover,” but the fundamentals and global environment tell a much different story. A lot of major catalysts are starting to stack at the same time, and the market hasn’t fully caught up. 1. Pharma valuations are elevated, and M&A appetite is rising Big pharma is sitting on cash and facing steep patent cliffs. With valuations stretched across legacy pharma, innovative biotech platforms look increasingly attractive. Moderna has scalable tech, validated regulatory pathways, and a global footprint which makes it a logical strategic target if M&A ramps in 2026. 2. COVID and flu demand is stabilizing into a predictable seasonal model The market still prices Moderna like a declining pandemic play, but COVID is sliding into a steady seasonal pattern similar to flu. Combined COVID/flu vaccines have the potential to generate recurring annual revenue once results land. 3. Cancer vaccine development keeps gaining momentum The individualized neoantigen cancer vaccine program is one of the most watched programs in oncology. Early results were strong, phase 3 studies are underway, and oncology could become a major revenue driver. If approvals come through, this alone forces a valuation rethink. 4. Global regulators are moving independently. A huge underappreciated catalyst Europe, the UK, Australia, Canada, and Japan/Korea are increasingly making their own regulatory calls instead of waiting on the FDA. These regions are shifting toward more science-first healthcare policies. For a global company like Moderna, that means faster paths to market, diversified approval risk, and earlier revenue realization. 5. Global investment in next-gen biotech platforms Governments are putting real money behind pandemic preparedness, mRNA technology, and precision medicine. Moderna sits right at the center of those initiatives. My take: When you stack all this together, the $200 thesis doesn’t sound far-fetched. The market still prices Moderna like it has one product. The pipeline and regulatory landscape suggest otherwise. On the short interest side… Sentiment has been overwhelmingly negative, and short interest has been sticky for months. If any combination of oncology data, seasonal vaccine stability, or accelerated ex-US approvals hits at the same time, pessimism could unwind quickly. Not predicting fireworks, but the setup is there for a meaningful sentiment reversal if catalysts land. Curious what everyone thinks: Which catalyst hits first? Oncology readouts? Seasonal vaccine clarity? Faster ex-US approvals?",

      "selftext_processed": "Moderna still trades like a “ pandemic leftover ” but the fundamentals and global environment tell a much different story . A lot of major catalysts are starting to stack at the same time and the market hasn ’ t fully caught up . 1 . Pharma valuations are elevated and MA appetite is rising Big pharma is sitting on cash and facing steep patent cliffs . With valuations stretched across legacy pharma innovative biotech platforms look increasingly attractive . Moderna has scalable tech validated regulatory pathways and a global footprint which makes it a logical strategic target if MA ramps in 2026 . 2 . COVID and flu demand is stabilizing into a predictable seasonal model The market still prices Moderna like a declining pandemic play but COVID is sliding into a steady seasonal pattern similar to flu . Combined COVIDflu vaccines have the potential to generate recurring annual revenue once results land . 3 . Cancer vaccine development keeps gaining momentum The individualized neoantigen cancer vaccine program is one of the most watched programs in oncology . Early results were strong phase 3 studies are underway and oncology could become a major revenue driver . If approvals come through this alone forces a valuation rethink . 4 . Global regulators are moving independently . A huge underappreciated catalyst Europe the UK Australia Canada and JapanKorea are increasingly making their own regulatory calls instead of waiting on the FDA . These regions are shifting toward more sciencefirst healthcare policies . For a global company like Moderna that means faster paths to market diversified approval risk and earlier revenue realization . 5 . Global investment in nextgen biotech platforms Governments are putting real money behind pandemic preparedness mRNA technology and precision medicine . Moderna sits right at the center of those initiatives . My take When you stack all this together the $ 200 thesis doesn ’ t sound farfetched . The market still prices Moderna like it has one product . The pipeline and regulatory landscape suggest otherwise . On the short interest side… Sentiment has been overwhelmingly negative and short interest has been sticky for months . If any combination of oncology data seasonal vaccine stability or accelerated exUS approvals hits at the same time pessimism could unwind quickly . Not_predicting fireworks but the setup is there for a meaningful sentiment reversal if catalysts land . Curious what everyone thinks Which catalyst hits first Oncology readouts Seasonal vaccine clarity Faster exUS approvals"

I’ve based my stock selection on future PEG ratios, where I want them to be close to 1 and preferably below 1 in the coming years. I’ve also looked at forward-looking P/E ratios, where I want to see a clear decline from today’s P/E. In addition to that, profitability and growth are, as usual, important to me. Growth is reflected in the valuation metrics mentioned above. (ICICI Bank is one of India’s largest banks; it has strong growth, and I also believe in India as a market.) I currently hold a total of 19 stocks, of which 7 are outside the US, i.e. about 36%. I have exposure to 7 different sectors: IT, communication services, industrials, financials, healthcare, energy, and consumer. The allocation across sectors follows proportions similar to those in global equity funds. I would appreciate tips and opinions on the valuations of the stocks: • Siemens Energy AG • Netflix • Microsoft • Amazon.com • Cencora • Lundin Gold • UniCredit SpA • Meta Platforms A • Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B • Micron Technology • Advanced Micro Devices • NVIDIA • Broadcom • Alphabet Inc Class C • Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg Co • Eli Lilly • ICICI Bank ADR • Investor B • Rhienmetall",

      "selftext": "Need some advice. I’m more of a trader in how I treat my portfolio. I’m constantly looking to make moves with approx. 50% of the portfolio. The other 50% is is Amazon with a cost average of $211. A few days ago I bought some core weave (about 7% worth of portfolio). I’m already up over 20% on it, and I know that this stock is highly volatile. Shortly after the ipo I bought at around $40 and sold it all at like $43.. was happy to make a few bucks and at the time I didn’t know a whole lot about their business. And then I watch it run all the way up to $185 and missed out on all of those potential gains. So my question is this, should I take the profits now with the 20%+ gain in only a few days? Or should I wait this one out in case it runs back up over $100 and keeps running from there.. possibly retests the highs of $185. Full disclaimer, I did sell about 15% pf the shares near the highs today, so this question is for the reminding 85% which I still own. Thanks in advance.",

The other 50 % is is Amazon with a cost average of $ 211 . A few days ago I bought some core weave about 7 % worth of portfolio . I ’ m already up over 20 % on it and I know that this stock is highly volatile . Shortly after the ipo I bought at around $ 40 and sold it all at like $ 43 .. was happy to make a few bucks and at the time I didn ’ t know a whole lot about their business . And then I watch it run all the way up to $ 185 and missed out on all of those potential gains . So my question is this should I take the profits now with the 20 % gain in only a few days Or should I wait this one out in case it runs back up over $ 100 and keeps running from there .. possibly retests the highs of $ 185 . Full disclaimer I did sell about 15 % pf the shares near the highs today so this question is for the reminding 85 % which I still own . Thanks in advance ."

      "selftext": "25M seeking perspectives on leveraged ETFs, i.e. UPRO (3x leveraged S&P500). I’ve been investing for 3 years now. My strategy involves Dollar Cost Averaging into low cost broad ETFs like VOO/VT. I have a strong rainy day fund of 1 year expenses in cash in HYSA, along with seemingly steady employment, and 50% savings rate/cash flow. Due to my young age and very long time horizon (20-40 years), I’m very comfortable taking slightly more risk in my portfolio while I am young. I’m interested in adding some leverage to my portfolio, perhaps around 5-15%. I’ve been reading about leveraged ETFs and I understand the risks as well as the downsides like volatility drag/decay experienced on volatile assets in leveraged ETFs over the long run. Over this last year I’ve probably watched this video by Ben Felix about 5 times: [Investing with Leverage (Borrowing to Invest, Leveraged ETFs)]( I’ve also consulted LLMs as well as blogs from on this topic and it has really made me want to consider adding a slight amount of leverage to my portfolio. I’m well aware that we are in an “interesting” market to say the least. One that is very volatile and wouldn’t be surprising to experience a 10-15% correction within the next 2 years (which would be a 30-45% correction in 3x leverage). I’m completely comfortable with this and doesn’t intimidate my conviction in the market. With all that said, I’m curious to ask the community about their opinions on Leveraged ETFs - If you own shares in one, what has your experience been, would you recommend it? - Due to potential returns, is it better to add this position in a tax advantaged ROTH IRA vs a traditional brokerage? - Is it asinine/very stupid to hold a leveraged ETF position for 10+ years due to the volatility drag/decay? Or any other thoughts comments, thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "25M seeking perspectives on leveraged ETFs i.e . UPRO 3x leveraged SP500 . I ’ ve been investing for 3 years now . My strategy involves Dollar Cost Averaging into low cost broad ETFs like VOOVT . I have a strong rainy day fund of 1 year expenses in cash in HYSA along with seemingly steady employment and 50 % savings ratecash flow . Due to my young age and very long time horizon 2040 years I ’ m very comfortable taking slightly more risk in my portfolio while I am young . I ’ m interested in adding some leverage to my portfolio perhaps around 515 % . I ’ ve been reading about leveraged ETFs and I understand the risks as well as the downsides like volatility dragdecay experienced on volatile assets in leveraged ETFs over the long run . Over this last year I ’ ve probably watched this video by Ben Felix about 5 times Investing with Leverage Borrowing to Invest Leveraged ETFs I ’ ve also consulted LLMs as well as blogs from on this topic and it has really made me want to consider adding a slight amount of leverage to my portfolio . I ’ m well aware that we are in an “ interesting ” market to say the least . One that is very volatile and wouldn ’ t be surprising to experience a 1015 % correction within the next 2 years which would be a 3045 % correction in 3x leverage . I ’ m completely comfortable with this and doesn ’ t intimidate my conviction in the market . With all that said I ’ m curious to ask the community about their opinions on Leveraged ETFs If you own shares in one what has your experience been would you recommend it Due to potential returns is it better to add this position in a tax advantaged ROTH IRA vs a traditional brokerage Is it asininevery stupid to hold a leveraged ETF position for 10 years due to the volatility dragdecay Or any other thoughts comments thanks"

      "selftext": "Hi, I’m looking for some input on a small satellite allocation within an otherwise simple, long-term portfolio (core is a broad global ETF with ongoing DCA). My satellites currently include Google (GOOG), Nvidia (NVDA), and Broadcom (AVGO), but together they only make up a small % of my total portfolio. Given that limited size, I’m wondering: Does it make more sense to concentrate on 1–2 names instead of holding all three? For a 10–15 year horizon, which would you prioritize: Google (diversified cash machine + AI optionality), or Nvidia (AI leader, higher growth but more cyclicality/valuation risk)? Where does Broadcom fit for long-term conviction? This isn’t about short-term trading, just optimizing a long-term satellite sleeve while the core keeps compounding. Curious to hear your thoughts. Thanks EDIT: maybe I should add AMAZON....?",

I don't know if this is old news or if this is something that might be the next sector that is trending other than semiconductors. In my opinion I think the tech side is slowing down and only so much can be innovated when it comes to GPUs, Semis, we are now seeing RAM prices go up with data centers being built. But with data centers being built rumor has it the US power grid can barely keep up with winter (Texas / Illinois specifically) and black outs in summer. I was eyeing a few energy stocks ($BE, FSLR, GEV, BESF ETF) but I was wondering if these are already priced in? Is energy sector something that is lacking or can money be made in this sector? I think FSLR will be slower as solar can only do so much. $BE might be the way to go, GEV looks like it has amazing potential and BESF ETF too but I don't have the data on whats comprised in that ETF. (FINVIZ Subscription ran out) $BE also crashed with the rumor when SPACE X goes public they will put data centers in space, but the argument is space is cold and imo that idea is far fetched just to get Space X in the spot light. A month ago I was eyeing data center construction stocks but now with the US infrastructure I think energy might be the next trending sector? Thoughts?",

I dont know if this is old news or if this is something that might be the next sector that is trending other than semiconductors . In my opinion I think the tech side is slowing down and only so much can be innovated when it comes to GPUs Semis we are now seeing RAM prices go up with data centers being built . But with data centers being built rumor has it the US power grid can barely keep up with winter Texas Illinois specifically and black outs in summer . I was eyeing a few energy stocks $ BE FSLR GEV BESF ETF but I was wondering if these are already priced in Is energy sector something that is lacking or can money be made in this sector I think FSLR will be slower as solar can only do so much . $ BE might be the way to go GEV looks like it has amazing potential and BESF ETF too but I dont have the data on whats comprised in that ETF . FINVIZ Subscription ran out $ BE also crashed with the rumor when SPACE X goes public they will put data centers in space but the argument is space is cold and imo that idea is far fetched just to get Space X in the spot light . A month ago I was eyeing data center construction stocks but now with the US infrastructure I think energy might be the next trending sector Thoughts"

      "title": "Preferred Stock Trade for Potential 10-20% Return",
      "selftext": "I came across an interesting trade that I wanted to get thoughts on. It centers around Albemarle's mandatory convertible preferred stock ALB-A. This preferred stock pays a roughly 6% dividend, which is decent, but nothing crazy. Where it gets interesting is knowing that this preferred stock will convert to ALB in Mar. '27. This preferred stock essentially has a mandatory put option built in. This presents an opportunity to sell an ALB call option on a similar timeline. By my math, one could lock in a 10-20% return as long as ALB doesn't drop below $100 from its current $147. Here's how it works: 1. Buy 263 shares of ALB-A today for $16,100 2. Sell an ALB call option for Jan. '27 with a $100 strike price for $6,300 3. Collect $1,192 in ALB-A dividends between now and conversion 4. Reinvest the $6,300 in something safe like SGOV for an additional $250 5. Either close out the positions in Jan. '27 or roll the call option to Mar. '27 after the conversion has happened 6. Conversion happens in Mar. 27 when you'll get between 100 and 120 shares roughly So what are the potential outcomes here? If the share price is above $130, you'd make just under 10%. If the share price falls to $100, you'd make around 20%. The biggest risk is it falls to around $73 or below, at which point you'd start losing money. Ultimately no downside risk until ALB falls more than 50%, and potential returns of 10-20% as long as it doesn't fall more than 30%. Now, could it fall more than 50%? Absolutely. In fact it was around that range as recently as August, but I believe demand for lithium will provide price support. What else haven't I considered?",

      "selftext_processed": "I came across an interesting trade that I wanted to get thoughts on . It centers around Albemarles mandatory convertible preferred stock ALBA . This preferred stock pays a roughly 6 % dividend which is decent but nothing_crazy . Where it gets interesting is knowing that this preferred stock will convert to ALB in Mar . 27 . This preferred stock essentially has a mandatory put option built in . This presents an opportunity to sell an ALB call option on a similar timeline . By my math one could lock in a 1020 % return as long as ALB doesnt drop below $ 100 from its current $ 147 . Heres how it works 1 . Buy 263 shares of ALBA today for $ 16100 2 . Sell an ALB call option for Jan. 27 with a $ 100 strike price for $ 6300 3 . Collect $ 1192 in ALBA dividends between now and conversion 4 . Reinvest the $ 6300 in something safe like SGOV for an additional $ 250 5 . Either close out the positions in Jan. 27 or roll the call option to Mar . 27 after the conversion has happened 6 . Conversion happens in Mar . 27 when youll get between 100 and 120 shares roughly So what are the potential outcomes here If the share price is above $ 130 youd make just under 10 % . If the share price falls to $ 100 youd make around 20 % . The biggest risk is it falls to around $ 73 or below at which point youd start losing money . Ultimately no_downside risk until ALB falls more than 50 % and potential returns of 1020 % as long as it doesnt fall more than 30 % . Now could it fall more than 50 % Absolutely . In fact it was around that range as recently as August but I believe demand for lithium will provide price support . What else havent I considered"

For example, I am aware of [Exchange Funds]( which basically signs a contract to enter some fund by giving your individual stocks for rights to a larger pool of stocks, creating diversification without a sale event. Issue usually is that your stock needs to be part of an exchange fund in order to participate, so options here are limited. The thread about [\"enhanced direct indexing\"]( sparked my interest as well, but seems a little less straight forward since it seems to rely on taking a loan to buy a wide set of stocks via Direct Indexing, and then waiting for some of them to be \"losses\" that you can sell as you slowly unwind your loans and pull out of your concentrated position. Does anyone have other sources? [Fidelity's generic article]( seems to not really know of much beyond what we discussed already.",

      "selftext": "Currently, I have just been investing in the Vanguard All world ETF (VWRP) for the last few years. However, I’ve recently been considering making some changes so I can invest more aggressively and potentially see better returns in the far future. I’m in it for the long haul so it’s a case of just set it and forget it (I’m in my 20’s). I can quite happily ride out any significant dips/crashes. I plan to keep my weekly pension investments the same, which is just into the VWRP. This is what my new plan looks like: 67% - Vanguard All world (VWRP) 13% - Vanguard Emerging Markets (VFEG) 10% - iShares World Small Cap (WLDS) 7% - SDPR Emerging Markets Small Cap (EMSM) 3% - Xtrackers AI & Big Data (XAIX) Is this a sensible route for aggressive investment?",

I plan to keep my weekly pension investments the same which is just into the VWRP .

Its next move will be dictated by market forces alone. The Nasdaq opened higher yesterday and continued consolidating around 23,000, while Nasdaq futures posted two consecutive gains. The Christmas rally may be quietly approaching. * NVDA: Buy on dips, await bullish reversal. * MSFT: Trading within a range; consider going long only after it returns to 490. * AMZN: First stop-loss level at 220, second stop-loss level at 210. * AAPL: Look to 276. Only a break above 276 signals an upward trend. * GOOG: Faces resistance at 305. Look for a rebound near 310 to turn bullish; otherwise, remain bearish. * META: Wait for a pullback near 660 to confirm new support before going long. * TSLA: Facing strong resistance at 490, unable to boost valuation. Holders may consider liquidating positions to enjoy the holidays. Not a Musk supporter? Avoid chasing the price higher here.",

      "selftext": "I’m a market analyst, and I wanted to share how I currently think about silver not as a trade idea, but as a portfolio component in the current macro environment. From my perspective, silver’s strength this year reflects more than just speculative interest. Several structural factors are converging: 1) Macro backdrop: Falling interest rates and rising fiscal deficits have renewed interest in real assets as stores of value. 2) Investment demand: Both institutional and retail flows into silver ETFs have accelerated, suggesting broader participation rather than isolated speculation. 3) Industrial demand: Silver is increasingly tied to long-term trends such as solar energy, electric vehicles, and data centres areas with secular growth. 4) Supply dynamics: Physical market tightness, particularly in London, has limited available supply, with constraints expected to persist. What makes silver interesting to me is its dual nature part monetary metal, part industrial input. That combination gives it a different risk-return profile than gold or purely cyclical commodities. This isn’t a recommendation to buy or sell just my analytical framework.",

I have 3 stocks (NBIS, BMNR, and CRWV) that equate to about $35K in losses thus far, does it make sense to sell those off to TLH? Does it still make sense to TLH if I believe that 1 or 2 of those stocks will eventually rebound in 2026? **Scenario 1:** I dont do anything, I will pay capitals gains tax (37%) on $61K, which is around $22.5K. **Scenario 2:** I go ahead and do the TLH and now my gains are $26K and my tax liability is $9600. With Scenario 1, I would have effectively profited $38.5K. With Scenario 2, I would profit around $16,400. So what is the purpose of TLH if the profit is going to be considerably less?",

I have 3 stocks NBIS BMNR and CRWV that equate to about $ 35K in losses thus far does it make sense to sell those off to TLH Does it still make sense to TLH if I believe that 1 or 2 of those stocks will eventually rebound in 2026 Scenario 1 I dont do anything I will pay capitals gains tax 37 % on $ 61K which is around $ 22.5K . Scenario 2 I go ahead and do the TLH and now my gains are $ 26K and my tax liability is $ 9600 . With Scenario 1 I would have effectively profited $ 38.5K . With Scenario 2 I would profit around $ 16400 . So what is the purpose of TLH if the profit is going to be considerably less"

Dell fuk.** **EDIT (12/24/2025):** Added article for HPQ (on top of existing Lenovo's strategy) announcing during their previous earnings call that they expect to have relatively smoother 2026 because they have a good memory stockpile to soften the blow from the shortage. Also, Dell is currently feeling considerably more CSG margin hit absorption than originally forecasted in November, and its accelerating. According to[ techradar article]( >[*Dell*]( *is set to increase prices on its commercial products starting December 17, affecting laptops, desktops,* [*mobile workstations*]( and AI-enabled workstations.* >*Internal documents reviewed by* [*Business Insider*]( *revealed models with higher RAM or SSD storage will see the largest increases.* >*Laptops and desktops with 32GB of memory will rise between $130 and $230, while top-tier 128GB configurations could cost an additional $520 to $765.* **edit:** This post was deleted by reddit's \"bad url\" filter (gay) **Who tf is Gom\\_KBull and Why should I listen?** Back in April when SOXL was trading at 8-11 range, I took out a loan and loaded up every single LEAP i could This was [screenshot ]( June and [screenshot ]( July I've sold off all the LEAPs on these in early November, ending in a 3 bagger... although most of us profited big over that 6 month bull-run. Back in November 10, i've put out a [warning ]( shit didnt feel right anymore and the bull run was likely over. This is about all I have as far as credibility (so far). # # The RAM Shortage Preface *Alot of this section is basic knowledge, you can skip if this you are already aware of the RAM shortage.* In case you've been living under a rock, the price of RAM has been going parabolic. This is because AI hyperscalers are offering b00k00 bucks to memory producers for their AI slop generators. So the RAM farmers said \"oh shit, fuck DRAM lets make and sell a metric assload of HBM\" **There are ONLY 3 major memory producers on planet earth: Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron.** **DRAM supply ⬇️, DRAM price ⬆️** But the reality now and going forward into 2026 is: **DRAM supply ⬇️⬇️⬇️, DRAM price ⬆️⬆️⬆️** [Exhibit A]( [Exhibit]( B What does this mean? EVERYTHING in tech is getting squeezed, especially areas that are NOT directly exposed to AI profitability. Everything tech related NEEDS memory, but as long as you're not using HBMs you're going to the second-priority lane. Among the roadkill in this RAM storm, the juiciest looks like Dell. # What is Dell's profitability and exposure looking in this quarter? DELL's revenue stream essentially comes half and half for 2025. One part is ISG (Infrastructure Solutions Group). This side is from providing AI-related solutions, focusing on infrastructure (hello datacenters). The other half is CSG, everytime you see a shiddy DELL laptop, or hardware... this is CSG side. Dell's CSG side of the business is completely fucked (at least for 2026). *Why?* Because Dell is paying 4x for RAM and the cost is only accelerating. Lenovo is hoarding RAM to mitigate this damage ( i tried to link evidence but it got flagged by reddit, but they are front page if you google \"Lenovo Hoarding\"), other PC and smartphone companies (MSFT/AAPL and the like) have long term contracts to LOCK IN prices for their supply. Not to mention MSFT and AAPL are already heavily in the AI game... MUCH more than DELL is. EDIT: Even HPQ (hewlett packard) is stockpiling memory to soften its blow, which DELL has NOT which is absurdly poor planning. [Source]( >*During* [*HP’s earnings call*]( *at the end of November, HP CEO Enrique Lores expressed similar sentiments. Though Lores did say that the first half of 2026 should be okay for HP since the company currently has a memory stockpile.* [*Bloomberg reported*]( *that Lenovo has also begun stockpiling PC memory to get through at least 2026.* *Does Dell have this security or anything similar?* **NOPE.** Up until 2025, Dell has been known to have short term supply arrangements as its key strength. Now in late 2025 to all of 2026... its their **Achilles' tendon**. The COO (Jeff Clark) of Dell stated >*“We’re in a very unique time. It’s unprecedented. We have not seen costs move at the rate that we’ve seen. And by the way, it’s not unique to DRAM, it’s NAND. It is hard drives, leading edge nodes across the semiconductor network,” he told analysts. “I’d categorize it as demand is way ahead of supply, and as we wade our way through that, we’re going to lean on the things that we’ve always done.”* **This is corporate speak for** >*\"Oh shit oh shit oh shit. This wasn't supposed to happen. Oh god, we're so fuk\"* And Dell has also noted it plans to raise the prices of their products by 10-30% to offset their costs. Here's the problem... ***WHO IS PAYING 20%+ more for Dell products?*** Think about it... would corporates (or even individuals) bite their tongue and pay >20% premium for shiddy Dell laptops and PCs? They have already laid off tens of thousands of employees, they are not in a position to easily fork over cash at a premium for bulk PCs/laptops. There will be customers (both corporate and individual) who are more than willing to just let their existing hardware tough it out for 2-3 years until prices stabilize (hopefully)... and that's IF they don't just look elsewhere. And personally, I believe Dell won't stop at a 30% increase. If these RAM prices continue to rise as they are, Dell will have no choice but to go farther beyond this. But what else CAN they do? They don't have a strategy or countermeasure. This is the last resort when you're supply chain fucks you. As for the ISG side, I admit Dell's operating margins are improving quarter over quarter... but this wont do much to outshine the pain CSG side is feeling. In the big picture, their ISG side has a very very small margin for profitability. Its not very profitable for them right now, but they HAVE TO do it to stay relevant in the AI heavy economic environment we are in. # But what if this is already priced in? It is to a small extent I'll admit, my thesis still holds that Wall street does not fully foresee the horror show that will unfold when DELL releases their numbers in February. **Add onto that, because we don't foresee RAM shortage letting up in 2026-2027, but instead being just as bad or worse for future quarters... They will have to mention that in upcoming guidance.** # How do the Insiders feel? **According to Quiver Quant:** >Dell Technologies insiders have traded $DELL stock on the open market 464 times in the past 6 months. Of those trades, **0 have been purchases** and **464 have been sales**. Here’s a breakdown of [recent trading of $DELL stock]( by insiders over the last 6 months: * [MICHAEL S DELL]( (Chief Executive Officer) has made 0 purchases and 2 sales selling 16,253,968 shares for an estimated **$2,222,753,260**. * IV (GP), L.L.C. SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6,315,957 shares for an estimated **$864,817,529**. * V (GP), L.L.C. SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6,315,957 shares for an estimated **$864,817,529**. * [WILLIAM D GREEN]( has made 0 purchases and 6 sales selling 272,736 shares for an estimated **$39,695,260**. * [ELLEN JAMISON KULLMAN]( sold 79,806 shares for an estimated **$12,255,009** * [WILLIAM F SCANNELL]( (Pres., Glob. Sales & Cust. Ops) sold 91,230 shares for an estimated **$10,803,456** * [EGON DURBAN]( sold 71,000 shares for an estimated **$9,806,520 . . .** # External Considerations * **The fed already booted up QE** * *The fed started reserve management purchases (soft QE?) but its at a much smaller rate than before and only to short dated treasury bills. Beyond providing some health for smallcaps and unfucking the bond yield rates, I don't see this affecting my play for Dell in any meaningful way.* * **AI unwind** * This does not rely on the \"AI Bubble\" or \"AI sentiment souring.\" If AI is dying through the market, this will just be added headwind for Dell. * **What if the RAM Shortage Ends too soon to matter?** * Its already happening, and Dell is ALREADY feeling the pain... moreso than others in its sector (likely HPQ is going through the same but it doesnt seem to be have much meat left on the bones) * RAM production facilities are being built but will take years to start being operational to matter for this play. **Positions:** 20x DELL Mar 20 2026 90 Put 80x DELL APR 17, 2026 75 Put *And I will be accumulating more as we get closer to their earnings in February* *Since Dell's earnings is in February and Micron's earnings will be in March, i might flip my winnings(if any) between the 2 dates.*",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Dell caught with its pants down RAM drought too painful . Dell fuk . EDIT 12242025 Added article for HPQ on top of existing Lenovos strategy announcing during their previous earnings call that they expect to have relatively smoother 2026 because they have a good memory stockpile to soften the blow from the shortage . Also Dell is currently feeling considerably more CSG margin hit absorption than originally forecasted in November and its accelerating . According to techradar article Dell is set to increase prices on its commercial products starting December 17 affecting laptops desktops mobile workstations and AIenabled workstations . Internal documents reviewed by Business Insider revealed models with higher RAM or SSD storage will see the largest increases . Laptops and desktops with 32GB of memory will rise between $ 130 and $ 230 while toptier 128GB configurations could cost an additional $ 520 to $ 765 . edit This post was deleted by reddits bad url filter gay Who tf is Gom_KBull and Why should I listen Back in April when SOXL was trading at 811 range I took out a loan and loaded up every single LEAP i could This was screenshot June and screenshot July Ive sold off all the LEAPs on these in early November ending in a 3 bagger ... although most of us profited big over that 6 month bullrun . Back in November 10 ive put out a warning shit didnt feel right anymore and the bull run was likely over . This is about all I have as far as credibility so far . The RAM Shortage Preface Alot of this section is basic knowledge you can skip if this you are already aware of the RAM shortage . In case youve been living under a rock the price of RAM has been going parabolic . This is because AI hyperscalers are offering b00k00 bucks to memory producers for their AI slop generators . So the RAM farmers said oh shit fuck DRAM lets make and sell a metric assload of HBM There are ONLY 3 major memory producers on planet earth Samsung SK Hynix Micron . DRAM supply ⬇️ DRAM price ⬆️ But the reality now and going forward into 2026 is DRAM supply ⬇️⬇️⬇️ DRAM price ⬆️⬆️⬆️ Exhibit A Exhibit B What does this mean EVERYTHING in tech is getting squeezed especially areas that are NOT_directly exposed to AI profitability . Everything tech related NEEDS memory but as long as youre not_using HBMs youre going to the secondpriority lane . Among the roadkill in this RAM storm the juiciest looks like Dell . What is Dells profitability and exposure looking in this quarter DELLs revenue stream essentially comes half and half for 2025 . One part is ISG Infrastructure Solutions Group . This side is from providing AIrelated solutions focusing on infrastructure hello datacenters . The other half is CSG everytime you see a shiddy DELL laptop or hardware ... this is CSG side . Dells CSG side of the business is completely fucked at least for 2026 . Why Because Dell is paying 4x for RAM and the cost is only accelerating . Lenovo is hoarding RAM to mitigate this damage i tried to link evidence but it got flagged by reddit but they are front page if you google Lenovo Hoarding other PC and smartphone companies MSFTAAPL and the like have long term contracts to LOCK IN prices for their supply . Not_to mention MSFT and AAPL are already heavily in the AI game ... MUCH more than DELL is . EDIT Even HPQ hewlett packard is stockpiling memory to soften its blow which DELL has NOT_which is absurdly poor planning . Source During HP ’ s earnings call at the end of November HP CEO Enrique Lores expressed similar sentiments . Though Lores did say that the first half of 2026 should be okay for HP since the company currently has a memory stockpile . Bloomberg reported that Lenovo has also begun stockpiling PC memory to get through at least 2026 . Does Dell have this security or anything similar NOPE . Up until 2025 Dell has been known to have short term supply arrangements as its key strength . Now in late 2025 to all of 2026 ... its their Achilles tendon . The COO Jeff Clark of Dell stated “ We ’ re in a very unique time . It ’ s unprecedented . We have not_seen costs move at the rate that we ’ ve seen . And by the way it ’ s not_unique to DRAM it ’ s NAND . It is hard drives leading edge nodes across the semiconductor network ” he told analysts . “ I ’ d categorize it as demand is way ahead of supply and as we wade our way through that we ’ re going to lean on the things that we ’ ve always done. ” This is corporate speak for Oh shit oh shit oh shit . This wasnt supposed to happen . Oh god were so fuk And Dell has also noted it plans to raise the prices of their products by 1030 % to offset their costs . Heres the problem ... WHO IS PAYING 20 % more for Dell products Think about it ... would corporates or even individuals bite their tongue and pay 20 % premium for shiddy Dell laptops and PCs They have already laid off tens of thousands of employees they are not_in a position to easily fork over cash at a premium for bulk PCslaptops . There will be customers both corporate and individual who are more than willing to just let their existing hardware tough it out for 23 years until prices stabilize hopefully ... and thats IF they dont just look elsewhere . And personally I believe Dell wont stop at a 30 % increase . If these RAM prices continue to rise as they are Dell will have no_choice but to go farther beyond this . But what else CAN they do They dont have a strategy or countermeasure . This is the last resort when youre supply chain fucks you . As for the ISG side I admit Dells operating margins are improving quarter over quarter ... but this wont do much to outshine the pain CSG side is feeling . In the big picture their ISG side has a very very small margin for profitability . Its not_very profitable for them right now but they HAVE TO do it to stay relevant in the AI heavy economic environment we are in . But what if this is already priced in It is to a small extent Ill admit my thesis still holds that Wall street does not_fully foresee the horror show that will unfold when DELL releases their numbers in February . Add onto that because we dont foresee RAM shortage letting up in 20262027 but instead being just as bad or worse for future quarters ... They will have to mention that in upcoming guidance . How do the Insiders feel According to Quiver Quant Dell Technologies insiders have traded $ DELL stock on the open market 464 times in the past 6 months . Of those trades 0 have been purchases and 464 have been sales . Here ’ s a breakdown of recent trading of $ DELL stock by insiders over the last 6 months MICHAEL S DELL Chief Executive Officer has made 0 purchases and 2 sales selling 16253968 shares for an estimated $ 2222753260 . IV GP L.L.C . SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6315957 shares for an estimated $ 864817529 . V GP L.L.C . SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6315957 shares for an estimated $ 864817529 . WILLIAM D GREEN has made 0 purchases and 6 sales selling 272736 shares for an estimated $ 39695260 . ELLEN JAMISON KULLMAN sold 79806 shares for an estimated $ 12255009 WILLIAM F SCANNELL Pres . Glob . Sales Cust . Ops sold 91230 shares for an estimated $ 10803456 EGON DURBAN sold 71000 shares for an estimated $ 9806520 . . . External Considerations The fed already booted up QE The fed started reserve management purchases soft QE but its at a much smaller rate than before and only to short dated treasury bills . Beyond providing some health for smallcaps and unfucking the bond yield rates I dont see this affecting my play for Dell in any meaningful way . AI unwind This does not_rely on the AI Bubble or AI sentiment souring . If AI is dying through the market this will just be added headwind for Dell . What if the RAM Shortage Ends too soon to matter Its already happening and Dell is ALREADY feeling the pain ... moreso than others in its sector likely HPQ is going through the same but it doesnt seem to be have much meat left on the bones RAM production facilities are being built but will take years to start being operational to matter for this play . Positions 20x DELL Mar 20 2026 90 Put 80x DELL APR 17 2026 75 Put And I will be accumulating more as we get closer to their earnings in February Since Dells earnings is in February and Microns earnings will be in March i might flip my winningsif any between the 2 dates ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ >TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew told employees that the social media company and its parent, ByteDance Ltd., signed binding agreements to create a US joint venture majority-owned by American investors >In an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Chew said he was “pleased to share some great news” and said agreements with Oracle Corp., Silver Lake and MGX have been signed. Chew gave a closing date of Jan. 22, 2026. >“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” Chew said in the memo. Meanwhile, “TikTok global’s U.S. entitieswill manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing,” he wrote. >The memo outlined a deal that matched what the White House announced in September, which was pending approval from China. Chew’s memo does not mention China’s opinion on the transaction. It says 50% of the investors will be new, with Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment company, retaining 15% each; 30.1% will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance. >After more than a year of negotiations, Washington arranged a sale of the US arm of ByteDance’s popular video app to a consortium of investors. If finalized, the deal would remove a persistent issue in Beijing-Washington relations and signal progress in broader talks. But it would also deprive China’s most valuable private company of total control of an American social media phenomenon. >ByteDance’s coveted algorithms are considered central to TikTok’s business. Under the the deal proposed by Washington, ByteDance will license its AI recommendation technology to a newly created US TikTok entity, which will use the existing algorithm to retrain a new system that is secured by Oracle, TikTok’s cloud partner. >Trump’s TikTok Deal With China — What Do We Know?: QuickTake >The White House had dominated disclosures about the proposed arrangement, which was mandated on national security grounds by a law signed last year under the Joe Biden administration. US officials have expressed concern that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, and are worried that Beijing could use the app to collect data about US citizens or push specific narratives to Americans via the app’s recommendation algorithm. >Under the law, the initial deadline for the sell-or-ban rule was this past January, but Trump has extended this deadline multiple times since reentering office, most recently pushing it into January 2026.",

Given the fact that Microsoft Alphabet and Nvidia have reached a similar market cap . without spending so much on buybacks like Apple puts the question Tim Cook is a great CEO but is he really THAT great . Buybacks work as long as your business model is not_affected by changed narratives but with AI I am excited to see how Apple will emerge the technology ."

      "selftext": "Convenience is one of the few business models that stays powerful in any market. If you remove friction from a routine chore, usage tends to follow. That is the simplest way to understand the EzFill angle under NXXT. Per the EzFill website, the service brings fuel to your vehicle and is built around an app workflow: schedule in minutes, location pins, same day delivery options, and notifications when the job is done. What caught my eye is the stacking. It is not just fuel. The app also shows EZWash, which is basically the same idea applied to vehicle care. More convenience layers can mean more reasons for customers to stay inside one ecosystem rather than shop around each time. EzFill also states 4.8/5 app rating, 1M+ professional deliveries, and 10M+ gallons sold to date on its website. Those are execution claims worth verifying, but they frame this as a working operating business, not a concept pitch. If this is the entry point, the bigger question is whether convenience can drive repeat usage cheaply enough to support durable growth. Do your own research. Not financial advice.",

What caught my eye is the stacking . It is not_just fuel . The app also shows EZWash which is basically the same idea applied to vehicle care . More convenience layers can mean more reasons for customers to stay inside one ecosystem rather than shop around each time . EzFill also states 4.85 app rating 1M professional deliveries and 10M gallons sold to date on its website . Those are execution claims worth verifying but they frame this as a working operating business not_a concept pitch . If this is the entry point the bigger question is whether convenience can drive repeat usage cheaply enough to support durable growth . Do your own research . Not_financial advice ."

      "selftext": "I came across a news article that said CPI unexpectedly cooled in November. Is a weakening labor market the main culprit? The Consumer Price Index(CPI)rose2.7%annually in November,below estimates at 3.1%. Investors cheered the news as it could encourage the Fed to lower rates. Retailers are seeing consumers trade down to cheaper products. What does it mean for investors? Going into 2026,investors seem to be hoping for a Goldilocks economy,one where the economy isn’t so weak that it leads to a recession,but isn’t strong enough to keep inflation elevated. Ideally,for the stock market,inflation would continue to cool off,which would help the average consumer and could persuade the Fed to cut rates. Do you think that argument holds up?What’s your view on it?",

Right now I’m holding more money in cash (checking + HYSA) than I have invested in the market, and it’s starting to feel inefficient. I’ve been slowly deploying cash into investments, but I still feel very cash-heavy. Some context: • Roth IRA is maxed out (hit the limit back in September) • Contributing to a 401k and increasing contributions for next year • Any additional investing is going into low-cost index funds in a taxable brokerage, crypto and recently I got into silver. • I currently have about a 16-month emergency fund, which feels excessive given that my job feels very secure I know cash has its place, but sitting on more cash than invested capital at my age feels suboptimal. I’m planning to dump a good amount into my Roth as soon as 2026 opens up, but until then I’m unsure how aggressive I should be. Hypothetical question: If you had $180k total right now, how much would you keep in cash (checking/HYSA) versus put into investments? THANK YOU IN ADVANCE",

Right now I ’ m holding more money in cash checking HYSA than I have invested in the market and it ’ s starting to feel inefficient . I ’ ve been slowly deploying cash into investments but I still feel very cashheavy . Some context • Roth IRA is maxed out hit the limit back in September • Contributing to a 401k and increasing contributions for next year • Any additional investing is going into lowcost index funds in a taxable brokerage crypto and recently I got into silver . • I currently have about a 16month emergency fund which feels excessive given that my job feels very secure I know cash has its place but sitting on more cash than invested capital at my age feels suboptimal . I ’ m planning to dump a good amount into my Roth as soon as 2026 opens up but until then I ’ m unsure how aggressive I should be . Hypothetical question If you had $ 180k total right now how much would you keep in cash checkingHYSA versus put into investments THANK YOU IN ADVANCE"

      "selftext": "I’m 18, UK based. Just took control of a £50k+ portfolio I built from savings and side hustles (flipping golf clubs, designer stuff, bit of luck). It’s been with the same firm my parents use. They’re about wealth preservation, not growth. Best year I got \\~16% while the S&P 500 did \\~25%. Fees are 1% + 0.5% platform. I don’t even meet their usual client threshold but they still want to keep me, which feels off. My aim is long term: save hard, compound, hit my financial goal at 45. With steady contributions and \\~7.5% returns after fees, it’s doable. Thinking of pulling it all out and going DIY passive. Options: * 80% S&P 500 / 20% Nasdaq (higher growth, higher risk) * 70% S&P 500 / 30% global index + a few stocks (more diversified, less tech heavy) I know people talk about an AI bubble but at my age I think I can ride it out. So: * Is all‑in S&P realistic for a UK investor long term? * Is Nasdaq worth the risk or better to diversify? * Any regrets from leaving wealth managers and going DIY index funds? Not after hype, just grounded experiences. Cheers.",

Then you got Sam Altman doing his best impression of Dr. Evil prebooking [40% of the world's DRAM]( wafers with money that has yet to be seen. I say all this to say, HBM/DRAM/flash has become the new oil for AI, and everyone is fighting over the same barrels. What I have come to notice is that real choke point isn’t just how much memory you can buy, it’s how efficiently you can use the memory you already have, and how fast you can shove bits between GPUs, DRAM pools, and SSDs without the copper plumbing melting down and draining power grids of every last drop of electricity they can possibly produce. In light of the RAM/SSD shortage, this has become a conversation about **finding solutions that can maximize the compute potential of the currently existing infrastructure to meet current AI demands** This is where POET’s photonic engines come in: they don’t manufacture a single RAM chip or SSD, but they act like adding extra lanes to the AI data highway, letting data centers squeeze more training and inference out of every scarce byte of HBM/DRAM/flash. **So POET has two main products:** [The Optical Interposer]( \\- think of this as an “optical motherboard tile/chiplet.” [Starlight]( \\- an external laser farm that feeds those tiles with light. Today’s optics usually look like this: * You’ve got a discrete transceiver module in a metal “gold box.” * Inside that box: lasers, modulators, drivers, receivers, lenses, fiber alignment, etc. * Every module is handheld, robot aligned, and tuned. Slow, expensive, power-hungry. POET’s interposer basically says fuck the gold box * They take silicon and III-V lasers and build everything into a flat wafer-scale platform. * Instead of doing micron-level alignment one module at a time, they pattern the waveguides in lithography and drop the chips on with cheap pick-and-place tools. * Fibers line up passively, so there's really no heavy and expensive manufacturing process involved * The parts on the interposer are configureable, so this gives hyperscalers flexibility to choose which components and tier of components they would like on the interposer. think of the interposer like a complex lego block and you can piece together whichever legos you want to it. To visualize, the interposer sits between the hot compute chips (GPUs/ASICs/NPUs) and the outside world (network, memory pools, storage) and replaces a bunch of copper with light paths. **Starlight is more of a accessory to the interposer.** * Instead of putting hot, fragile lasers on the GPU/package, they park the lasers off to the side in a dedicated module. * That Starlight box pumps clean laser light over fiber into a bunch of POET interposer engines sitting near the compute. **The benefits are:** * Keeps lasers away from 700W space heaters (GB200, H100, etc.). * One laser farm can feed many engines instead of every module lugging its own lasers. * Better reliability, easier maintenance, and lower $/bit because you share the light source across multiple links. **So together these two components work like this:** Starlight = shared light source Interposer = cheap, configurable, mass-produced optical engine tile that is easily scalable. This is probably the biggest sell for me on this product, as this gives hyperscalers more flexibility to customize the interposer **So how is different from the other companies that offer a photonics solution?** Most of the big incumbents (Broadcom, Coherent, Lumentum, etc.) are still: * Shipping discrete pluggable modules (400G/800G, etc.). * Using a lot of active alignment and labor-intensive packaging. * Typically putting lasers inside every module, which: * Wastes power * Adds heat right where you don’t want it * Doesn’t scale nicely to 1.6T / 3.2T and giant AI fabrics. **POET’s edge vs “generic” silicon photonics:** * Wafer-scale, passive alignment which lowers capex, lowers assembly cost, and is easier to ramp volume. * Allows hybrid integration: can mix and match best-of-breed lasers with silicon in one platform. * Remote lasers (Starlight) which results in fewer total lasers and less heat on the package. And if you're wondering if any of this technology has even been validated, look no further than Marvell Technologies, [who purchased one of POET's largest customers]( Celestial AI, for up to $5+ billion. Marvell's main reason for acquiring Celestial AI was for its Photonic Fabric, an optical interconnect architecture that is built atop POET's Optical Interposer and uses POET’s Starlight as a remote laser source. In other words, a serious, blue-chip semi company and at least one hyperscaler ([AWS](#google_vignette)) have already done the homework on this architecture and decided it’s real enough to bet billions and multi-year roadmaps on. You don’t build a next-gen AI fabric around external lasers and wafer-scale photonics if you’re not confident the vendors in that stack can actually meet the eye diagrams, BER targets, thermal budgets, and manufacturing yields you need at hyperscale. The Marvell/Celestial deal is basically the the big dawgs in the room saying: “Yes, this class of photonic solution is how we’re going to attack the I/O wall.” Also, Celestial AI's CEO, [David Lazovsky]( was the Executive Chairman at POET How does any of this actually help with the RAM/SSD shortage? POET obviously doesn’t fab a single DRAM chip or SSD, so the way they solve the shortage is indirect, but very real: they change the economics of how much useful work you can squeeze out of every byte of memory and every GPU you already own. Right now, hyperscalers are in a ridiculous situation. They’re paying insane prices for HBM, DRAM, and enterprise SSDs, but a lot of that capacity is effectively stranded. You have GPUs sitting on islands of local HBM, servers with their own DRAM, storage boxes full of flash, and the copper between them can’t move data fast enough. So to keep latency acceptable, the big guys end up replicating the same data all over the place, sharding models, caching datasets on every node, and overbuilding memory just so the network doesn’t become a brick wall. That’s fine when RAM is cheap. It’s a killer when HBM/DRAM/flash prices are up 200% over the last month. On the power side, POET’s own FAQ for their 800G/1.6T engines spells out that by using directly modulated lasers and getting rid of extra modulators, wirebonds, and gearbox/DSP overhead, they can cut about **6–8 watts of power per module** versus conventional approaches at these speeds. Six to eight watts doesn’t sound like much until you remember you’re not deploying one module, you’re deploying thousands. At 10,000 modules across a big AI cluster, that’s **60–80 kW of power and cooling you’re not wasting just on the optics layer.** That “freed” power budget can either lower your overall TCO or be reallocated to more GPUs and more memory in the same rack/power envelope. Then there’s cost. In their Starlight FAQ, POET flat-out says that for Celestial AI, the Starlight external light source is expected to be **up to 75% cheaper than comparable light sources on the market**, thanks to the Optical Interposer’s lower bill of materials and wafer level assembly. Cheap optics are what allow hyperscalers to overspec bandwidth relative to memory, which is exactly what you want when memory itself is the constrained resource. There’s also a quiet supply angle baked in: their 1.6T transmitter is the first to efficiently use an electroabsorption modulated laser array in this way, and POET explicitly calls out that it gives a “dramatic capacity increase” for Indium Phosphide electroabsorption modulated lasers at a time when the industry is facing shortages of those lasers. In other words, they’re not just stretching HBM/DRAM/SSD; they’re also stretching scarce laser capacity on the photonics side by packing more usable throughput per laser device. **Put that together in plain English: a single POET-based engine gives you terabit-class bandwidth in a tiny footprint, saves you several watts per port at 800G/1.6T, cuts your light source cost by as much as three-quarters, and increases the amount of traffic you can push per scarce laser. That’s what makes it a lever against the memory/SSD shortages. this results in:** * **GPUs spend more time actually computing instead of waiting on I/O.** * **You need fewer duplicate copies of data sprayed across the cluster just to hide latency.** * **You can justify architecting shared memory pools and far-flash tiers because the fabric is fast and efficient enough to make them usable.** So in a world where HBM/DRAM/SSD are the new oil and the barrels are sold out years in advance, POET’s pitch is basically: “Let us give you 1.6 Tbps-class optical engines that burn 6–8 W less per port and slash light-source cost by up to 75%, so you can stop wasting the obscenely expensive memory you already have.” This ultimately maximizes the compute potential of the present AI infrastructure to meet current AI demands and lessens the reliance on more compute power and SSD/RAM. **TL;DR** AI has turned HBM/DRAM/flash into the new oil. Prices are ripping, supply is pre-sold years out, and hyperscalers still can’t get all the memory they want – but the real choke point now is how efficiently they can use the insanely expensive RAM/SSD they already have and how fast they can move data between GPUs, DRAM pools, and storage. POET attacks that bottleneck: its Optical Interposer replaces bulky “gold box” optics with a wafer-scale, Lego-style optical tile, and its Starlight module moves the lasers off the hot GPU package into a shared external laser farm, making high-bandwidth links cheaper, cooler, and easier to scale. That lets photonic fabrics deliver terabit-class bandwidth, cut power and light-source cost, and reduce stranded/duplicated data, so you get more training and inference per GPU and per GB of HBM/DRAM/SSD instead of just brute-forcing with more hardware. In a world where memory is scarce and pre-booked, POET doesn’t make bytes – it makes the plumbing that squeezes more value out of every byte, and the Marvell–Celestial AI deal is the big-cap validation that this external-laser, photonic-fabric path is actually where hyperscalers are headed. **Position:** Edit: Interesting Statement: “Dave Brown, Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services at AWS, commented on Marvell’s acquisition of Celestial AI in their official announcement, stating: “At AWS, we aim to be at the forefront of major technology inflections, and we believe optical interconnects will play an important role in the future of AI infrastructure. Building a scalable, high-performance, and power-efficient cloud starts with an approach built upon differentiated technologies. Celestial AI has made impressive progress, and we expect their combination with a large-scale semiconductor company like Marvell will help further accelerate optical scale-up innovation for next-generation AI deployments.””",

      "selftext_processed": "Were all fully aware of whats going on with the supply chain shortages on RAM and SSD . Kingston sent out a warning stating that NAND costs are up 246 % since early 2025 and says RAMSSD prices are likely to keep rising through 2026 rather than come back down . SK Hynix is telling investors that the global memory shortage could drag on until 2028 even as they and Samsung print multi year high profits on AI memory . NAND suppliers are already reporting that their 2026 enterprise SSD allocations are basically sold out with doubledigit price hikes locked in . On top of this hyperscalers are only getting about 70 % of the server DRAM they order even after accepting contract price increases of up to 50 % in a single quarter . Then you got Sam Altman doing his best impression of Dr . Evil prebooking 40 % of the worlds DRAM wafers with money that has yet to be seen . I say all this to say HBMDRAMflash has become the new oil for AI and everyone is fighting over the same barrels . What I have come to notice is that real choke point isn ’ t just how much memory you can buy it ’ s how efficiently you can use the memory you already have and how fast you can shove bits between GPUs DRAM pools and SSDs without the copper plumbing melting down and draining power grids of every last drop of electricity they can possibly produce . In light of the RAMSSD shortage this has become a conversation about finding solutions that can maximize the compute potential of the currently existing infrastructure to meet current AI demands This is where POET ’ s photonic engines come in they don ’ t manufacture a single RAM chip or SSD but they act like adding extra lanes to the AI data highway letting data centers squeeze more training and inference out of every scarce byte of HBMDRAMflash . So POET has two main products The Optical Interposer think of this as an “ optical motherboard tilechiplet. ” Starlight an external laser farm that feeds those tiles with light . Today ’ s optics usually look like this You ’ ve got a discrete transceiver module in a metal “ gold box. ” Inside that box lasers modulators drivers receivers lenses fiber alignment etc . Every module is handheld robot aligned and tuned . Slow expensive powerhungry . POET ’ s interposer basically says fuck the gold box They take silicon and IIIV lasers and build everything into a flat waferscale platform . Instead of doing micronlevel alignment one module at a time they pattern the waveguides in lithography and drop the chips on with cheap pickandplace tools . Fibers line up passively so theres really no_heavy and expensive manufacturing process involved The parts on the interposer are configureable so this gives hyperscalers flexibility to choose which components and tier of components they would like on the interposer . think of the interposer like a complex lego block and you can piece together whichever legos you want to it . To visualize the interposer sits between the hot compute chips GPUsASICsNPUs and the outside world network memory pools storage and replaces a bunch of copper with light paths . Starlight is more of a accessory to the interposer . Instead of putting hot fragile lasers on the GPUpackage they park the lasers off to the side in a dedicated module . That Starlight box pumps clean laser light over fiber into a bunch of POET interposer engines sitting near the compute . The benefits are Keeps lasers away from 700W space heaters GB200 H100 etc .. One laser farm can feed many engines instead of every module lugging its own lasers . Better reliability easier maintenance and lower $ bit because you share the light source across multiple links . So together these two components work like this Starlight shared light source Interposer cheap configurable massproduced optical engine tile that is easily scalable . This is probably the biggest sell for me on this product as this gives hyperscalers more flexibility to customize the interposer So how is different from the other companies that offer a photonics solution Most of the big incumbents Broadcom Coherent Lumentum etc . are still Shipping discrete pluggable modules 400G800G etc .. Using a lot of active alignment and laborintensive packaging . Typically putting lasers inside every module which Wastes power Adds heat right where you don ’ t want it Doesn ’ t scale nicely to 1.6T 3.2T and giant AI fabrics . POET ’ s edge vs “ generic ” silicon photonics Waferscale passive alignment which lowers capex lowers assembly cost and is easier to ramp volume . Allows hybrid integration can mix and match bestofbreed lasers with silicon in one platform . Remote lasers Starlight which results in fewer total lasers and less heat on the package . And if youre wondering if any of this technology has even been validated look no_further than Marvell Technologies who purchased one of POETs largest customers Celestial AI for up to $ 5 billion . Marvells main reason for acquiring Celestial AI was for its Photonic Fabric an optical interconnect architecture that is built atop POETs Optical Interposer and uses POET ’ s Starlight as a remote laser source . In other words a serious bluechip semi company and at least one hyperscaler AWSgoogle_vignette have already done the homework on this architecture and decided it ’ s real enough to bet billions and multiyear roadmaps on . You don ’ t build a nextgen AI fabric around external lasers and waferscale photonics if you ’ re not_confident the vendors in that stack can actually meet the eye diagrams BER targets thermal budgets and manufacturing yields you need at hyperscale . The MarvellCelestial deal is basically the the big dawgs in the room saying “ Yes this class of photonic solution is how we ’ re going to attack the IO wall. ” Also Celestial AIs CEO David Lazovsky was the Executive Chairman at POET How does any of this actually help with the RAMSSD shortage POET obviously doesn ’ t fab a single DRAM chip or SSD so the way they solve the shortage is indirect but very real they change the economics of how much useful work you can squeeze out of every byte of memory and every GPU you already own . Right now hyperscalers are in a ridiculous situation . They ’ re paying insane prices for HBM DRAM and enterprise SSDs but a lot of that capacity is effectively stranded . You have GPUs sitting on islands of local HBM servers with their own DRAM storage boxes full of flash and the copper between them can ’ t move data fast enough . So to keep latency acceptable the big guys end up replicating the same data all over the place sharding models caching datasets on every node and overbuilding memory just so the network doesn ’ t become a brick wall . That ’ s fine when RAM is cheap . It ’ s a killer when HBMDRAMflash prices are up 200 % over the last month . On the power side POET ’ s own FAQ for their 800G1.6T engines spells out that by using directly modulated lasers and getting rid of extra modulators wirebonds and gearboxDSP overhead they can cut about 6–8 watts of power per module versus conventional approaches at these speeds . Six to eight watts doesn ’ t sound like much until you remember you ’ re not_deploying one module you ’ re deploying thousands . At 10000 modules across a big AI cluster that ’ s 60–80 kW of power and cooling you ’ re not_wasting just on the optics layer . That “ freed ” power budget can either lower your overall TCO or be reallocated to more GPUs and more memory in the same rackpower envelope . Then there ’ s cost . In their Starlight FAQ POET flatout says that for Celestial AI the Starlight external light source is expected to be up to 75 % cheaper than comparable light sources on the market thanks to the Optical Interposer ’ s lower bill of materials and wafer level assembly . Cheap optics are what allow hyperscalers to overspec bandwidth relative to memory which is exactly what you want when memory itself is the constrained resource . There ’ s also a quiet supply angle baked in their 1.6T transmitter is the first to efficiently use an electroabsorption modulated laser array in this way and POET explicitly calls out that it gives a “ dramatic capacity increase ” for Indium Phosphide electroabsorption modulated lasers at a time when the industry is facing shortages of those lasers . In other words they ’ re not_just stretching HBMDRAMSSD they ’ re also stretching scarce laser capacity on the photonics side by packing more usable throughput per laser device . Put that together in plain English a single POETbased engine gives you terabitclass bandwidth in a tiny footprint saves you several watts per port at 800G1.6T cuts your light source cost by as much as threequarters and increases the amount of traffic you can push per scarce laser . That ’ s what makes it a lever against the memorySSD shortages . this results in GPUs spend more time actually computing instead of waiting on IO . You need fewer duplicate copies of data sprayed across the cluster just to hide latency . You can justify architecting shared memory pools and farflash tiers because the fabric is fast and efficient enough to make them usable . So in a world where HBMDRAMSSD are the new oil and the barrels are sold out years in advance POET ’ s pitch is basically “ Let us give you 1.6 Tbpsclass optical engines that burn 6–8 W less per port and slash lightsource cost by up to 75 % so you can stop wasting the obscenely expensive memory you already have. ” This ultimately maximizes the compute potential of the present AI infrastructure to meet current AI demands and lessens the reliance on more compute power and SSDRAM . TLDR AI has turned HBMDRAMflash into the new oil . Prices are ripping supply is presold years out and hyperscalers still can ’ t get all the memory they want – but the real choke point now is how efficiently they can use the insanely expensive RAMSSD they already have and how fast they can move data between GPUs DRAM pools and storage . POET attacks that bottleneck its Optical Interposer replaces bulky “ gold box ” optics with a waferscale Legostyle optical tile and its Starlight module moves the lasers off the hot GPU package into a shared external laser farm making highbandwidth links cheaper cooler and easier to scale . That lets photonic fabrics deliver terabitclass bandwidth cut power and lightsource cost and reduce strandedduplicated data so you get more training and inference per GPU and per GB of HBMDRAMSSD instead of just bruteforcing with more hardware . In a world where memory is scarce and prebooked POET doesn ’ t make bytes – it makes the plumbing that squeezes more value out of every byte and the Marvell–Celestial AI deal is the bigcap validation that this externallaser photonicfabric path is actually where hyperscalers are headed . Position Edit Interesting Statement “ Dave Brown Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services at AWS commented on Marvell ’ s acquisition of Celestial AI in their official announcement stating “ At AWS we aim to be at the forefront of major technology inflections and we believe optical interconnects will play an important role in the future of AI infrastructure . Building a scalable highperformance and powerefficient cloud starts with an approach built upon differentiated technologies . Celestial AI has made impressive progress and we expect their combination with a largescale semiconductor company like Marvell will help further accelerate optical scaleup innovation for nextgeneration AI deployments . ” ”"

      "selftext": "Been investing for years, but I went all in on options (mostly TSLA and CVNA puts) earlier this year. Big mistake. Wiped out almost my entire account. Down from $120k to $5k in a matter of weeks. Turns out I have a bit of a gambling problem, so options aren’t a good idea for me. Went back to basics: aka penny stocks. I’ve got a lot of experience (good and bad) with small caps, and decided to only focus on buying and holing long after doing extensive DD. Only issue is I didn’t have cash to play with. Fortunately I had excellent credit on account of always auto paying credit cards and never taking out loans. So I called up all the financial institutions I had banked with and asked them for the biggest loans they would give me. This turned out to only be about $30k, which wasn’t enough, so I set my credit cards to interest only payments and started taking out cash advances. After a few months of this I maxed out around $80k in debt. I knew this was dumb, but fuck it! Somehow things panned out pretty well, and as of today I have finally broken even! What’s next: I’m going to keep rolling with this strategy, but will pair down the debt significantly. Mainly just the credit card debt, with a target around $20k debt, which at 25% utilization should be enough to get my credit score moving up again. Once I hit $500k, I’ll clear the debt fully. Takeaways: \\- Don’t short meme stocks \\- Short term options are not worth the risk \\- Learn from your mistakes and seek help \\- Loans are hard to get when you need them most For those who have a keen eye wondering why I already had losses prior to 2025, I sold my portfolio at another broker and moved it all into my current account in 2024. Moved it all over to my current account just to save transaction fees when punting it all on TSLA puts. Shockingly, the lower fees didn’t help much. \\-------- EDIT ---------- Seeing a lot of people saying they're in a similar position to me, so just to be clear: **I got lucky, and risked blowing my account up beyond repair. If you're in a similar position, please seek help** through Gamblers Anonymous or some other addition specialist. If you've had similar losses, you're almost certainly also a gambling addict, and the best thing you can do is get help for that before anything else.",

GLD is also full to the brim probably be pumped and dumped again once it hits 410, along with all shelter miners. Crypto-adjacent securities are not surging because crypto is still limp. Now yen is getting stronger, dollar getting cheaper, and cheap dollars are used to pump the same securities, and institutionals just swing trade from one earning call to the next. Nomura and Mizuho (ADRs) NMR / MFG are incredibly undervalued, two of the three top-tier Japanese banks, and these are the direct beneficiaries of a stronger yen and rising interest rates, and crafters of these new policies. They are two of the biggest corporate lenders and behind the first government-backed crypto stable yen, which basically means state-adjacent crypto finance from big lenders... the potential is quite huge. Nomura owns roughly half of Morgan Stanley, which still gets ignored. NMR’s financial division made a billion dollars using QQQ puts. NMR’s dividend yield is higher than most so-called dividend princesses or whatever the name is. MS has stated they want to do a USD stable coin, and NMR is the reason for that. They’ve been moving slowly in the ADRs, and have been two of my great portfolio shelters during this shit year. Price action alone (USD/JPY echange rate) is making this change, higher yen and lower dollar means you are effectively now buying more for less. Their share buybacks have turned very aggressive, and once the stable yen goes fully online worldwide and the USD version is also online, the deranged fantasy of getting cheap low-interest crypto insta loans send yen using a shit broker account to pay your shit mortgage or repay loans or flip exchange rates interests... will be not only a reality, but a practice.",

GLD is also full to the brim probably be pumped and dumped again once it hits 410 along with all shelter miners . Cryptoadjacent securities are not_surging because crypto is still limp . Now yen is getting stronger dollar getting cheaper and cheap dollars are used to pump the same securities and institutionals just swing trade from one earning call to the next . Nomura and Mizuho ADRs NMR MFG are incredibly undervalued two of the three toptier Japanese banks and these are the direct beneficiaries of a stronger yen and rising interest rates and crafters of these new policies . They are two of the biggest corporate lenders and behind the first governmentbacked crypto stable yen which basically means stateadjacent crypto finance from big lenders ... the potential is quite huge . Nomura owns roughly half of Morgan Stanley which still gets ignored . NMR ’ s financial division made a billion dollars using QQQ puts . NMR ’ s dividend yield is higher than most socalled dividend princesses or whatever the name is . MS has stated they want to do a USD stable coin and NMR is the reason for that . They ’ ve been moving slowly in the ADRs and have been two of my great portfolio shelters during this shit year . Price action alone USDJPY echange rate is making this change higher yen and lower dollar means you are effectively now buying more for less . Their share buybacks have turned very aggressive and once the stable yen goes fully online worldwide and the USD version is also online the deranged fantasy of getting cheap lowinterest crypto insta loans send yen using a shit broker account to pay your shit mortgage or repay loans or flip exchange rates interests ... will be not_only a reality but a practice ."

      "selftext": "I bought a bunch the last two days. These low prices are purely political. Turmp is close with MBS. They have been trading geopolitical favors for a while. Trump wants oil low, inflation down, MBS has been pumping despite the low prices. Usually this is when OPEC+ will turn it down. China has benefitted from the Venezuela, Russia, and Iran sanctions for years buying all their sanctioned oil on the discount. It’s not a huge amount, but taking their Venezuela 🇻🇪 production off the market will cause a disruption in this “private” market they have been stocking up on. If China has to start buying in the open market, oil prices are pretty inelastic on the short term. My average costs is $56.55 after averaging down some more today. Still have some limit orders if it drops more and will continue to load up. Quick math but I I own (65 contracts x $6 07 x 9x leverage per contract ) That’s like $355,000 of oil futures. It’s a lot of fun with the leverage! 1% in either directions and it’s like $5-10k. 🥭 might go on TV, nuke the Venezuela tankers, and we see a 2-3% movement no problem. This is any easy play. I have 3 months to wait this this out for a $20,000-30,000 gain if it hit $60+",

      "selftext_processed": "I bought a bunch the last two days . These low prices are purely political . Turmp is close with MBS . They have been trading geopolitical favors for a while . Trump wants oil low inflation down MBS has been pumping despite the low prices . Usually this is when OPEC will turn it down . China has benefitted from the Venezuela Russia and Iran sanctions for years buying all their sanctioned oil on the discount . It ’ s not_a huge amount but taking their Venezuela 🇻🇪 production off the market will cause a disruption in this “ private ” market they have been stocking up on . If China has to start buying in the open market oil prices are pretty inelastic on the short term . My average costs is $ 56.55 after averaging down some more today . Still have some limit orders if it drops more and will continue to load up . Quick math but I I own 65 contracts x $ 6 07 x 9x leverage per contract That ’ s like $ 355000 of oil futures . It ’ s a lot of fun with the leverage 1 % in either directions and it ’ s like $ 510k . 🥭 might go on TV nuke the Venezuela tankers and we see a 23 % movement no_problem . This is any easy play . I have 3 months to wait this this out for a $ 2000030000 gain if it hit $ 60"
