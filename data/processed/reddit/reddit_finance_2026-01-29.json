      "selftext": "Not sure if this breaks the rules, sorry in advance **My investing history as a 16yr old** **2019:** Spent 200$ on paydirt, ended up with about a gram of gold which was 60$ at the time. Contemplated buying a ounce of gold but never went through with it. (should have just bought pure 24k gold) Also thought about buying silver but never saw any potential. **2022:** Started buying stocks. Didnt really make anything **2024:** Started actually investing in stocks. Bought some stocks and ended up making a few hundred bucks. Also lost a couple hundred bucks. Took a break for a little while. **2025:** Got back into stocks around the end of summer. Bought some MPWR when it was at around 590$ in January but sold in February after it started dropping and was at a strong selling point, only made like 30$. Also bought a few TSLA shares and made a good bit of change when it hit 400$. Bought and sold a few things here and there, didn't really make much and ended taking another break for a few months. Eventually bought a whole share (6.5 shares after split) of netflix at 1.16k (116$ after split) right before the 10 to 1 split expecting a rise in buyers only for it to slowly drop in price. Thought about buying META (650$ - 660$), MPWR (900 - 950$), and TSLA (450 -480$) but decided not to since none of them had dropped, and for the most part they were going up. **2026:** Fast forward to today, held on to netflix since the split but the WB deal has drained -27% of my shares, gold is at 5.5k per ounce (genuinely insane), silver is 120$ per ounce (also insane), MPWR is at 1.16k right now, META is at 713$ (a 6.6% increase in after hours), TSLA is at 430$ right now, and NFLX is at 84$ right now. Overall: Should have bought gold bars Should have stuck with MPWR Should have bought META Shouldn't have doubted the power of silver Shouldn't have bought TSLA Should have 100% done more research.",

      "selftext": "Hello, I thought I would make 2026 my year for investing. I am tackling it 3 ways. 1. Back in May of 2024 I took advantage of a Schwab deal to match $100 when creating a new account and depositing $100. Not sure if I chose it or not, but they put the $100+$100 in some mixed tech stock. Google, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft. From then until now the $200 grew to $268.12. 2. To dabble in Crypto mining, I bought a couple small miners to mine Zcash. Seems it was one of the tokens that was showing some growth but got whacked with the developers all quit, but it seems to be hanging in there. They have been mining less than a month and have earned .06 ZEC, ie, about $21. I am probably losing money due to electricity cost, but they are heating my house :) I intend to move them to my off-grid property where I have a solar array and having already made the investment, basically free electricity. It will take a long time just to recoup the hardware cost, but that is already money down the drain. 3. I took advantage of a Rakuten $150 CB by opening a Kraken account and needing to spend $200 within a month. I just bought $210 worth of BTC which had a $3.10 fee. Will have to wait for the $150 CB. On the surface, my senile mind thinks the Schwab investment has the best potential unless crypto starts doing something. I realize these are piddling amounts and pocket change to you guys, but it is a start. I suspect my 36a of off-grid property in AZ was my best purchase. Are you guys on team crypto, or team stocks, or perhaps team real estate? I am going to forge ahead with mining crypto as the hardware investment was made, and I couldn't pass up the CB on the Kraken account, but not sure where I should move the money? Thoughts? Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello I thought I would make 2026 my year for investing . I am tackling it 3 ways . 1 . Back in May of 2024 I took advantage of a Schwab deal to match $ 100 when creating a new account and depositing $ 100 . Not_sure if I chose it or not_but they put the $ 100 $ 100 in some mixed tech stock . Google Apple Nvidia Amazon and Microsoft . From then until now the $ 200 grew to $ 268.12 . 2 . To dabble in Crypto mining I bought a couple small miners to mine Zcash . Seems it was one of the tokens that was showing some growth but got whacked with the developers all quit but it seems to be hanging in there . They have been mining less than a month and have earned .06 ZEC ie about $ 21 . I am probably losing money due to electricity cost but they are heating my house I intend to move them to my offgrid property where I have a solar array and having already made the investment basically free electricity . It will take a long time just to recoup the hardware cost but that is already money down the drain . 3 . I took advantage of a Rakuten $ 150 CB by opening a Kraken account and needing to spend $ 200 within a month . I just bought $ 210 worth of BTC which had a $ 3.10 fee . Will have to wait for the $ 150 CB . On the surface my senile mind thinks the Schwab investment has the best potential unless crypto starts doing something . I realize these are piddling amounts and pocket change to you guys but it is a start . I suspect my 36a of offgrid property in AZ was my best purchase . Are you guys on team crypto or team stocks or perhaps team real estate I am going to forge ahead with mining crypto as the hardware investment was made and I couldnt pass up the CB on the Kraken account but not_sure where I should move the money Thoughts Thanks"

      "selftext": "hola fella regards. ever wanted to see what the analysts downgraded your favourite stock really has to say about why they shat all over it, without having spend the nearly $100k that most sell-side shops expect you to pay for their shitty reports? DBS has you covered! here's the method 1. search up the stock ticker of the company you want with \"equity research filetype:pdf\" on google. scroll a bit down, and you'll eventually be able to find the most recent DBS report available regarding the stock. [for example, just searching up \"CVX equity reseach filetype:pdf\" got me the report they published literally 2 days ago on chevron]( 2. once you're there, press the web address and change it from the company you had before to another company you wanted to look at. using the chevron example, you change it from [ to [ by just by changing that last part at the end (make sure to capitalize it!) i have no idea what type of [security pre-cautions]( DBS has employed, but nearly every mega-cap that they have covered is literally publicly available for anyone to see. for example... **mag 7 coverage from DBS** Tesla - [ Meta - [ Apple - [ Google - [ Nvidia - [ Amazon - [ Microsoft - [ yep... they all work and literally all the most recent reports they have available. you know... the same analyst reports that wall street firms pay hundreds of thousands to get continuous access too. i honestly have no idea when they're going to patch this up but this is too fucking hilarious not to bring up. if you've ever wanted to see how the people paid to lose money think when it comes to earnings... here's your shot. **edit: i've managed to find that these motherfuckers somehow manage to not only publish their analyst reports, but whole industry and sectors reports that are actually more detailed than a \"report\" analysts shit out when they need to justify upgrading or downgrading. all you need to do is search \"industry dbs filetype:pdf\"** technology outlook: [ 2026 outlook: [ weekly macro insights from their chief economist (link auto-downloads the pdf): [google

      "selftext_processed": "hola fella regards . ever wanted to see what the analysts downgraded your favourite stock really has to say about why they shat all over it without having spend the nearly $ 100k that most sellside shops expect you to pay for their shitty reports DBS has you covered heres the method 1. search up the stock ticker of the company you want with equity research filetypepdf on google . scroll a bit down and youll eventually be able to find the most recent DBS report available regarding the stock . for example just searching up CVX equity reseach filetypepdf got me the report they published literally 2 days ago on chevron 2. once youre there press the web address and change it from the company you had before to another company you wanted to look at . using the chevron example you change it from to by just by changing that last part at the end make sure to capitalize it i have no_idea what type of security precautions DBS has employed but nearly every megacap that they have covered is literally publicly available for anyone to see . for example ... mag 7 coverage from DBS Tesla Meta Apple Google Nvidia Amazon Microsoft yep ... they all work and literally all the most recent reports they have available . you know ... the same analyst reports that wall street firms pay hundreds of thousands to get continuous access too . i honestly have no_idea when theyre going to patch this up but this is too fucking hilarious not_to bring up . if youve ever wanted to see how the people paid to lose money think when it comes to earnings ... heres your shot . edit ive managed to find that these motherfuckers somehow manage to not_only publish their analyst reports but whole industry and sectors reports that are actually more detailed than a

      "title": "OII - Subsea Robotics, Artic Supremacy, and the S Korean Retail Connection",
      "selftext": "OII has historically been an oil services company, but internally it has been making a much under-appreciated shift to an autonomy, robotics, and defense company. For subsea robotics they are considered the best compared to their peers. ased on recent news, my understanding is the most urgent needs for the the US military to address is: (a) US Navy build-out given that China ship-building capacity vastly out-strips the the US at this point, and they have been they have been making inroads in gaining control over critical global sea infrastructure across the world (note, this was the reason Venezuela mattered...Panama isthmus... oil is simply a means of saying this military incursion will not cost the taxpayer and it is also the reason why Greenland matters. (b) Reclaiming dominance in the Artic Circle, where China has been mapping the seafloor like mad. So bottom line is - US is completely dominant in Space, Missiles, and Air - but sea is more dicey than anything else. I expect spend going forward here to be very aggressive. So back to OII...compare is to OIH (oil services companies) and it trades basically in tandem with that. It also has an oil services multiple of \\~1x ev / sales and 5x ev / ebidtda. However what they call AdTech has long been the fastest growing segment. Here is some of what they are capable of. [ Now to the interesting part: The March DoD Contract. In March 2025 they received a Maritime Mobility System that they simply list as largest initial contract value in the company’s history. The specific dollar amount for that award remains undisclosed due to its sensitive nature with the U.S. Department of Defense. Note, this is a serious company, they make about 3b in rev a year. They don't play any games. In other words, there is no reason for them to play coy and tease shareholders. In Q1 2025, they stated AdTech margins took a hit as they took on readiness costs for this new contract. Bottom line, the company is making the shift from being a subcontractor (a \"part-maker\") to the lead company managing an entire military program - in one of the hottest and most urgent areas of DoD defense spend. What's this worth if the market views it as a robotics and defense pure play? What are the comps here? Well, right now the only decent comp is Kraken. Which is now a 2b ev off of \\~20m in quarterly rev. Again OII is only 3b ev against \\~750m in quarterly revenue. Kraken is looking a 27x / sales vs 1x sales for OII. I am not here to talk shit about Kraken. I think the company is great and could continue to rip. My point is simply this - the market is very, very thirsty for subsea military tech. So thirsty, they seem to form cults around them. This brings me to my other major points - the S Korean retail interest. From what I understand this is one of the most influential S Korean retail accounts.. Which is well deserved given the guy way beating the drum on RKLB consistently since early on. He rarely pitches new names, and when he does people sit up and listen. In this case, the OII post got about \\~200k views and very enthusiastic responses. After seeing what the S Koreans did to quantum, my general heuristic is - when they take an early interest in something I reach for the highest strikes possible. In sum, if this was given a reasonable multiple of 3x sales and 15x ebidtda, this would would be 3x on the commons...which given the modest IV would translate to \\~20x on a many of the strikes. And if this were to run to unreasonable valuations - which seems to be the case with the other subsea pure plays like Kraken and anything the S Korean retail takes a liking to, this could be bar none the trade of the year. Disclosure: I have call options from feb to july and strikes from 22.5 to 40.",

      "selftext_processed": "OII has historically been an oil services company but internally it has been making a much underappreciated shift to an autonomy robotics and defense company . For subsea robotics they are considered the best compared to their peers . ased on recent news my understanding is the most urgent needs for the the US military to address is a US Navy buildout given that China shipbuilding capacity vastly outstrips the the US at this point and they have been they have been making inroads in gaining control over critical global sea infrastructure across the world note this was the reason Venezuela mattered ... Panama isthmus ... oil is simply a means of saying this military incursion will not_cost the taxpayer and it is also the reason why Greenland matters . b Reclaiming dominance in the Artic Circle where China has been mapping the seafloor like mad . So bottom line is US is completely dominant in Space Missiles and Air but sea is more dicey than anything else . I expect spend going forward here to be very aggressive . So back to OII ... compare is to OIH oil services companies and it trades basically in tandem with that . It also has an oil services multiple of 1x ev sales and 5x ev ebidtda . However what they call AdTech has long been the fastest growing segment . Here is some of what they are capable of . Now to the interesting part The March DoD Contract . In March 2025 they received a Maritime Mobility System that they simply list as largest initial contract value in the company ’ s history . The specific dollar amount for that award remains undisclosed due to its sensitive nature with the U.S. Department of Defense . Note this is a serious company they make about 3b in rev a year . They dont play any games . In other words there is no_reason for them to play coy and tease shareholders . In Q1 2025 they stated AdTech margins took a hit as they took on readiness costs for this new contract . Bottom line the company is making the shift from being a subcontractor a partmaker to the lead company managing an entire military program in one of the hottest and most urgent areas of DoD defense spend . Whats this worth if the market views it as a robotics and defense pure play What are the comps here Well right now the only decent comp is Kraken . Which is now a 2b ev off of 20m in quarterly rev . Again OII is only 3b ev against 750m in quarterly revenue . Kraken is looking a 27x sales vs 1x sales for OII . I am not_here to talk shit about Kraken . I think the company is great and could continue to rip . My point is simply this the market is very very thirsty for subsea military tech . So thirsty they seem to form cults around them . This brings me to my other major points the S Korean retail interest . From what I understand this is one of the most influential S Korean retail accounts .. Which is well deserved given the guy way beating the drum on RKLB consistently since early on . He rarely pitches new names and when he does people sit up and listen . In this case the OII post got about 200k views and very enthusiastic responses . After seeing what the S Koreans did to quantum my general heuristic is when they take an early interest in something I reach for the highest strikes possible . In sum if this was given a reasonable multiple of 3x sales and 15x ebidtda this would would be 3x on the commons ... which given the modest IV would translate to 20x on a many of the strikes . And if this were to run to unreasonable valuations which seems to be the case with the other subsea pure plays like Kraken and anything the S Korean retail takes a liking to this could be bar none the trade of the year . Disclosure I have call options from feb to july and strikes from 22.5 to 40 ."

      "selftext": "MASSIVE bet on light beams AI is hitting a physical limit. Models are getting huge. To train them, you need thousands of chips working as one. But connecting them with copper wires creates heat and traffic jams. Marvell (MRVL fixes the plumbing. Marvell is profitable and growing earnings at 25%. It trades at 23x earnings. Broadcom trades at 35x for the same growth. That gap is a mistake. The real kicker is Celestial AI... Marvell is in the processing of acquiring them. Why? Because copper is hitting a wall. To make AI faster, you have to switch from electricity to light. Celestial AI builds “optical interconnects.” In plain English: they turn the traffic jam of electrical signals into a highway of light beams. This is the “Photonic Fabric.” It allows data to travel instantly between chips, solving the biggest bottleneck in AI scaling. This isn’t just an upgrade. It’s a new era of infrastructure. The numbers (Q3 fiscal year 2026)... Market Cap: \\~$68B Forward P/E: 23x Revenue: $2.075B Revenue Growth: >40% forecast for full year Non-GAAP gross margin: 59.7% Cash from operations: $582.3M 52-week high: $121.81 52-week low: $47.09 \\~ The risks… They rely heavily on a few massive cloud providers (like Amazon and Google). If one of them catches a cold, Marvell sneezes. Integrating a new acquisition like Celestial AI is never easy. They have to make the tech work at scale. If the broader tech market takes a hit or rates spike, high-growth stocks like this usually fall first. Bottom line… The market is looking at Marvell and seeing a “boring” backlog story. We look at Marvell and see critical infrastructure. Would love to hear others' pov on Marvell. Dan from Money Machine Newsletter",

But connecting them with copper wires creates heat and traffic jams . Marvell MRVL fixes the plumbing . Marvell is profitable and growing earnings at 25 % . It trades at 23x earnings . Broadcom trades at 35x for the same growth . That gap is a mistake . The real kicker is Celestial AI ... Marvell is in the processing of acquiring them . Why Because copper is hitting a wall . To make AI faster you have to switch from electricity to light . Celestial AI builds “ optical interconnects. ” In plain English they turn the traffic jam of electrical signals into a highway of light beams . This is the “ Photonic Fabric. ” It allows data to travel instantly between chips solving the biggest bottleneck in AI scaling . This isn ’ t just an upgrade . It ’ s a new era of infrastructure . The numbers Q3 fiscal year 2026 ... Market Cap $ 68B Forward PE 23x Revenue $ 2.075B Revenue Growth 40 % forecast for full year NonGAAP gross margin 59.7 % Cash from operations $ 582.3M 52week high $ 121.81 52week low $ 47.09 The risks… They rely heavily on a few massive cloud providers like Amazon and Google . If one of them catches a cold Marvell sneezes . Integrating a new acquisition like Celestial AI is never_easy . They have to make the tech work at scale . If the broader tech market takes a hit or rates spike highgrowth stocks like this usually fall first . Bottom line… The market is looking at Marvell and seeing a “ boring ” backlog story . We look at Marvell and see critical infrastructure . Would love to hear others pov on Marvell . Dan from Money Machine Newsletter"

I think Karp is a visionary. But as a value investor, I cannot make the math work. Here is the reality check. **1. The \"Reverse DCF\" (The Kill Shot)** Instead of guessing growth rates, I worked backward from the current price ($157) to see what the market is pricing in. * **The Requirement:** To justify $157 today, PLTR needs to grow Free Cash Flow at **51.5% annually for the next 10 years**. * **The Context:** Microsoft grew at \\~15% at scale. Amazon grew at \\~30%. * **The Bet:** You are betting that PLTR will grow **2x faster than Amazon** for a decade straight. That is statistically improbable. **2. The Dilution Problem (SBC)** The Bull case ignores Stock-Based Compensation. * PLTR has diluted shareholders by **\\~35%** over the last 5 years. * You aren't just buying the business; you are fighting a 3-4% annual headwind from dilution. Your slice of the pie gets smaller every year. **3. The Insider Signal** While retail investors are piling in, the people who know the company best are exiting. * **Fact:** CEO Alex Karp and Peter Thiel have sold **\\~$3 Billion** in stock recently. * When the visionary founders are selling billions, they are signaling that the price is \"full.\" **The Verdict: SELL / AVOID** My Blended Intrinsic Value comes in at **\\~$56** (vs Price of $157). This is a \"Growth Trap.\" If they miss earnings just once, or if growth slows to a \"normal\" 30%, the multiple compression will be violent (potential -60% drawdown). **Counter-thesis? Is there any mathematical way to justify 50% growth for 10 years, or is this pure sentiment?**",

The shift, which comes as ​a U.S. Senate committee is reviewing a price floor extended last year to MP Materials, marks a reversal from commitments made to industry and could set ‌Washington apart from G7 partners discussing some form of joint price support or related measures to bolster production of critical minerals used in electric vehicles, semiconductors, defense systems and consumer electronics. At a closed-door meeting earlier this ‌month hosted by a Washington think tank, two senior Trump officials told U.S. minerals executives that their projects would need to prove their financial independence without government price support, three attendees told Reuters. \"We're not here to prop you guys up,\" Audrey Robertson, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy and head of its Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation, told the executives. \"Don't come to us expecting that.\" Source:",

      "selftext": "Tesla said on Wednesday that it’s agreed to invest about $2 billion into Elon Musk’s xAI, which he launched almost three years ago as a prospective competitor to OpenAI. The share purchase was related to xAI’s $20 billion financing round announced earlier this month. The artificial intelligence startup is best known for developing Grok, an AI chatbot and image generator. “Tesla’s investment was made on market terms consistent with those previously agreed to by other investors in the financing round,” the company said in its fourth-quarter earnings report. When Musk formed xAI as a Nevada public benefit corporation in March 2023, he did so without immediately disclosing the existence the company to Tesla shareholders. He debuted xAI in July that year, and the company dropped the public benefit corporation and related commitments in 2024. Of late, xAI has been at the center of regulatory probes across the globe concerning Grok. A recent Grok release, integrated into X, had enabled the widespread creation and dissemination of deepfake explicit images, based on photos of real people without their consent. The European Commission recently initiated a formal probe, as did the California Department of Justice, and agencies in Australia, India, Ireland and France. Other countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, rapidly moved to suspend Grok until the company stops enabling mass production of content deemed illegal in their jurisdictions. Tesla includes Grok as a feature in some electric vehicle infotainment systems. In Tesla’s shareholder deck on Wednesday, the company said it had “entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment,” to begin “evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies.” Tesla said the investment is “subject to customary regulatory conditions with the expectation to close in Q1′2026.” Source: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Tesla said on Wednesday that it ’ s agreed to invest about $ 2 billion into Elon Musk ’ s xAI which he launched almost three years ago as a prospective competitor to OpenAI . The share purchase was related to xAI ’ s $ 20 billion financing round announced earlier this month . The artificial intelligence startup is best known for developing Grok an AI chatbot and image generator . “ Tesla ’ s investment was made on market terms consistent with those previously agreed to by other investors in the financing round ” the company said in its fourthquarter earnings report . When Musk formed xAI as a Nevada public benefit corporation in March 2023 he did so without immediately disclosing the existence the company to Tesla shareholders . He debuted xAI in July that year and the company dropped the public benefit corporation and related commitments in 2024 . Of late xAI has been at the center of regulatory probes across the globe concerning Grok . A recent Grok release integrated into X had enabled the widespread creation and dissemination of deepfake explicit images based on photos of real people without their consent . The European Commission recently initiated a formal probe as did the California Department of Justice and agencies in Australia India Ireland and France . Other countries including Malaysia and Indonesia rapidly moved to suspend Grok until the company stops enabling mass production of content deemed illegal in their jurisdictions . Tesla includes Grok as a feature in some electric vehicle infotainment systems . In Tesla ’ s shareholder deck on Wednesday the company said it had “ entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment ” to begin “ evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies. ” Tesla said the investment is “ subject to customary regulatory conditions with the expectation to close in Q1′2026. ” Source"

      "title": "The Missing Link in the Semiconductor Supply Chain: Canatu",
      "selftext": "I’ve been researching a small Finnish company called **Canatu**, and it’s one of the most interesting investments I’ve come across in a while. It’s not a semiconductor company, not an AI company, and not a software business. It sits much deeper in the stack, at a physical bottleneck the entire AI and advanced chip industry quietly depends on. ***Quick disclaimer:*** *this is a deep-tech, supply-chain-driven idea. It’s not a clean financial multiple story and it requires some comfort with semiconductor manufacturing and physics. If that’s not your thing, feel free to skip. Also, none of this is investment advice.* The core of the thesis is simple: advanced chips are now constrained by physics, not software. As chipmakers push toward smaller nodes using EUV lithography, the limiting factor is no longer design, but materials. When you push hundreds of watts of extreme ultraviolet light through a system measured in nanometers, even microscopic weaknesses become billion-dollar problems. At the center of this process is the photomask, the blueprint of the chip. To protect it from contamination, EUV machines use an ultra-thin membrane called a pellicle. If a single dust particle hits the mask, yield can collapse instantly. Pellicles are therefore mandatory, but existing silicon-based pellicles are approaching their physical limits as EUV power increases. This is where Canatu enters the picture. They’ve developed carbon-nanotube (CNT) pellicles that can withstand far higher heat, deform far less, and transmit more EUV light than conventional solutions. As EUV systems transition toward High-NA EUV, those properties shift from nice to have to necessary. What makes Canatu particularly interesting is that they don’t plan to become a huge centralized manufacturer. Instead, they’re trying to scale via a licensing + tool model: * Reactor sales (specialized production equipment) * Proprietary consumables (inputs needed to run the reactor) * Per-unit licensing fees (royalty for each pellicle produced) So the customer carries capex and scaling complexity, while Canatu captures recurring economics if the technology becomes standard. That model creates leverage because pellicles are consumables, not permanent components. As EUV power rises, pellicle lifetimes shorten and replacement frequency increases. Even if High-NA EUV is a minority of wafer volume, it can drive a majority of pellicle demand due to higher burn rate. From a market structure perspective, this looks less like a classic manufacturer and more like a materials toll booth embedded into EUV. Think ARM rather than Intel, or Entegris rather than TSMC. If chips are made on ASML machines, something must sit between the photons and the mask, and that something increasingly looks like CNT pellicles. There are also real validation signals. Canatu signed a licensing deal with FST, a Korean supplier often interpreted as a bridge into Samsung’s ecosystem. Management has referenced two major Asian semiconductor clients (commonly speculated as Samsung + TSMC). Semiconductor revenue already dominates their sales and has been growing quickly. One part of my research focused on modeling how pellicle demand scales as logic fabs gradually transition from Low-NA to High-NA EUV, because this is where the non-linear upside comes from. The key insight is that pellicle demand does not scale with wafer volume, but with exposure intensity. High-NA tools use higher source power, more EUV layers per wafer, and impose much harsher thermal stress on pellicles, which shortens their usable life. In practical terms, a High-NA scanner consumes pellicles several times faster than a Low-NA tool. When you combine a slow but steady increase in High-NA share with higher burn rates, you get a demand curve where a minority of wafers can drive a majority of pellicle consumption. Even under conservative assumptions, my model shows pellicle demand in leading-edge logic fabs growing multiples faster than wafer output itself as High-NA adoption progresses through the second half of the decade. This is still a small-cap (\\~€300M), listed on Nasdaq First North Finland, it is a SPAC, so some future dilution from warrants and earn-outs is expected. That said, I find the asymmetry compelling. This isn’t a bet on which AI company wins. It’s a bet that physics does not negotiate, and that when an industry hits hard material limits, small specialized suppliers can quietly become indispensable. I’m curious how others here view this kind of deep supply-chain infrastructure play, especially anyone with semiconductor or lithography experience. Happy to be challenged.",

It ’ s not_a semiconductor company not_an AI company and not_a software business . It sits much deeper in the stack at a physical bottleneck the entire AI and advanced chip industry quietly depends on . Quick disclaimer this is a deeptech supplychaindriven idea . It ’ s not_a clean financial multiple story and it requires some comfort with semiconductor manufacturing and physics . If that ’ s not_your thing feel free to skip . Also none of this is investment advice . The core of the thesis is simple advanced chips are now constrained by physics not_software . As chipmakers push toward smaller nodes using EUV lithography the limiting factor is no_longer design but materials . When you push hundreds of watts of extreme ultraviolet light through a system measured in nanometers even microscopic weaknesses become billiondollar problems . At the center of this process is the photomask the blueprint of the chip . To protect it from contamination EUV machines use an ultrathin membrane called a pellicle . If a single dust particle hits the mask yield can collapse instantly . Pellicles are therefore mandatory but existing siliconbased pellicles are approaching their physical limits as EUV power increases . This is where Canatu enters the picture . They ’ ve developed carbonnanotube CNT pellicles that can withstand far higher heat deform far less and transmit more EUV light than conventional solutions . As EUV systems transition toward HighNA EUV those properties shift from nice to have to necessary . What makes Canatu particularly interesting is that they don ’ t plan to become a huge centralized manufacturer . Instead they ’ re trying to scale via a licensing tool model Reactor sales specialized production equipment Proprietary consumables inputs needed to run the reactor Perunit licensing fees royalty for each pellicle produced So the customer carries capex and scaling complexity while Canatu captures recurring economics if the technology becomes standard . That model creates leverage because pellicles are consumables not_permanent components . As EUV power rises pellicle lifetimes shorten and replacement frequency increases . Even if HighNA EUV is a minority of wafer volume it can drive a majority of pellicle demand due to higher burn rate . From a market structure perspective this looks less like a classic manufacturer and more like a materials toll booth embedded into EUV . Think ARM rather than Intel or Entegris rather than TSMC . If chips are made on ASML machines something must sit between the photons and the mask and that something increasingly looks like CNT pellicles . There are also real validation signals . Canatu signed a licensing deal with FST a Korean supplier often interpreted as a bridge into Samsung ’ s ecosystem . Management has referenced two major Asian semiconductor clients commonly speculated as Samsung TSMC . Semiconductor revenue already dominates their sales and has been growing quickly . One part of my research focused on modeling how pellicle demand scales as logic fabs gradually transition from LowNA to HighNA EUV because this is where the nonlinear upside comes from . The key insight is that pellicle demand does not_scale with wafer volume but with exposure intensity . HighNA tools use higher source power more EUV layers per wafer and impose much harsher thermal stress on pellicles which shortens their usable life . In practical terms a HighNA scanner consumes pellicles several times faster than a LowNA tool . When you combine a slow but steady increase in HighNA share with higher burn rates you get a demand curve where a minority of wafers can drive a majority of pellicle consumption . Even under conservative assumptions my model shows pellicle demand in leadingedge logic fabs growing multiples faster than wafer output itself as HighNA adoption progresses through the second half of the decade . This is still a smallcap €300M listed on Nasdaq First North Finland it is a SPAC so some future dilution from warrants and earnouts is expected . That said I find the asymmetry compelling . This isn ’ t a bet on which AI company wins . It ’ s a bet that physics does not_negotiate and that when an industry hits hard material limits small specialized suppliers can quietly become indispensable . I ’ m curious how others here view this kind of deep supplychain infrastructure play especially anyone with semiconductor or lithography experience . Happy to be challenged ."

I am relatively new to actively managing my own investments, even though I was able to build a solid base through my 401k and through a ROTH conversion from a prior plan this was mostly managed for me through my old advisor and/or the 2060 retirement date that i just had all of my money in. I enjoy bouncing ideas around and understanding how different people think about portfolio construction, so I am hoping that I can do that here. I’ll also say upfront: Bogleheads, I respect the philosophy and the reminders that beating the market consistently is difficult, but I am hoping to avoid that debate here. Thank you in advance. All of my money is now with Fidelity. I recently switched from American Funds and have been happy so far, especially with the broader fund selection and the elimination of load fees. **Current balances:** * Roth IRA: \\~$90k * 401k: \\~$95k * Taxable (TOD): \\~$18k **Current allocations:** Roth IRA * 50% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 25% FDCPX 401(k) * 100% FDKLX (Target Date 2060) Taxable (TOD) * 65% FSELX * 25% FXAIX * 10% AGTHX (legacy holding from American Funds) I’m 32 and intentionally running a very aggressive strategy, but I’m starting to think more about diversification. I’m especially curious whether there are any non-tech or non-semiconductor funds that people feel have historically outperformed or provided strong long-term returns. I know I want to replace FDCPX, since it’s also tech-heavy and overlaps with FSELX, I am just not sure with what yet. I’ve also considered switching FCNTX to either FXAIX or FBGRX, but my hesitation is that FCNTX seems to have stronger lifetime performance than FXAIX and feels more complementary to FSELX than FBGRX, which appears more growth- and tech-concentrated. **Restructure plan as of now:** Roth IRA * 50% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 15% FSENX * 10% FFFCX 401(k) * 100% FDKLX (Target Date 2060) Taxable (TOD) * 40% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 20% FSENX * 10% AGTHX * 5% FFFCX I’m interested in hearing how others think about this - not necessarily what to do, but how to think about it, although I am open to some suggestions.",

      "selftext": "I’m newish to investing. I’m looking for something that I feel should exist but I can’t find it. I want to see what ETF component stocks affected today’s pricing change the most. Something like the top 10 positive contributors and the top 10 negative contributors by weight to that ETF. If, for instance, stock A is 5% of the ETF and it went up 8%, it would have contributed +0.4% to the fund’s performance. If stock B is 1% of the fund, and went down by 20%, it would have contributed -0.2%. So, if VOO is down, why? Did Nvidia drop a fair amount and everything else was stable, or did all the banks drop due to a regulation change, etc? I can find S&P 500 movers but, since they are not weighted, it doesn’t tell the story. Not to mention I am looking for this for any given ETF. Does this exist and my searches suck? Does this not exist because it’s solved another way?",

      "selftext": "I’ve been building my portfolio for a few years now, but with the current sentiment around an AI bubble, I’m starting to feel over-leveraged in tech. Currently sitting on about $70k total and looking for a sanity check on my risk management strategy. Portfolio Breakdown: • VOO: $30k (Taxable) • Tencent (TCEHY): $10k • Roth IRA: $20k (Broad market ETFs) • Misc: $10k in individual stocks The Concern: Between VOO’s heavy weighting in mag-seven/AI and my Tencent position, my exposure to a tech correction is significant. I’m trying to decide the best way to \"crash-proof\" without being an emotional seller. Specifically: 1. Stop-Losses vs. Hedging: Does anyone actually use limit sells/stop-losses for long-term holds like VOO, or is the risk of being \"stopped out\" during a flash dip too high? 2. The Tencent Position: It’s a large chunk of my individual holdings. Given the current macro environment, would you trim this to rotate into a more defensive sector? 3. Strategy: For those who think we are in a bubble, are you staying the course with the S&P 500, or are you moving toward a higher bond/cash position to buy a potential dip? Not looking to \"time the market\" perfectly, just want to ensure I'm not being reckless by holding through a potential 2000-style tech pop.",

Currently sitting on about $ 70k total and looking for a sanity check on my risk management strategy . Portfolio Breakdown • VOO $ 30k Taxable • Tencent TCEHY $ 10k • Roth IRA $ 20k Broad market ETFs • Misc $ 10k in individual stocks The Concern Between VOO ’ s heavy weighting in magsevenAI and my Tencent position my exposure to a tech correction is significant . I ’ m trying to decide the best way to crashproof without being an emotional seller . Specifically 1 . StopLosses vs . Hedging Does anyone actually use limit sellsstoplosses for longterm holds like VOO or is the risk of being stopped out during a flash dip too high 2 . The Tencent Position It ’ s a large chunk of my individual holdings . Given the current macro environment would you trim this to rotate into a more defensive sector 3 . Strategy For those who think we are in a bubble are you staying the course with the SP 500 or are you moving toward a higher bondcash position to buy a potential dip Not_looking to time the market perfectly just want to ensure Im not_being reckless by holding through a potential 2000style tech pop ."

To train and run large-scale AI, you also need: \\- Infrastructure (data centers, networking, cooling) \\- Energy (significant power to run the systems) This means that the economic upside isn’t limited to the big tech names. Mid and smaller cap companies in infrastructure and energy could see significant growth if AI adoption continues. AI is more then digital, it’s physical, capital-intensive, and energy-dependant. Do you think the real AI winners are the mega-caps everyone knows, or the broader stack of infrastructure and energy companies?",

Central banks are buying . Every dip is gobbled up by the banks . 3 . Dedollarization and debasement continues to increase the value . But why is it increasing such rapidly I have noticed the rapid increase after Trump Greenland threat Have western European nations started dumping dollar and buy gold I havent read anything about that ."

      "selftext": "The U.S. Department of Energy is significantly expanding efforts to secure and rebuild the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain to support both the existing reactor fleet and next-generation nuclear technologies. The DOE has awarded roughly $2.7 billion in long-term uranium enrichment contracts to boost U.S. production of low-enriched uranium and high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and strengthening energy security. Expanded domestic enrichment capacity is expected to underpin future reactor builds and improve fuel supply reliability across the nuclear sector, particularly as advanced reactor deployments move closer to commercialization. This initiative fits into a broader federal strategy to reinforce nuclear energy infrastructure through supply-chain investment and reactor deployment support. These policy moves have already driven investor interest in uranium and nuclear-adjacent equities, especially companies positioned along the fuel and advanced reactor value chain. For emerging developers like $OKLO, improved access to domestic enrichment and fuel fabrication capacity helps address one of the key bottlenecks facing advanced reactors, potentially de-risking timelines and improving long-term commercialization prospects.",

      "selftext": "Selling VUG in taxable account to rebalance I’m 27 and have about $27,000 in a taxable brokerage account with Robinhood. I was investing 50/30/20 in VOO/VUG/VXUS, and that is the current breakdown of my portfolio balance. I would like to now aim for a 70/30 split in VOO/VXUS as I am worried I am too leveraged into US large cap growth, especially with a looming tech bubble. My question is, should I: 1) sell off my VUG position and rebalance into VOO/VXUS since I have held the assets for more than a year and should be in the 15% capital gains bracket based on my standard income? 2) sell off VUG and put it into VTI instead of VOO to better hedge against the tech bubble pop, and keep investing in VTI going forward? 3) not touch VUG at all and just continue to invest in VOO/VXUS or VTI/VXUS moving forward? Best I can figure is about $150 in taxes from capital gains, which I think I can offset by tax loss harvesting a solo stock I bought years ago as a crap shoot that’s down $144. Is that all not worth it and should I just sit on it and let my future allocations act to rebalance and dilute the impact it will have on me? Edit: I got my tax loss harvesting wrong, my gains from VUG are about $1000 so the -$144 from the stock does very little.",

I was investing 503020 in VOOVUGVXUS and that is the current breakdown of my portfolio balance . I would like to now aim for a 7030 split in VOOVXUS as I am worried I am too leveraged into US large cap growth especially with a looming tech bubble . My question is should I 1 sell off my VUG position and rebalance into VOOVXUS since I have held the assets for more than a year and should be in the 15 % capital gains bracket based on my standard income 2 sell off VUG and put it into VTI instead of VOO to better hedge against the tech bubble pop and keep investing in VTI going forward 3 not_touch VUG at all and just continue to invest in VOOVXUS or VTIVXUS moving forward Best I can figure is about $ 150 in taxes from capital gains which I think I can offset by tax loss harvesting a solo stock I bought years ago as a crap shoot that ’ s down $ 144 . Is that all not_worth it and should I just sit on it and let my future allocations act to rebalance and dilute the impact it will have on me Edit I got my tax loss harvesting wrong my gains from VUG are about $ 1000 so the $ 144 from the stock does very little ."

The Asian nation’s stock market climbed to a valuation of $3.25 trillion, after adding roughly $1.7 trillion since the start of 2025, according to Bloomberg-compiled data as of Wednesday. That surpassed Germany’s $3.22 trillion, making Korea the world’s 10th‑largest stock market, just behind Taiwan. The reshuffling in rankings highlights the swift rise of Korean stocks, driven by shareholder‑friendly reforms and the nation’s pivotal role in the global AI supply chain. The equity benchmark Kospi has jumped 23% in 2026, while Germany’s Dax Index has climbed just 1.7%, weighed down by geopolitical uncertainties and a lack of clarity over stimulus deployment.",

      "title": "Are we Close to Another Top?",
      "selftext": "Back in early October, I made a post claiming that QQQ with top out at about $637, most people said I was crazy, then ironically, that was the exact spot it corrected weeks later. Here we are three months later, and we are just about at that level again. So now what? With the recent batch of earnings, it does appear the market is building strength, but there are a few signs that underlying market weakness is continuing to build. Maybe we top out here, or maybe resistance breaks, only to produce a throw over, which is common on the fifth wave of an Elliott structure. Other issues I’m seeing… # Liquidity Liquidity is the first and most important piece of the puzzle. Liquidity is essentially the fuel that drives financial markets. A perfect example of this was during Covid when the government stimulus helped power a major rally. On the other hand, when the liquidity dries up, markets often struggle even if fundamentals are strong. Many traders don’t look at liquidity at all, others only focus on if the Fed is engaging in quantitative easing or quantitative tightening, but that’s only part of the story. Another important tool is the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement facility, commonly referred to as RRP. This program allows large financial institutions, especially money market funds, to park cash at the Fed overnight in exchange for Treasury securities. Last year, markets held up better than expected during the quantitative tightening phase because money was flowing out of the RRP and back into the financial system. Essentially, RRP acted as a cushion against the quantitative tightening process. Take a look at RRP now… [ That cushion is now essentially gone. Balances in the RRP facility have fallen from roughly $2.5 trillion in 2023 to only about a billion today. That is essentially nothing. When the tank is empty, it becomes concerning. The large pool of idle cash that could flow back into the system is now gone, and so is the excess fuel that can power the market forward; this is generally negative for stocks. # Put/Call Ratio One of my favorite sentiment indicators and one of the indicators that is often overlooked is the put/call ratio. This indicator compares the volume of put options traded to that of a call option. When the ratio hits .75 the suggests that fear is dominating as traders seek increased protection. Being that this is a contrary an indicator, this often marks market bottoms. Low readings, generally below 0.55, signal complacency and excessive optimism, which tend to show up near market tops. Right now, the equity put call ratio is at .54, so yeah, it’s at a level where we need to be concerned that a market top could be forming and a pullback is on the horizon. # XLY vs. XLP Something else I am monitoring is the relationship between the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) vs. Consumer Staples (XLP). XLP represents companies that sell essential goods such as food, beverages, and household products. Things everybody needs and will continue to buy in any market environment. XLY represents more discretionary spending, including companies like Amazon, Tesla, and Home Depot. These are purchases people make when they feel confident in their finances. When XLY outperforms XLP, it signals a risk on environment. Consumers are spending freely, and that is typically bullish for the economy and the market. When XLP starts to outperform XLY, it suggests consumers are becoming more cautious and shifting spending toward necessities. That defensive rotation can be an early warning sign, even if the broader market is still climbing. See Chart... [ We are now seeing signs that Staples are beginning to outperform Discretionary. That shift does not mean a selloff is about to happen. Markets can continue rising for weeks even as these internal warning signals build. However, it does tell us that defensive positioning may be quietly increasing under the surface. As of late January 2026, XLP has shown noticeably stronger performance year to date compared with XLY. When you combine that with a put/call ratio hovering near complacent levels, it suggests the market may be on a short leash where the risks are rising. Most people probably don’t even know what I’m talking about when I say the Gann window from February 9-11 is quickly approaching, but this is generally an inflection point where markets turn around. You should digest this information however you wish. There’s no reason to jump to conclusions one way or the other, but as traders we should consider that conditions are shifting and that being a little more defensive heading into February, which is generally the second worst trading month of the year and one of only two months that has negative returns over the last 80 years, is simply good financial positioning.",

      "selftext_processed": "Back in early October I made a post claiming that QQQ with top out at about $ 637 most people said I was crazy then ironically that was the exact spot it corrected weeks later . Here we are three months later and we are just about at that level again . So now what With the recent batch of earnings it does appear the market is building strength but there are a few signs that underlying market weakness is continuing to build . Maybe we top out here or maybe resistance breaks only to produce a throw over which is common on the fifth wave of an Elliott structure . Other issues I ’ m seeing… Liquidity Liquidity is the first and most important piece of the puzzle . Liquidity is essentially the fuel that drives financial markets . A perfect example of this was during Covid when the government stimulus helped power a major rally . On the other hand when the liquidity dries up markets often struggle even if fundamentals are strong . Many traders don ’ t look at liquidity at all others only focus on if the Fed is engaging in quantitative easing or quantitative tightening but that ’ s only part of the story . Another important tool is the Federal Reserve ’ s Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement facility commonly referred to as RRP . This program allows large financial institutions especially money market funds to park cash at the Fed overnight in exchange for Treasury securities . Last year markets held up better than expected during the quantitative tightening phase because money was flowing out of the RRP and back into the financial system . Essentially RRP acted as a cushion against the quantitative tightening process . Take a look at RRP now… That cushion is now essentially gone . Balances in the RRP facility have fallen from roughly $ 2.5 trillion in 2023 to only about a billion today . That is essentially nothing_When the tank is empty it becomes concerning . The large pool of idle cash that could flow back into the system is now gone and so is the excess fuel that can power the market forward this is generally negative for stocks . PutCall Ratio One of my favorite sentiment indicators and one of the indicators that is often overlooked is the putcall ratio . This indicator compares the volume of put options traded to that of a call option . When the ratio hits .75 the suggests that fear is dominating as traders seek increased protection . Being that this is a contrary an indicator this often marks market bottoms . Low readings generally below 0.55 signal complacency and excessive optimism which tend to show up near market tops . Right now the equity put call ratio is at .54 so yeah it ’ s at a level where we need to be concerned that a market top could be forming and a pullback is on the horizon . XLY vs. XLP Something else I am monitoring is the relationship between the Consumer Discretionary XLY vs. Consumer Staples XLP . XLP represents companies that sell essential goods such as food beverages and household products . Things everybody needs and will continue to buy in any market environment . XLY represents more discretionary spending including companies like Amazon Tesla and Home Depot . These are purchases people make when they feel confident in their finances . When XLY outperforms XLP it signals a risk on environment . Consumers are spending freely and that is typically bullish for the economy and the market . When XLP starts to outperform XLY it suggests consumers are becoming more cautious and shifting spending toward necessities . That defensive rotation can be an early warning sign even if the broader market is still climbing . See Chart ... We are now seeing signs that Staples are beginning to outperform Discretionary . That shift does not_mean a selloff is about to happen . Markets can continue rising for weeks even as these internal warning signals build . However it does tell us that defensive positioning may be quietly increasing under the surface . As of late January 2026 XLP has shown noticeably stronger performance year to date compared with XLY . When you combine that with a putcall ratio hovering near complacent levels it suggests the market may be on a short leash where the risks are rising . Most people probably don ’ t even know what I ’ m talking about when I say the Gann window from February 911 is quickly approaching but this is generally an inflection point where markets turn around . You should digest this information however you wish . There ’ s no_reason to jump to conclusions one way or the other but as traders we should consider that conditions are shifting and that being a little more defensive heading into February which is generally the second worst trading month of the year and one of only two months that has negative returns over the last 80 years is simply good financial positioning ."

      "selftext": "I think everyone forgot how much the USD crashed from 2006 to 2011. Why? Fed Rate Cuts: The unfolding credit crisis in the U.S. weakened the dollar. As the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates in September 2007 to manage the crisis, the dollar lost its yield advantage, making the euro more attractive to investors. Interest Rate Differentials: While the Fed was cutting rates, the European Central Bank (ECB) was, at times, raising or maintaining higher rates, driving up the value of the euro. Weak U.S. Economic Data: Slowing U.S. economic growth, particularly in the first quarter of 2007, reinforced fears of a widening economic disparity between Europe and the United States. Diversification Away from the Dollar: Central banks and investors were increasingly looking for alternatives to the dollar, with the euro serving as the major alternative, boosting its demand. Eurozone Economic Growth: Robust economic recovery in Germany and overall growth in the eurozone strengthened the currency, with the region's financial markets showing increased vibrancy. Keep adding my friends. Most importantly, keep your jobs if a massive crash happens, but if you’re smart you’ll profit handsomely from this in 5-10 years.",

Many investors start the year with clear intentions, but after a few weeks in, market noise and real-life constraints tend to test those plans. Curious how this is playing out for others: * Are you still aligned with the goals you set at the start of the year? * Have you already adjusted your strategy based on new information or constraints? * Or did you realize some goals weren’t realistic and reset entirely? From an investing perspective, where is your current focus leaning? * increasing consistency / discipline * reducing risk or exposure * building cash or dry powder * simplifying portfolio structure * reassessing overall strategy There’s no single “correct” path, but early reflection often prevents bigger mistakes later in the year.

      "selftext": "Following a lot of the madness lately can be infuriating: civil unrest, Mr Miyagi's Tariffs on Tariffs off, Greenland invasion..or not. *\\*And in part as outrageous as they are, there's a good reason they dominate the headlines to allow the structural financial re-engineering required to proceed without the mass public truly noticing.\\** I’ve taken a position in FXY because I’m betting on a fundamental regime change where the interests of Washington and Tokyo are finding their shared sweet spot. My thesis is built on a rare alignment: US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants a weaker dollar to juice American reshoring as questionable as this methodology may be, while PM Sanae Takaichi desperately needs a stronger Yen to kill the import inflation that’s becoming a political liability and domestic cost of living crisis issue. I’ve intentionally sidestepped the Bond dump risks inherent in Japanese Government Bond (JGB) funds, choosing FXY as the cleanest, most surgical tool to capture the Yen’s recovery. The alternative is straight Forex trading of course. The market is slowly validating the move, with this week’s Rate Checks acting as a warning light for a coordinated central bank push. In light of this, I feel we may be seeing a Fed End-Run where, rather than letting Japan dump Treasuries and spike US yields, the Fed is printing USD to buy Yen on Japan's behalf. This weakens the Dollar and strengthens the Yen without breaking the bond market and tanking the reputation of Treasurys. The recent velocity of the USD/JPY, which has already move from 159 down toward 152 in a matter of days, is the first indicator that the massive carry trade is beginning to unwind. The cryptocurrency pullback recently experienced is typical of high-risk positions being first to get trimmed when liquidity tightens, as capital is pulled out of highest-to-lowest risk stocks, and best runner profit margins are secured. In terms of targets, my target for FXY is a realistic $69-72 per share. After factoring in the fund’s internal decay (representing roughly 9,180 Yen per share), this price reflects a goldilocks exchange rate of roughly 132-130 USD/JPY. This is an asymmetrical bet on a structural global shift. If a sharp dump of the stock market actually hits in 2026, FXY and the Yen become a runner. Personally, I would stay away from leveraged ETPs due to increased decay over medium and longer terms, over anything past a multi-day trade. I'm still in several undervalued stocks, and plan to hold through a downturn, but have trimmed some high runners such as UAMY, and increased FXY as my hedge going into a turbulent 2026.

This seems like some sort of global systemic failure. * The dollar dropped a significant 1% the other day to its weakest level in four years [ * Japanese bonds have been dropping on major sell offs, signally a crisis in the yen [ * Both Japan and USA are tied at the hip financially, and both experiencing sovereign debt issues with massive debt to GDP ratios. Neither wants to pay higher interest rates on such massive debt. * Strengthening the yen means selling off US treasuries at a time the US can least afford it * The popular \"yen carry\" trade relies on a consistent relationship between yen-dollar value and respective interest rates on debt, which could be in jeopardy in a currency crisis [ * Gold spiked 4% today during Asian trading hours. That's a big move for gold and could be a warning sign * Add to that Trump chaos and a push for easy money fed policies post Jerome Powell, that's further pressure on the US dollar and bond market Overall it looks like a day of reckoning is coming. Not sure exactly what or when, but it's looking nasty. Any predictions?",

The dollar dropped a significant 1 % the other day to its weakest level in four years Japanese bonds have been dropping on major sell offs signally a crisis in the yen Both Japan and USA are tied at the hip financially and both experiencing sovereign debt issues with massive debt to GDP ratios . Neither_wants to pay higher interest rates on such massive debt . Strengthening the yen means selling off US treasuries at a time the US can least afford it The popular yen carry trade relies on a consistent relationship between yendollar value and respective interest rates on debt which could be in jeopardy in a currency crisis Gold spiked 4 % today during Asian trading hours . Thats a big move for gold and could be a warning sign Add to that Trump chaos and a push for easy money fed policies post Jerome Powell thats further pressure on the US dollar and bond market Overall it looks like a day of reckoning is coming . Not_sure exactly what or when but its looking nasty . Any predictions"

Metals have entered parabolic hype cycles in 1979, 2011, and 2025-26 without “fundamentals” numbers to constrain their price appreciation.

With this platform, WeRide can operate virtual cities in the most realistic way or dangerous driving situations that are hard to appear on real roads. This brings to a result of faster development and lower testing costs, better performance in real life after training in simulation. The platform is aiming to solve major problems in auto space: different cities different roads, different situations and traffic behaviors. GENESIS lets AVs handle in virtual cities across high risk cases, improving safety before deployment. The platforms supports from advanced driver systems to Level 4 robotaxis. At CES 2026, Jensen Huang highlighted how AI is moving from screens into real world. From NVIDIA foundation model to Tesla neural network simulator for FSD, GENESIS is part of this ecosystem, supporting the autonomous industry scale faster, validate safe and move closer to real deployment.",

      "selftext": "I have spent the past couple of months debunking posts on bubbles. I said that all the data showed the exact opposite, a healthy bull market. I also said I would write if I saw something different in the data. There are a few developments which should garner our attention. None of them are loud. None of these them headline driven. But together, they raise a question about the underlying health of the market. \\*Strength in Consumer Staples\\*- In a healthy bull market there’s practically no demand for consumer staple stocks. These are the products people buy regardless. Toilet paper, toothpaste, laundry detergents, cigarettes. The basics. Last year, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) returned just 1.5%, compared to a 17.7% gain for the S&P 500. So far, in 2026, the script has flipped. Consumer staples are already up 6.5% year to date, while the S&P 500 is up just 1.5%. Compared to financials it looks worse. We don’t have bull markets without financials. When I see financials sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard as the worst performing sector to date, that gets my attention. That concern takes root at the same time consumer staples are showing strength. That combination is not what you see in a healthy bull market. It is certainly not sustainable. When we look at financials relative to consumer staples it becomes clearer. The ratio just hit new five year lows. The ratio has now fallen back below the prior highs of February and July of 2025, it has also lost a key pivot low from October. Former support is falling. That’s not great news if you are long the market. It’s not debatable. It’s not subtle. And it doesn’t look very good. If you are bullish you need to see this line snap back quickly. Not eventually. Not after a few more headlines. Quickly. When we see multiple warning signs stack up on each other, the burden of proof shifts. If these relationships don’t recover soon the market won’t need headlines to do the damage. The market will do damage on its own. Now you know what I do.",

But together they raise a question about the underlying health of the market . Strength in Consumer Staples In a healthy bull market there ’ s practically no_demand for consumer staple stocks . These are the products people buy regardless . Toilet paper toothpaste laundry detergents cigarettes . The basics . Last year the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF XLP returned just 1.5 % compared to a 17.7 % gain for the SP 500 . So far in 2026 the script has flipped . Consumer staples are already up 6.5 % year to date while the SP 500 is up just 1.5 % . Compared to financials it looks worse . We don ’ t have bull markets without financials . When I see financials sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard as the worst performing sector to date that gets my attention . That concern takes root at the same time consumer staples are showing strength . That combination is not_what you see in a healthy bull market . It is certainly not_sustainable . When we look at financials relative to consumer staples it becomes clearer . The ratio just hit new five year lows . The ratio has now fallen back below the prior highs of February and July of 2025 it has also lost a key pivot low from October . Former support is falling . That ’ s not_great news if you are long the market . It ’ s not_debatable . It ’ s not_subtle . And it doesn ’ t look very good . If you are bullish you need to see this line snap back quickly . Not_eventually . Not_after a few more headlines . Quickly . When we see multiple warning signs stack up on each other the burden of proof shifts . If these relationships don ’ t recover soon the market won ’ t need headlines to do the damage . The market will do damage on its own . Now you know what I do ."

      "title": "The Block (SQ) stock risk assessment :",
      "selftext": "I’ve been working on a tool to automate risk analysis specifically to catch red flags that often get buried in 10-Ks and other news. I usually run it on companies I’m eyeing to see if I missed any structural risks. I recently ran it on Block (SQ) given the recent volatility and the \"AI pivot and Crypto\" narrative. While the stock has momentum, the tool surfaced some deep fundamental disconnects that go beyond the usual headlines. I wanted to share the 4 biggest risks it flagged to see if you guys think these are valid concerns or if the market is rightfully ignoring them. 1. The \"Value Destruction\" Gap (ROIC vs. WACC) This was the loudest signal. This was flagged a massive spread between return and cost: ROIC (Return on Invested Capital): \\\\\\~0.76% WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): \\\\\\~8.21% Despite reporting accounting profits, the business is technically destroying shareholder value on every dollar invested right now. Operational returns aren't covering the cost of capital. Usually, you see this in dying industries, not \"growth\" fintechs. Is this just temporary due to the restructuring, or is the core payments business losing efficiency? 2. Cash Flow Quality: Organic or Accounting Magic? Headline Operating Cash Flow looks incredible: jumping from 101M to 1.7B (2024). The Red Flag: The tool flagged that this wasn't driven purely by higher sales. It was driven by a sharp contraction in working capital. Receivables dropped from $7.19B → $5.67B. Payables fell from $141M → $118M. Retained Earnings swung wildly from -528M to +2.3B. This suggests the cash flow boom is largely \"one-off\" balance sheet timing (squeezing customers/suppliers) rather than a permanent improvement in earnings power. 3. The $11.4 Billion Goodwill Overhang Goodwill: $11.4B Intangibles: $1.4B Total: \\\\\\~35% of Total Assets. With the company pivoting focus toward Bitcoin and AI, and away from legacy integrations, the tool flagged a high risk of impairment. If the acquisitions that make up that $11B (like Afterpay) underperform, we could see a massive writedown that wipes out reported equity. 4. Borrowing to Buy Back Stock The financing activities section shows a contradiction. Long-term debt jumped from $4.97B to $6.4B. Simultaneously, they spent \\\\\\~$1.17B on equity repayments/buybacks. Leveraging up the balance sheet to buy back stock while ROIC is 0.76% seems like questionable capital allocation. Conclusion: The tool paints a picture of a company that is optically improving cash flow through working capital adjustments while the underlying capital efficiency (ROIC) is surprisingly weak. For those tracking SQ: Do you view the ROIC/WACC spread as a dealbreaker, or is it a lagging indicator that will catch up as the layoffs/restructuring fully take effect?",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been working on a tool to automate risk analysis specifically to catch red flags that often get buried in 10Ks and other news . I usually run it on companies I ’ m eyeing to see if I missed any structural risks . I recently ran it on Block SQ given the recent volatility and the AI pivot and Crypto narrative . While the stock has momentum the tool surfaced some deep fundamental disconnects that go beyond the usual headlines . I wanted to share the 4 biggest risks it flagged to see if you guys think these are valid concerns or if the market is rightfully ignoring them . 1 . The Value Destruction Gap ROIC vs. WACC This was the loudest signal . This was flagged a massive spread between return and cost ROIC Return on Invested Capital 0.76 % WACC Weighted Average Cost of Capital 8.21 % Despite reporting accounting profits the business is technically destroying shareholder value on every dollar invested right now . Operational returns arent covering the cost of capital . Usually you see this in dying industries not_growth fintechs . Is this just temporary due to the restructuring or is the core payments business losing efficiency 2 . Cash Flow Quality Organic or Accounting Magic Headline Operating Cash Flow looks incredible jumping from 101M to 1.7B 2024 . The Red Flag The tool flagged that this wasnt driven purely by higher sales . It was driven by a sharp contraction in working capital . Receivables dropped from $ 7.19B → $ 5.67B . Payables fell from $ 141M → $ 118M . Retained Earnings swung wildly from 528M to 2.3B . This suggests the cash flow boom is largely oneoff balance sheet timing squeezing customerssuppliers rather than a permanent improvement in earnings power . 3 . The $ 11.4 Billion Goodwill Overhang Goodwill $ 11.4B Intangibles $ 1.4B Total 35 % of Total Assets . With the company pivoting focus toward Bitcoin and AI and away from legacy integrations the tool flagged a high risk of impairment . If the acquisitions that make up that $ 11B like Afterpay underperform we could see a massive writedown that wipes out reported equity . 4 . Borrowing to Buy Back Stock The financing activities section shows a contradiction . Longterm debt jumped from $ 4.97B to $ 6.4B . Simultaneously they spent $ 1.17B on equity repaymentsbuybacks . Leveraging up the balance sheet to buy back stock while ROIC is 0.76 % seems like questionable capital allocation . Conclusion The tool paints a picture of a company that is optically improving cash flow through working capital adjustments while the underlying capital efficiency ROIC is surprisingly weak . For those tracking SQ Do you view the ROICWACC spread as a dealbreaker or is it a lagging indicator that will catch up as the layoffsrestructuring fully take effect"

META, MSFT, AAPL, next week AMZN, AMD and more all reporting Q4 2025 earnings. I think despite all the political and trade turmoil, big tech is doing better than just fine, they are still booming. META is expected to post an increasing profit in Q4 of $21B from $20.8B, YoY. CapEx from AI is what is making this increase so small, but I believe that to be priced in at this point when it fell below 600 last year. (although this might raise concerns for some). The standout number to me is the expected revenue of $58.45B from $48.39B, YoY. A staggering 20% increase in revenue YoY is what catches my eye that META is undervalued right now. Estimated Q4 adjusted eps at $9.03. And this time they won't miss due to a one time tax. All the analysts are coming in with price targets around 800 or above for META as well. To me, all this reads as a company ready to reclaim its proper valuation. With some good guidance from Zuck, I am setting a personal price target/option exit at $720. I bought 24 of these METU calls today around $32.30 with an exit plan of $41-$43. Option Contracts: 02/13 METU 32 C",

META MSFT AAPL next week AMZN AMD and more all reporting Q4 2025 earnings . I think despite all the political and trade turmoil big tech is doing better than just fine they are still booming . META is expected to post an increasing profit in Q4 of $ 21B from $ 20.8B YoY . CapEx from AI is what is making this increase so small but I believe that to be priced in at this point when it fell below 600 last year . although this might raise concerns for some . The standout number to me is the expected revenue of $ 58.45B from $ 48.39B YoY . A staggering 20 % increase in revenue YoY is what catches my eye that META is undervalued right now . Estimated Q4 adjusted eps at $ 9.03 . And this time they wont miss due to a one time tax . All the analysts are coming in with price targets around 800 or above for META as well . To me all this reads as a company ready to reclaim its proper valuation . With some good guidance from Zuck I am setting a personal price targetoption exit at $ 720 . I bought 24 of these METU calls today around $ 32.30 with an exit plan of $ 41 $ 43 . Option Contracts 0213 METU 32 C"

Yes they’re currently losing money but I think the market is missing the ramp up in revenue growth this year as they march towards profitability. They already have trucks on the ground in Texas running loads with plans to have more this year running loads into Phoenix among other places. Their tech is way ahead of anyone else’s.

      "title": "Why the current state of the US Dollar is making me uncomfortable",
      "selftext": "I have growing concerns regarding the current state of the US Dollar and its potential to trigger a global recession. The current administration has openly prioritized a weak dollar policy, evidenced by a 15% depreciation against the Euro since the term began. This is compounded by political pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to 1% and rising geopolitical friction with the EU, which risks a selloff of US Treasuries. My thesis suggests two likely, yet negative, outcomes: **The Path of Non-Intervention** If the dollar continues to devalue unchecked, we risk a surge in commodity prices (already underway), leading to cost-push inflation. While oil supply may mitigate some shocks, a severe spike could threaten the solvency of import-dependent nations. Furthermore, this dynamic encourages \"currency wars,\" where trading partners devalue their own currencies to remain competitive. This erosion of trust could destroy international trade, ultimately leading to stagflation and recession. **The Path of Delayed Intervention** If the US government eventually intervenes, it will likely be a reactive measure taken too late. This would force the Federal Reserve to enact drastic measures, similar to the \"Volcker Shock\" hiking rates aggressively to curb inflation. Alternatively, they might attempt to absorb massive amounts of liquidity. Both approaches would freeze capital expenditure and tighten the economy so severely that a crisis becomes inevitable. I'm struggling to see how the current narrative of the administration is avoiding to change their path for the Dollar, I understand how a small devaluation makes you more competitive when it comes to international trade, I feel we have reached the point where the constant weakening of the Dollar against all other currencies stops favoring the US and just starts destroying the global economy. I am seeking feedback on this assessment: Is this thesis economically sound, or am I overestimating the risks? I basically want to hear the rest of the people so I can atleast start seeing other points of views on how the US's narrative might make sense.",

      "selftext": "I have traded mostly stocks, ETFs and Options last year (around 200 executed orders in 2025) with a reasonable level of success (in a bull market anyone is a hero). Reviewing the trades it became clear I let my losers run too long and cut some winners short too early. I have set myself a goal of being more disciplined in trading this year and came up with the following strategy: # Overview: * Goal: 20%/year target return * Time horizon: 5 years * Max Drawdown: 25% # Additional constrains: * No single trade above 1% of portfolio total * Per-Ticker Limits: 10% single stock/20% single ETF * Asset type concentration limits: Stocks: 35%/ETFs: 45%/Options: 20% # Sector Allocations (soft limits): * Information Technology: 35% * Energy: 5% * Large Blend: 30% (mostly for indexed ETFs - VOO, etc...) * Other sectors: 30% # How I plan on implement the rules: 1. All assets held must have a stop-loss/trailing stop-loss set at 15%-20% of either current price or entry price (use TA to identify support levels near the trigger value) 2. Option count against underlying ticker concentration - *100 Shares of NVDA + 1 short Put NVDA Contract = 200 share commitment.* 3. If total stock allocation is met, use LEAPS as stock replacement up to the 20% limit As I'm investing across a range of account types (401K Traditional and Brokerage, Roth IRA, Taxable Brokerage, HSA), there are differences in types of operations I can make in each one of them. It gets a bit complicated but I try to use LEAPS across Roth IRA and Taxable Brokerage, while I can Wheel assets on the 401K Brokerage. I need to stick with the selection of mutual funds in 401K traditional. I don't understand Options enough to operate multi-leg strategies so I don't play with them. # Current portfolio: Current stocks held in descending order of value: NVDA, PLTR, NOW, SMCI, CALM, GOOG, IREN, ADBE, OKTA, FISV, SPT Current ETFs held in descending order of value: IWB, VOO, MGK, SMH Current open option contracts: Long LEAPS on the following underlying: NVO, NVDA, PLTR, NOK, KLAR, KVUE/A few Covered Calls on SMH, NOW, IREN, OKTA # Feedback Request Before I implement the strategy and limits, I would like to get feedback on the overall framework. Specific questions: \\- Should I tighten up the stop-loss limit on Stocks/ETFs and use the slack to broaden up the stop-loss limits for LEAPS/Options - keeping the 25% drawdown total? \\- Should I consider stashing 5% os total invested in corporate bonds (ETF along the lines of IGIB) as dry powder to buy significant dips? \\- Any glaring holes or immediate improvements to be made? \\- Anyone operates under a similar framework and can share experience? Thanks!",

Reviewing the trades it became clear I let my losers run too long and cut some winners short too early .

Other sectors 30 % How I plan on implement the rules 1 . All assets held must have a stoplosstrailing stoploss set at 15 % 20 % of either current price or entry price use TA to identify support levels near the trigger value 2 . Option count against underlying ticker concentration 100 Shares of NVDA 1 short Put NVDA Contract 200 share commitment . 3 . If total stock allocation is met use LEAPS as stock replacement up to the 20 % limit As Im investing across a range of account types 401K Traditional and Brokerage Roth IRA Taxable Brokerage HSA there are differences in types of operations I can make in each one of them . It gets a bit complicated but I try to use LEAPS across Roth IRA and Taxable Brokerage while I can Wheel assets on the 401K Brokerage . I need to stick with the selection of mutual funds in 401K traditional . I dont understand Options enough to operate multileg strategies so I dont play with them .

Her: \"Why dad?\" Me: \"Well, It supposedly dropped due to the kids using it less\" Her: \"But dad every single person i know plays Roblox and everyone is addicted to it. <Insert friends name here> even SPENDS REAL MONEY on it!!\" Me: \"I know that, so can not really explain it, but let us just hope your friends start to spend more money on it haha. Lets just wait and see, remember you lost nothing until you decide to sell it\" Her: \"Weird\" (Then of course proceeds to play Roblox for hours with at least 3 of her other friends) Anyway, pretty certain i failed on that lesson, but at least planted a seed, oh and her VOO is up 13%, so a lesson was hopefully learned there as well.",

Her Why dad Me Well It supposedly dropped due to the kids using it less Her But dad every single person i know plays Roblox and everyone is addicted to it . Insert friends name here even SPENDS REAL MONEY on it Me I know that so can not_really explain it but let us just hope your friends start to spend more money on it haha . Lets just wait and see remember you lost nothing_until you decide to sell it Her Weird Then of course proceeds to play Roblox for hours with at least 3 of her other friends Anyway pretty certain i failed on that lesson but at least planted a seed oh and her VOO is up 13 % so a lesson was hopefully learned there as well ."

      "selftext": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) - a stock that has burned Retail Traders and Wall Street analysts, has confirmed Q2 earnings for 2/3/26 after market close. They are forecasted to announce revenue $10-11 B and EPS $.45-$.54. At a $18B market cap, this is very attractive valuation for an AI stock, even an AI stock on the wrong end of the chip business. However, Wall Street does not believe a word they are saying. After 2 years of earnings misses and declining margins, SMCI is poised to explode either up or down. My completely uneducated and NOT FINANCIAL advice suggests SMCI stock is going to either $15 or $50 in the next two weeks. Acting on this hypothesis, I have opened a 2-13-26 dated $30 straddle position. Please balance your risk and reward and diversify your stock portfolio.",

However Wall Street does not_believe a word they are saying . After 2 years of earnings misses and declining margins SMCI is poised to explode either up or down . My completely uneducated and NOT_FINANCIAL advice suggests SMCI stock is going to either $ 15 or $ 50 in the next two weeks . Acting on this hypothesis I have opened a 21326 dated $ 30 straddle position . Please balance your risk and reward and diversify your stock portfolio ."

I remember when semiconductor stocks were being talked about everywhere in 2016 (when they were unknown and lowkey) all the nerds were posting legit analysis about DRAM prices, implementation in various hardware products, how it would track with the crypto boom due to CPUs/GPUs, etc. seriously, how is Reddit goin to make money? the ads are irrelevant and from no name companies. I see the same posts reposted 5x a week to karma farm “whats the biggest regret of your life” lmfao i love Reddit (the subreddit niches helped me alot in my career and early life) and normally buy what use, but the concerns are genuine. AI and bot posts are way more common, constantly reposts of the same shit, and this place in general is a liberal echo box which will deter the masses downvote all you want but this is a public company now, to capture the young demographic entirely I’m sure they don’t want to log-in everyday and see a post on [r/all](/r/all/) about ONLY vaccines and left wing propoganda. Why the fuck is the number one post some corny picture of a soilder Punching a nazi? it should be something trendy and relevant like that idiot clavicular EDIT: do you guys SEE what i MEAN? isnt the controversy and polarizing opinion of MINE getting the JUICES FLOWING and real human emotion involved thus higher comments and replies in this post? there should be 100,000 of me, i cant do this alone. this is what reddit should turn into, not an echobox full of censoring, not AI slop, not 10 posts a day about why i should get vaccinated. i want to log into [r/all]( one day and see dslr pics of a trump rally and another being a post about how those who didnt get the covid vaccine will die in 5 years. im tired of logging in everyday and seeing the same post \"people in their 30s, what do you regret in your 20s\" or ONLY \"Study: why letting my 12 year old son chop his weiner off and change genders will reduce his depression rate\" [u/spez]( hire me i know how to get the job done, let me take this bad boy to $1k a share",

I remember when semiconductor stocks were being talked about everywhere in 2016 when they were unknown and lowkey all the nerds were posting legit analysis about DRAM prices implementation in various hardware products how it would track with the crypto boom due to CPUsGPUs etc . seriously how is Reddit goin to make money the ads are irrelevant and from no_name companies . I see the same posts reposted 5x a week to karma farm “ whats the biggest regret of your life ” lmfao i love Reddit the subreddit niches helped me alot in my career and early life and normally buy what use but the concerns are genuine . AI and bot posts are way more common constantly reposts of the same shit and this place in general is a liberal echo box which will deter the masses downvote all you want but this is a public company now to capture the young demographic entirely I ’ m sure they don ’ t want to login everyday and see a post on rallrall about ONLY vaccines and left wing propoganda . Why the fuck is the number one post some corny picture of a soilder Punching a nazi it should be something trendy and relevant like that idiot clavicular EDIT do you guys SEE what i MEAN isnt the controversy and polarizing opinion of MINE getting the JUICES FLOWING and real human emotion involved thus higher comments and replies in this post there should be 100000 of me i cant do this alone . this is what reddit should turn into not_an echobox full of censoring not_AI slop not_10 posts a day about why i should get vaccinated . i want to log into rall one day and see dslr pics of a trump rally and another being a post about how those who didnt get the covid vaccine will die in 5 years . im tired of logging in everyday and seeing the same post people in their 30s what do you regret in your 20s or ONLY Study why letting my 12 year old son chop his weiner off and change genders will reduce his depression rate uspez hire me i know how to get the job done let me take this bad boy to $ 1k a share"

      "title": "Does flexibility meaningfully improve long-term portfolio outcomes, or is full investment still optimal?",
      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over extended periods, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing, drawdown deployment, or reduced forced selling during stress periods. While this approach may lower expected returns, it could potentially improve risk-adjusted outcomes and reduce forced selling during market stress, depending on how it is implemented. From a structural perspective, this raises a broader question: should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management, or simply an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? For those focused on long horizons, how do you think about this tradeoff in practice? Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework, or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested?",

      "selftext_processed": "In longterm portfolio construction being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments . Over extended periods idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark . At the same time some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing drawdown deployment or reduced forced selling during stress periods . While this approach may lower expected returns it could potentially improve riskadjusted outcomes and reduce forced selling during market stress depending on how it is implemented . From a structural perspective this raises a broader question should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management or simply an inefficiency that longterm investors should minimize For those focused on long horizons how do you think about this tradeoff in practice Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested"

The main goal is: Capital should stay safe No stock market or risky investments Monthly income of around ₹80k–₹1 lakh to manage regular expenses Minimal monitoring and no stress Basically looking for something stable where the money stays intact and generates a predictable monthly income. Just wanted to understand from people here: Is this kind of monthly income realistic without taking risk? If yes, what kind of options should we look at? If not, what would be a sensible expectation from a completely safe setup? Would really appreciate advice from anyone who has dealt with retirement planning or similar situations. Thanks.",

      "selftext": "While any specific thoughts on the individual stock (CENX/Century Aluminum) are welcome, I'm also/more broadly interested in how folks handle your unexpected wins that wildly exceed your expectations especially in the realm of small caps where you readily realize you just got lucky. FWIW, my brokerage account I used for individual stock picks is a pretty tiny portion of my overall portfolio -- I am no pro, nor any kind of day trader and mostly, I stick with large/mega caps. Still, I always told myself \"If you can't keep pace with the S&P, you've just got an expensive hobby\". Over 6 years now - I've held my own or better, thanks largely to getting in early on NVDA and standard stalwarts like AMZN and AAPL. Anyway, I don't usually bother with small caps - but \\~3 years ago, I read an interesting article in Kiplinger about potential under the radar beneficiaries of the 2021/2022 infrastructure/manufacturing bills. CENX was one of the names mentioned. I read more - they had some aggressive expansion plans, including some new tech/methods. I did - as I always try to do - pored over the 10-K/10-Qs and thought the finances looked solid. Bought in further in 2024 - quite clear no matter who won the election, such public investment wasn't going away. I wouldn't ask this sort of question about large caps, but small caps... oy. Not a charts guy, but short% creeping towards 20%. CENX missed earnings throughout 2025, but still had an unbelievable year price-wise. Sector averages on P/E, now even growth? Don't look good. And worst of all? \"Materials\" is just not a sector I'm familiar with. My *gut* \\- every ounce of it - says take the money and run... I'm now, total cash basis - up nearly 500%, long on all positions. What was really a pretty small total investment has suddenly become real money. However, my gut isn't always very smart. And I'm really just a \"buy-and-hold\" guy. AND - as the title says, I believe in \"cut your weeds, not your flowers\". Like I said, any specific thoughts on it are welcome -- but more broadly, ***especially*** from more seasoned investors. How and when do you decide that even your \"winners\" have exceeded expectations and you start to wonder whether its time to take the profits and reallocate to \"safer\" investments? Or - do you not? Even crashing out - the position here wouldn't hurt me in the grand scheme.",

FWIW my brokerage account I used for individual stock picks is a pretty tiny portion of my overall portfolio I am no_pro nor any kind of day trader and mostly I stick with largemega caps . Still I always told myself If you cant keep pace with the SP youve just got an expensive hobby . Over 6 years now Ive held my own or better thanks largely to getting in early on NVDA and standard stalwarts like AMZN and AAPL . Anyway I dont usually bother with small caps but 3 years ago I read an interesting article in Kiplinger about potential under the radar beneficiaries of the 20212022 infrastructuremanufacturing bills . CENX was one of the names mentioned . I read more they had some aggressive expansion plans including some new techmethods . I did as I always try to do pored over the 10K10Qs and thought the finances looked solid . Bought in further in 2024 quite clear no_matter who won the election such public investment wasnt going away . I wouldnt ask this sort of question about large caps but small caps ... oy . Not_a charts guy but short % creeping towards 20 % . CENX missed earnings throughout 2025 but still had an unbelievable year pricewise . Sector averages on PE now even growth Dont look good . And worst of all Materials is just not_a sector Im familiar with . My gut every ounce of it says take the money and run ... Im now total cash basis up nearly 500 % long on all positions . What was really a pretty small total investment has suddenly become real money . However my gut isnt always very smart . And Im really just a buyandhold guy . AND as the title says I believe in cut your weeds not_your flowers . Like I said any specific thoughts on it are welcome but more broadly especially from more seasoned investors . How and when do you decide that even your winners have exceeded expectations and you start to wonder whether its time to take the profits and reallocate to safer investments Or do you not_Even crashing out the position here wouldnt hurt me in the grand scheme ."

      "selftext": "Back in May of last year when all the tariff stuff was going on I KNEW eventually everything would be going back up. I wanted to buy Nasdaq futures and just hold them forever, I said we will never see these lows again. However Silver futures at the time got trounced from $35 down to $30 in 2 days, a once in a lifetime move at the time so I decided to go all in and put every penny I had into silver futures. Had about $600,000 (I am not even rich, I just had won a lot in sports betting, put it in the market and made even more) and I bought 41 Silver future contracts on a Friday for about $29.75. For that amount of futures it is $210,000 for every dollar silver moved, had it gone back up to just $35 it was 2 days ago I would up $1 million dollars but I was ready to hold it for years, I thought would get to $50 or so and make a killing..... By the time the market opened up on Sunday night the futures got crushed and opened even lower at $28 and dropped all the way to $27.54 a low that will never be seen again. At that point I was down $460,000 and all but wiped out = a few more ticks lower and it would have been a margin call and automatic sale from TD. About to go broke I said a prayer and low and behold the market rallied and not even 3 hours later I actually sold the futures at $30.02 for a $50,000 profit. I had no choice, I couldn't take the chance it dropped again and wipe me out, my dreams of holding for the long term was over. I moved on and in grand tard fashion ended up losing every single penny of that money on other futures and options trades over the next month But the killer is Silver made the move I knew would happen and is now $100+. I knew it was going back up (i thought maybe $50, never though $100), I knew I wanted to hold it forever. If I was able to hold it until now that that would be a profit of over $14 million dollars on the 41 contracts. But even worse my plan was that as I made profits I would just keep buying more futures as it went up. I would have had at least 500 contracts by now easily would have made over $100 Million dollars on this trade. And that puts me as the #1 grand tard of all the grand tards in this sub. I know it would happen, I made the trade, and I still lost all my money Have a good day",

      "selftext_processed": "Back in May of last year when all the tariff stuff was going on I KNEW eventually everything would be going back up . I wanted to buy Nasdaq futures and just hold them forever I said we will never_see these lows again . However Silver futures at the time got trounced from $ 35 down to $ 30 in 2 days a once in a lifetime move at the time so I decided to go all in and put every penny I had into silver futures . Had about $ 600000 I am not_even rich I just had won a lot in sports betting put it in the market and made even more and I bought 41 Silver future contracts on a Friday for about $ 29.75 . For that amount of futures it is $ 210000 for every dollar silver moved had it gone back up to just $ 35 it was 2 days ago I would up $ 1 million dollars but I was ready to hold it for years I thought would get to $ 50 or so and make a killing ..... By the time the market opened up on Sunday night the futures got crushed and opened even lower at $ 28 and dropped all the way to $ 27.54 a low that will never_be seen again . At that point I was down $ 460000 and all but wiped out a few more ticks lower and it would have been a margin call and automatic sale from TD . About to go broke I said a prayer and low and behold the market rallied and not_even 3 hours later I actually sold the futures at $ 30.02 for a $ 50000 profit . I had no_choice I couldnt take the chance it dropped again and wipe me out my dreams of holding for the long term was over . I moved on and in grand tard fashion ended up losing every single penny of that money on other futures and options trades over the next month But the killer is Silver made the move I knew would happen and is now $ 100 . I knew it was going back up i thought maybe $ 50 never_though $ 100 I knew I wanted to hold it forever . If I was able to hold it until now that that would be a profit of over $ 14 million dollars on the 41 contracts . But even worse my plan was that as I made profits I would just keep buying more futures as it went up . I would have had at least 500 contracts by now easily would have made over $ 100 Million dollars on this trade . And that puts me as the 1 grand tard of all the grand tards in this sub . I know it would happen I made the trade and I still lost all my money Have a good day"

      "selftext": "Hey all, So, just a bit about myself & my investing journey: I'm from Hong Kong & was first introduced to investing at 13 after reading bits of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Having an older baby boomer British father who always thought stocks were \"gambling\", I struggled with the scarcity mindset that I was brought up with & had to take the longest time trying to change this mindset. I never started investing till I was about 22 back in 2020 & even then, I was a very conservative investor & only invested about US$130 a month into a unit trust fund from my bank (HSBC) - I blame my lack of financial literacy at the time as I didn't know how to open an investment account & was so hesitant to transfer money out of my bank account. (What a waste of an opportunity.) Later that year, I got thrust into the world of speculation after being asked to recommend stocks by a friend who wanted a very aggressive approach with his investing (At one point, he wanted to go all in on one stock.) As I was risk averse, I never attempted to try picking stocks with my own money & as it turned out, using Reddit as my main source of information as a retail investor, my stock picks were actually winners if I had sold them at the right time at the time - I looked into BYD, NIO, PLTR, MARA, DDD, OCGN, GME. Fast forward 5 years & my financial literacy has improved as I spent hours listening to finance podcasts & reading investing books. I've managed to put in consistently put money into VT each month & the more financial content I consume, the more I realize that I'm more geared towards being a broad index investor rather than a stock picker. I still haven't started picking stocks & I can't help but beat myself up for not taking the risk back then. The hindsight bias has been brutal & taxing to my mental health knowing how life changing the potential return could've been but anyway, would've, could've, should've, I understand Hindsight is 20/20. I still have these lingering questions at the back of my head: * Am I bad at taking risks? * How do I make of this experience when I was an absolute beginner? (Was I too harsh on myself?) * Should I even be trying to pick stocks based on Reddit advice knowing how indecisive I can be making such decisions as we all know markets are forward looking & the stock prices have the possibility of already being priced in? * How do I learn from the experience & most importantly, moving forward, how do I develop the CORRECT mindset for my investing journey & rid myself of the regret from the hindsight bias I've been struggling with for some time now? I would love all your feedback & opinions on this & would love to know if you have any stories related to this that you would be happy to share. (It would definitely help a lot!)",

Having an older baby boomer British father who always thought stocks were gambling I struggled with the scarcity mindset that I was brought up with had to take the longest time trying to change this mindset . I never_started investing till I was about 22 back in 2020 even then I was a very conservative investor only invested about US $ 130 a month into a unit trust fund from my bank HSBC I blame my lack of financial literacy at the time as I didnt know how to open an investment account was so hesitant to transfer money out of my bank account . What a waste of an opportunity . Later that year I got thrust into the world of speculation after being asked to recommend stocks by a friend who wanted a very aggressive approach with his investing At one point he wanted to go all in on one stock . As I was risk averse I never_attempted to try picking stocks with my own money as it turned out using Reddit as my main source of information as a retail investor my stock picks were actually winners if I had sold them at the right time at the time I looked into BYD NIO PLTR MARA DDD OCGN GME . Fast forward 5 years my financial literacy has improved as I spent hours listening to finance podcasts reading investing books . Ive managed to put in consistently put money into VT each month the more financial content I consume the more I realize that Im more geared towards being a broad index investor rather than a stock picker . I still havent started picking stocks I cant help but beat myself up for not_taking the risk back then . The hindsight bias has been brutal taxing to my mental health knowing how life changing the potential return couldve been but anyway wouldve couldve shouldve I understand Hindsight is 2020 . I still have these lingering questions at the back of my head Am I bad at taking risks How do I make of this experience when I was an absolute beginner Was I too harsh on myself Should I even be trying to pick stocks based on Reddit advice knowing how indecisive I can be making such decisions as we all know markets are forward looking the stock prices have the possibility of already being priced in How do I learn from the experience most importantly moving forward how do I develop the CORRECT mindset for my investing journey rid myself of the regret from the hindsight bias Ive been struggling with for some time now I would love all your feedback opinions on this would love to know if you have any stories related to this that you would be happy to share . It would definitely help a lot"

      "selftext": "India's oil minister says US-India talks are \"very advanced,\" eyeing a quick sign-off. But Trump's crew is slamming 50% tariffs on Indian goods (punishing Russian oil buys) and criticizing the new EU-India \"mother of all deals.\" Is this a breakthrough or a trap that spikes China tensions and tanks EM funds? Bearish vibes strong. Even platforms like Bitget with tokenized stocks are mirroring the volatility in Indian equities amid these tariff threats. Key red flags are piling up based on fresh reports: the U.S. has already hammered India with 50% duties on certain goods, while Treasury pick Scott Bessent blasts the EU-India FTA as \"financing war against themselves\" through indirect Russia ties, and Trump's broader threats, like 100% tariffs on Canada and 25% on South Korea, could easily escalate the mess. Meanwhile, the EU-India power move, a landmark deal slashing tariffs on 96.6% of goods and boosting EU exports to India, significantly reduces U.S. leverage according to experts. This geopolitical fallout might heighten U.S.-China friction even further, putting intense pressure on emerging market ETFs like INDA and EEM through potential outflows. If it lands, it could stabilize supply chains and boost bilateral trade (currently \\~$200B), giving U.S. firms better access to India's market amid China decoupling. But experts like former trade officials say the EU deal gives India \"immediate price advantages,\" making U.S. negotiations tougher. what's your take? Is the deal a done thing, or will tariffs kill it?",

But Trumps crew is slamming 50 % tariffs on Indian goods punishing Russian oil buys and criticizing the new EUIndia mother of all deals . Is this a breakthrough or a trap that spikes China tensions and tanks EM funds Bearish vibes strong . Even platforms like Bitget with tokenized stocks are mirroring the volatility in Indian equities amid these tariff threats . Key red flags are piling up based on fresh reports the U.S. has already hammered India with 50 % duties on certain goods while Treasury pick Scott Bessent blasts the EUIndia FTA as financing war against themselves through indirect Russia ties and Trumps broader threats like 100 % tariffs on Canada and 25 % on South Korea could easily escalate the mess . Meanwhile the EUIndia power move a landmark deal slashing tariffs on 96.6 % of goods and boosting EU exports to India significantly reduces U.S. leverage according to experts . This geopolitical fallout might heighten U.S.China friction even further putting intense pressure on emerging market ETFs like INDA and EEM through potential outflows . If it lands it could stabilize supply chains and boost bilateral trade currently $ 200B giving U.S. firms better access to Indias market amid China decoupling . But experts like former trade officials say the EU deal gives India immediate price advantages making U.S. negotiations tougher . whats your take Is the deal a done thing or will tariffs kill it"

It has also pulled back on Medicare Advantage offerings for older adults. >The U.S. on ‍Monday proposed an average rate increase of 0.09% in payments to private insurers next year for the Medicare Advantage plans they manage, far below Wall Street's expectations. >This sent shares of top insurers ​Humana, CVS Health and UnitedHealth down more than 12% before the bell. >CMS typically ‌finalizes Medicare Advantage rates in early April. If the current proposal holds, the rate increase would result in more than $700 million in payments to Medicare Advantage plans in 2027. >UnitedHealth sees annual profit per share of greater than $17.75, compared with analysts' average estimate of $17.74, according to data compiled by LSEG. >The company has struggled with higher costs across government-backed ⁠plans for over two years, driven by increased utilization ​of behavioral health services, specialty drugs and home-health ​services. >For the year, adjusted medical care ratio - the percentage of premiums spent on medical care - was 88.9% compared with 85.5% in 2024. Analysts on ‍average had expected 89.1% ⁠for 2025. >The increase was driven by a reduction in Medicare funding, changes from the Inflation Reduction Act combined with accelerating medical cost trends, the company said. >On ⁠an adjusted basis, UnitedHealth earned a fourth-quarter profit of $2.11 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $2.10, ‌according to data compiled by LSEG.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source UnitedHealth on Tuesday forecast 2026 adjusted profit slightly above analysts estimates in a sign that medical costcontrol measures under CEO Stephen ​Hemsley were beginning to reap results . Hemsley who returned as CEO in May to restore ‌investor and consumer trust in the healthcare behemoth has been working to steer the company out of a ‌difficult period that included the murder of a top executive a surge in medical costs a federal probe and Americans anger at insurance industry practices . The company has been aiming for a return to growth in 2026 but expects a challenging recovery in its Medicaid business for ⁠lowerincome Americans due to a ‌mismatch between payment rates and costs for medical services . It has also pulled back on Medicare Advantage offerings for older adults . The U.S. on ‍Monday proposed an average rate increase of 0.09 % in payments to private insurers next year for the Medicare Advantage plans they manage far below Wall Streets expectations . This sent shares of top insurers ​Humana CVS Health and UnitedHealth down more than 12 % before the bell . CMS typically ‌finalizes Medicare Advantage rates in early April . If the current proposal holds the rate increase would result in more than $ 700 million in payments to Medicare Advantage plans in 2027 . UnitedHealth sees annual profit per share of greater than $ 17.75 compared with analysts average estimate of $ 17.74 according to data compiled by LSEG . The company has struggled with higher costs across governmentbacked ⁠plans for over two years driven by increased utilization ​of behavioral health services specialty drugs and homehealth ​services . For the year adjusted medical care ratio the percentage of premiums spent on medical care was 88.9 % compared with 85.5 % in 2024 . Analysts on ‍average had expected 89.1 % ⁠for 2025 . The increase was driven by a reduction in Medicare funding changes from the Inflation Reduction Act combined with accelerating medical cost trends the company said . On ⁠an adjusted basis UnitedHealth earned a fourthquarter profit of $ 2.11 per share compared with analysts average estimate of $ 2.10 ‌according to data compiled by LSEG ."

I want to buy a new house in the next 3y and I know I'm not going make a fortune from all that money... but hey, look at sandisk. What if I bought 100 shares a year ago? I decided since the beginning that I'm on the market for long term, but at the same time I lost some money for bad decisions (quantum computing, pinterest) and lost important money for my house. This thoughts are killing me. I wanted to surf the wave, make good money and leave. I have a friend who's always green - always making money - essentially surfing this market. No financial background, just surfing. I don't want that risk... but he has been soooo lucky. And I'm not. He doesn't do any company analysis. He doesn't care about earnings... on the other side, In the past 3 months I've been spending too much energy creating python scripts to analyse companies, earnings, ps ratio, dilution, etc...... too much energy. At the same time I know I'm right: focused ln the long term. But the other side is saying: you could also surf this bull marker wave and make money. And you're not. You could put money in Siemens Energy at 75€ (seriously I had the opportunity) but I didn't because I didn't know if I should. Now it's \"just\" 141€. Felling guilty, feeling I'm loosing the wave... because seems a good opportunity, and I know we don't know the future. My friend goes from the \"feeling\", and succeeded. I try to understand things and could make money, and I'm not. Feeling anxious because could making good money, an extra help for my house and I'm not. Feel lost sometimes. I don't want to beat the market, I know I can't . I'm always with yahoo finance open, tracking news and companies, trying to undertsif it's a good time to invest in a company.

      "title": "The silver market is making moves that don’t make sense anymore",
      "selftext": "The swings in silver over the last day have been nothing short of extreme. Within roughly 14 hours, silver saw close to $2 trillion in market cap swing back and forth. Early in the US session it added around $500B, only to give back almost $1T a few hours later, and then rally another $500B again into the evening. That's so insane lol. To put that into perspective: silver was effectively tossing around Bitcoin’s entire market cap multiple times in a single day. This kind of volatility isn’t normal for a market that’s usually viewed as slow, defensive, and macro-driven. It raises some uncomfortable questions about positioning, leverage, and how fragile liquidity really is right now. Curious how others are viewing this. Is this purely speculative flow, forced positioning unwinds, or a sign that stress is building under the surface of broader markets?",

I did no small cap, value, or growth since I thought S&P500 and target dated fund already covers those. I didn’t do international either since the target date fund has that too. Thoughts?",

I didn ’ t do international either since the target date fund has that too . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "I am hoping to get more detailed explanations because I'm no economist, and safe-haven stocks aren't my strong suit, so please correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I saw floating around, that provides a bullish argument for silver is: \\- silver has more industrial use instead of just a primary safe haven stock like gold, so inherently more value \\- there's an active shortage of silver similar to gold \\- if gold goes up, silver follows and people point to different ratios, specifically the 1:15 gold to silver ratio \\- trump's tariffs and geopolitical and domestic instigation seems to be driving volatility \\- fear of recession and increasing inflation in the US because of the tariffs \\- unemployment is rising (but im not sure if this has as much of an adverse effect) \\- yen carry trade showing signs of reversal adding pressure for borrowing money so safe haven's seem better \\- bond yields rising potentially indicating higher inflation is on the horizon \\- dollar devaluation threats exist as well \\- government shutdown probability increased due to the Minnesota shootings as democrats protested to defund ICE Most of this helps gold but silver is seen differently. So I was wondering will silver continue to climb at the rate that it's going? Personally I think that 2026 is going to be a great year for silver and gold if Trump keeps being Trump. Unless democrats control the house and senate after midterms and put an end to his chaos.",

      "selftext": "Recently the Colombian market has started to rebound mainly due to peso strengthening against a weak dollar and inflows from emerging market investment. Recently the bank of colombia has taken large amounts of external debts at high interest rates artificially propping up the peso making Colombia one of the highest interest payers in dollars in the world relative to their exports. If you look at a 15 year chart comparing $COLO to ClW00(continuous crude oil) you see in 2015 it crashed 70% from the U.s starting to raise rates as well as crude oil prices crashing. If you look at the chart now you can see the huge divergence. I believe the Colombian president is artificially propping up the peso for his party because the election is in a few months as well as this year he raised minimum wage 22% to $550 a month. The economy is incredibly vulnerable with the Colombian bank rate at 9.5% and their inflation sticking at 5%, they will eventually be either forced raising interest rates driving out foreign investment with their unemployment rate already at 8-9% or printing their way out which is a bad idea since their external loans have high interest and their export industry is already struggling.",

      "selftext": "Here is a DD, fellow window lickers. The Europoors have an investible asset for once. The pride of the Italian construction worker & Dubai sheikh. Ferrari: $RACE The most profitable car company on earth by a % basis. Its business model, demand dynamics, and customer behavior place it closer to Hermès than to any mass-market OEM. Hermès trades at roughly fifty times trailing earnings, while Ferrari trades closer to the mid-thirties at the moment. Based on trailing EPS, a Hermès-level earnings multiple would imply a share price roughly sixty percent higher than current levels. The gap is not due to inferior fundamentals, but because the market still partially misclassifies Ferrari as an auto manufacturer rather than a luxury scarcity brand. Ferrari’s demand profile is insulated from the typical macroeconomic pressures that affect the automotive sector. The company sells to high NW buyers whose purchasing power is not meaningfully impacted by interest rates, inflation, or consumer credit conditions. For their customers, availability, allocation, and status matter far more than financing rates or monthly payment considerations, . As a result, revenue stability, pricing power, and margins behave more like high-end luxury goods than cyclical vehicles. Order books remain deep, consistently extending beyond two years. Even in cases where a model receives mixed feedback from enthusiasts, allocations sell out because buyers are playing a longer reputation game. Taking delivery of a less-desired model today increases the probability of earning a rarified allocation tomorrow. This behavior mirrors the Patek Philippe model, where customers accept less sought-after references to build credibility with the brand, and where the real product being sold is not the object itself but the access. Recent analyst downgrades tied to the rollout cadence of the F80 are reflective of short-term sentiment more than any deterioration in operational performance. Delivery expectations have shifted modestly on certain tranches, but projected units, mix, and pricing still support the broader earnings profile. F80 demand remains oversubscribed at the high end, and the release does not carry long-term revenue consequences. The temporary softness in sentiment is a function of modeling timelines rather than weakening fundamentals. The tipping point for the recent stock slide was based on an underinvestment/production reduction in EVs. This should be positive with the current political climate. Regardless, who tf wants a EV Ferrari? It should be easily priced at $500. The drawdown has stabilized with earning ahead, I’m looking for a meaningful push into the low 400 shortly.

Ferrari $ RACE The most profitable car company on earth by a % basis . Its business model demand dynamics and customer behavior place it closer to Hermès than to any massmarket OEM . Hermès trades at roughly fifty times trailing earnings while Ferrari trades closer to the midthirties at the moment . Based on trailing EPS a Hermèslevel earnings multiple would imply a share price roughly sixty percent higher than current levels . The gap is not_due to inferior fundamentals but because the market still partially misclassifies Ferrari as an auto manufacturer rather than a luxury scarcity brand . Ferrari ’ s demand profile is insulated from the typical macroeconomic pressures that affect the automotive sector . The company sells to high NW buyers whose purchasing power is not_meaningfully impacted by interest rates inflation or consumer credit conditions . For their customers availability allocation and status matter far more than financing rates or monthly payment considerations . As a result revenue stability pricing power and margins behave more like highend luxury goods than cyclical vehicles . Order books remain deep consistently extending beyond two years . Even in cases where a model receives mixed feedback from enthusiasts allocations sell out because buyers are playing a longer reputation game . Taking delivery of a lessdesired model today increases the probability of earning a rarified allocation tomorrow . This behavior mirrors the Patek Philippe model where customers accept less soughtafter references to build credibility with the brand and where the real product being sold is not_the object itself but the access . Recent analyst downgrades tied to the rollout cadence of the F80 are reflective of shortterm sentiment more than any deterioration in operational performance . Delivery expectations have shifted modestly on certain tranches but projected units mix and pricing still support the broader earnings profile . F80 demand remains oversubscribed at the high end and the release does not_carry longterm revenue consequences . The temporary softness in sentiment is a function of modeling timelines rather than weakening fundamentals . The tipping point for the recent stock slide was based on an underinvestmentproduction reduction in EVs . This should be positive with the current political climate . Regardless who tf wants a EV Ferrari It should be easily priced at $ 500 . The drawdown has stabilized with earning ahead I ’ m looking for a meaningful push into the low 400 shortly .

      "selftext": "I'm seriously thinking about dumping all my Bitcoin at a loss, but I want to make sure its a good idea first. I've been holding bitcoin at roughly a 24% loss for around 6 months or more, and I'm starting to think it was a bad investment. I was expecting Bitcoin to be a hedge against possible US dollar devaluation and more continued interest in the expansion of Bitcoin investment vehicles like people being able to invest into it with their 401ks. However, Bitcoin hasn't lived up to my expectations. I'll be honest, mostly I invested in Bitcoin because the chart was going up into the right, and up into the right is good lol, but now it isn't. Silver and gold are doing the work of hedging against US dollar devaluation, mainly with major world banks buying it up. The major banks have more power than every day people like you and I, so I can't go against their game. Supposedly JP Morgan is keeping the price of Bitcoin down with them shorting Microstrategy stock (I don't understand this too well I could be wrong). More and more I'm thinking Warren Buffet was right on Bitcoin. What intrinsic value does Bitcoin have? What other major functions can you do with Bitcoin besides buying and holding and then selling later? I know its obviously a currency, but the only other major use case I know of for Bitcoin is buying drugs off the dark web. At least with gold and silver, you can melt it down and make electronics and jewelry. Maybe things will change in the future and Bitcoin will become the world reserve currency replacing the dollar, since you can't really buy goods and services with silver and gold. But then again, maybe someone will come up with another electronic coin backed by gold and silver. I want to know what you guys think. I might have some misconstrued views on Bitcoin and may not be seeing the whole picture.",

So my question isn't so much about what would happen if the US defaulted, but rather, how does one go about analyzing the risk of that happening. And to generalize it even further, how do you perform risk assessments in general, from the downside, to the upside to the catastrophic? I have a few real estate investments and some cash in the market, but most of my decisions are based on the analysis of others. I have never built my own framework for evaluating risk and I'd like to have a better basis for my decisions beyond vibes. Thanks!",

So my question isnt so much about what would happen if the US defaulted but rather how does one go about analyzing the risk of that happening . And to generalize it even further how do you perform risk assessments in general from the downside to the upside to the catastrophic I have a few real estate investments and some cash in the market but most of my decisions are based on the analysis of others . I have never_built my own framework for evaluating risk and Id like to have a better basis for my decisions beyond vibes . Thanks"

      "selftext": "Been digging into Alphabet's financials and wanted to share some findings that go beyond the surface level bullish narrative. This isn't investment advice, just my analysis. The headline numbers look great: Net income up 36% YoY to $100.1B Operating cash flow jumped to $125.3B Stock up \\\\\\\\\\\\\\~65% in 2025 But here's what's getting buried: 1. Free Cash Flow is compressing despite higher earnings CapEx jumped 63% ($32.3B → $52.5B) while cash on hand stayed flat at $23.5B. Net income is up, but FCF margin is declining. That's a red flag most screens won't catch. 2. Hidden leverage nobody talks about Long-term debt looks manageable at $10.9B. But capital lease obligations are $14.6B more than the debt itself. All those data centers aren't free. 3. Liquidity is shifting long-term at the worst time Short-term investments dropped from $86.9B to $72.2B while long-term investments increased. They're locking up liquidity right when CapEx is peaking. 4. AI might cannibalize before it monetizes Here's the contrarian take: AI-generated answers bypass traditional ad clicks. Investors are pricing AI as additive revenue, but it could redistribute value within Google's ecosystem rather than expand it. 5. Receivables growing at revenue pace Receivables up 9% YoY. If those AI/Cloud contracts have delayed payment milestones, working capital strain could hit during any downturn. 6. Governance risk is real Dual-class structure means founders maintain control regardless of what shareholders want. Limited influence on capital allocation or dividend policy. Finding this stuff took hours of digging through filings. If you're a value investor tired of fragmented research and information overload causing you to miss risk signals. There are tools to surface these kinds of non-obvious risks. Anyone else concerned about the CapEx ramp or see it differently?",

      "selftext": "Built a data platform as a side project. Used it to analyse sector rotation patterns across 27 years of S&P 500 sector ETF data. --- **Methodology** - **Data:** S&P 500 Sector SPDR ETFs (XLK, XLE, XLF, XLV, XLY, XLP, XLI, XLB, XLU, XLRE, XLC) - **Period:** 1999-2026 (XLRE from 2015, XLC from 2018) - **Approach:** Rank all sectors by annual return, track year-over-year transitions, count reversals **Why ETFs, not stock averages:** Market-cap weighted. A $3T company has more influence than a $100M micro-cap. I initially used FMP's sector_performance data (simple averages) but got garbage. +73% single-day sector returns from micro-cap noise. ETFs reflect actual investable returns. --- **Results** | Metric | Count | |:-------|:------| | Total year-over-year transitions | 246 | | Bottom-3 → Top-3 next year | 27 (11%) | | Top-3 → Bottom-3 next year | 34 (14%) | | Major reversals (either direction) | 61 (25%) | No sector stayed #1 for more than 2 consecutive years. --- **Recent rankings (2024-2026)** | Year | #1 | #2 | #3 | Worst | |:-----|:---|:---|:---|:------| | 2024 | Comm Services (+36%) | Financials | Consumer Disc | Materials (0%) | | 2025 | Technology (+25%) | Comm Services | Industrials | Utilities (-43%) | | 2026 YTD | Materials (+7%) | Energy | Consumer Staples | Financials (-2%) | Materials: worst in 2024, leading 2026 YTD. The pattern continues. --- **Notable reversals** | Sector | Year 1 | Rank | Year 2 | Rank | |:-------|:-------|:-----|:-------|:-----| | Energy | 2020 | #11 (-33%) | 2021 | #1 (+53%) | | Energy | 2021 | #1 (+53%) | 2022 | #1 (+59%) | | Technology | 1999 | #1 (+63%) | 2000 | #9 (-44%) | | Financials | 2008 | #9 (-54%) | 2012 | #1 (+25%) | --- **SQL** Annual sector ETF returns with rankings: ```sql WITH etf_prices AS ( SELECT symbol, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CAST(date AS DATE)) as year, FIRST(adjClose ORDER BY date) as first_close, LAST(adjClose ORDER BY date) as last_close FROM fmp.stock_eod WHERE symbol IN ('XLK', 'XLE', 'XLF', 'XLV', 'XLY', 'XLP', 'XLI', 'XLB', 'XLU', 'XLRE', 'XLC') GROUP BY symbol, year ) SELECT year, symbol, ROUND((last_close - first_close) / first_close * 100, 1) as return_pct, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY year ORDER BY (last_close - first_close) / first_close DESC) as rank FROM etf_prices ORDER BY year, rank; ``` Count reversal events: ```sql WITH rankings AS ( SELECT symbol, year, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY year ORDER BY (last_close - first_close) / first_close DESC) as rank, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY year) as total_sectors FROM ( SELECT symbol, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CAST(date AS DATE)) as year, FIRST(adjClose ORDER BY date) as first_close, LAST(adjClose ORDER BY date) as last_close FROM fmp.stock_eod WHERE symbol IN ('XLK', 'XLE', 'XLF', 'XLV', 'XLY', 'XLP', 'XLI', 'XLB', 'XLU', 'XLRE', 'XLC') GROUP BY symbol, year ) ), lagged AS ( SELECT a.year, a.symbol, a.rank as this_year_rank, b.rank as last_year_rank, a.total_sectors FROM rankings a LEFT JOIN rankings b ON a.symbol = b.symbol AND a.year = b.year + 1 WHERE b.rank IS NOT NULL ) SELECT COUNT(*) as total_transitions, SUM(CASE WHEN last_year_rank >= total_sectors - 2 AND this_year_rank <= 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as bottom3_to_top3, SUM(CASE WHEN last_year_rank <= 3 AND this_year_rank >= total_sectors - 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as top3_to_bottom3 FROM lagged; ``` --- **What I haven't tested** - Monthly/quarterly rotation signals - Transaction cost impact - Risk-adjusted returns - Optimal holding period after reversal Anyone here trading sector rotation? What signals work for timing entry? --- *Data: FMP. DuckDB on Parquet.*",

A family is considering allocating $1–2 million into a long-term investment vehicle with the objective of generating a sustainable \\~5% annual return while preserving capital. What types of instruments or structures would be appropriate to achieve this goal over a long time horizon? EDIT: Sorry if my post sounded confusing. Background is that I would like to secure my family's future and organize some sort of trust fund or something like that so we would have some sort of passive income. I now use CDs but the rates are not great and they will probably go lower. I want to keep 5% at min, and I would like to increase the asset base (insh) in the coming years. So that's the background. I am not familiar with any firms or advisors, so I think I will talk to Schwab or someone similar. Anyone who gave advice, I am greatful. I am a trader and I have been in the markets since 2013. Actively since 2017, and I am 42. So trying to plan my fams future. That's it. Don't want to take market risk, as I have plenty of capital under risk daily anyways.",

      "selftext": "I would like some advice on my 2 options calls for Planet Labs (PL). Since the government shutdown might be real soon. 1: PL 25 Call EXP: Apr.17.2026 bought for 1.37. It’s @ 4.80 yesterday was 6.00. 2: PL 36 Call EXP: May.15.2026 bought for 2.85 It’s @ 2.10 yesterday was 2.80. Personally I love this company and will be investing long term. If you guys can help that would be great but no pressure. My question is 1) How bad would PL be affected by the government shutdown If it happens, I imagine pretty bad right? 2) If a government shutdown occurs that would lead me to believe we entered a bearish market? 3) Should I just sell or hold? I don’t mind selling and I am more worried about waiting. Hope you guys/gals have a good one!",

      "selftext": "Looks like he's not done trying to rally gold after his weekend threat against Canada. Load up on your stocks boys because it'll be TACO Tuesday tomorrow [From NBC]( President Donald Trump said Monday that he was hiking tariffs on imports from South Korea to 25% from 15%, complaining that the nation's legislature wasn't \"living up\" to a trade deal that was struck last year. \"Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%,\" Trump wrote in a social media post. Trump's announcement comes as he also contends with blowback from voters on affordability and the cost of living. His tariffs have contributed to stubborn price inflation, and recent research says consumers have shouldered nearly all of costs from the duties. South Korea is an important trading partner for the United States, ranking among the top 10 sources of imports. Nearly $150 billion worth of goods is imported every year from South Korea to the U.S. by companies and consumers. In July, Trump reached what he called a trade deal with South Korea's president. However, the two sides then remained deadlocked for months over an investment pledge that the U.S. pushed for. Then in October, during Trump's Asia trip, he and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung finalized that deal, which included a promise of investing $350 billion in the U.S. Weeks later, in November, the White House and South Korean government released a \"fact sheet\" that was set to put the deal in motion. [Edit] For anyone interested, in an attempt to keep track of the tariff nonsense, I've setup r/TrumpTariffTracker. Any help setting it up is appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "Looks like hes not_done trying to rally gold after his weekend threat against Canada . Load up on your stocks boys because itll be TACO Tuesday tomorrow From NBC President Donald Trump said Monday that he was hiking tariffs on imports from South Korea to 25 % from 15 % complaining that the nations legislature wasnt living up to a trade deal that was struck last year . Because the Korean Legislature hasnt enacted our Historic Trade Agreement which is their prerogative I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos Lumber Pharma and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS from 15 % to 25 % Trump wrote in a social media post . Trumps announcement comes as he also contends with blowback from voters on affordability and the cost of living . His tariffs have contributed to stubborn price inflation and recent research says consumers have shouldered nearly all of costs from the duties . South Korea is an important trading partner for the United States ranking among the top 10 sources of imports . Nearly $ 150 billion worth of goods is imported every year from South Korea to the U.S. by companies and consumers . In July Trump reached what he called a trade deal with South Koreas president . However the two sides then remained deadlocked for months over an investment pledge that the U.S. pushed for . Then in October during Trumps Asia trip he and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung finalized that deal which included a promise of investing $ 350 billion in the U.S . Weeks later in November the White House and South Korean government released a fact sheet that was set to put the deal in motion . Edit For anyone interested in an attempt to keep track of the tariff nonsense Ive setup rTrumpTariffTracker . Any help setting it up is appreciated ."

Last week it was the threat of taking Greenland, the market dipped and he quickly walked back any idea of taking Greenland by force and announced a 'framework' for securing the country. Another threat, another market dip, another TACO moment. But something felt different this time. It was almost like it was the last straw. This past weekend, he threatened 100% tariffs on Canada, but by today there was no market reaction to the news. Was it because the threat resolved itself before today, or is it because the market finally knows what we all do: the threats are hollow and short-lived? I guess we'll find out after next weekend's threat. ETA: I did not mean did the market turn a corner, but have we turned a corner on kneejerk reactions to the tweets and threats. Obviously, the market will continue to be volatile and never really 'turns a corner.'",

      "selftext": "There's something truly different about gold/metals ATH right now. As many have pointed out, these are safe haven assets. When there is turmoil in the world, when the value of government currencies are uncertain, equities are uncertain, this is where the money flows. Can't make more of it, no government can affect it, can hold, can travel. EDIT Previous highs, like the 70's, functioned in this way. Gold at all time highs. Equities in the cellar, bonds in the cellar. The dollar was weak and losing credibility — that's what drove gold up. Critically, central banks weren't buying gold back then — many were selling or holding, believing the price had gotten too high. The rally was driven purely by private investors panicking about inflation. Eventually, Volcker jacked rates to 20%, which crushed inflation, strengthened the dollar, and brought strong demand for US treasury bills back. Gold then entered a 20-year bear market, with central banks continuing to sell throughout the 80s and 90s (most famously, the UK dumped half its reserves at the bottom in 1999). In the 70's we were in stagflation (high inflation low growth) in the US though, so interest rates were rising to try to limit inflation, but inflation remained high and growth was low... so demand for t bills was still weak, high inflation. So the fed made a crazy move - pegged interest to 20%. This killed inflation, and brought strong interest back to the dollar, and gold went into a 20 year decline. They can't do that anymore. The US has gotten into a situation where the treasury needs to service debt more than a third of our annual GDP. How do we service that debt? We issue more bonds. If those bonds paid 20%, we'd go bankrupt. So back to the beginning, what's special about right now. We have never had this situation. Equities are near all time highs. CAPE, which measures P/E ratio of the market, is over 40 for the second time in history, implying very high valuations. The buffet factor, which compares GDP to the value of stocks is at 224%, the highest ever. And we know metals are also at ATH's. What is happening? Everyone knows the fed sets interest rates, but in the 90's, Japan taught all the feds around the world a new trick. Treasury issues bonds. Fed buys them. They just create the money and give it to the treasury. They collect payments. Then they send the interest collected back to the treasury. US does this the most, but everyone has allowed it because there's no better currency. When COVID hit, the fed kicked this into high gear to prevent recession. In one month, they bought $1.3T of bonds (April 2020). They agree to buy $120B per month thereafter. In the last five years, the money in the world has increased from $15T >>> $22T. This is unprecedented, and rightfully so, countries' central banks were feeling like the dollar may be a little less safe if they're just going apeshit printing money. (Also that COVID money went straight to people via stimulus checks and PPP \"loans\" that were forgiven --->> all that extra money drove up equities, properties, groceries... it's the root of the hyper inflation.) Ok we're almost there. 2022. Russia invades Ukraine. US freezes $300B of Russia's dollars. OH shit the dollar isn't what it used to be they are printing it like mad and if they don't like us they can just cancel it. Central banks changed their rainy day fund strategy. Instead of buying \\~400 tons of gold per year (about 12% of demand) they started buying 1200 tons - 25% of demand in 2024. Now they are buying 900. They are only buying less because the price is up, they don't care about the price they are buying anyway. Jewelry is still buying the same 1200 tons regardless of price. Retail is buying 1000 tons because of the same reason central banks are, and industry can't buy less. They are buying less treasury bonds. So the dollar has fallen 15% in the last year. Tariffs just making it worse for the dollar. So why would this stop? US deficit just got way bigger with the big beautiful bill. Which means more t bills, and the interest rate is starting to divorce from fed rate changes because there is too much supply. They can't raise interest rates like the 70's. If stagflation hits (low growth, high unemployment AND high inflation) we are fucked. Remember our clever friend Japan? Well they just kept buying their t bills. Then they started buying nikkei stocks too. They hold 226% of their gdp in debt, interest is zero, and the yen is cratering. (One of the only places to take your dollar on vacation right now, FYI.) Stocks WILL drop - who knows when exactly, but the highest CAPE ever was 44 in the dotcom era, we're at 40+. Oh and another record - $1.3T of those stocks are leveraged. When the drop happens where is the safe haven now? Dollar is no longer safe haven. This is why I think gold, silver, platinum could double again. Side note: as soon as the world accepts bitcoin does in fact check every box gold does in these situations I think it goes apeshit too. Signs are already there - in October is started behaving a little differently - it's not a high risk asset that should track equities, it's a safety asset. Quantum computing the core risk there IMO.",

      "selftext_processed": "Theres something truly different about goldmetals ATH right now . As many have pointed out these are safe haven assets . When there is turmoil in the world when the value of government currencies are uncertain equities are uncertain this is where the money flows . Cant make more of it no_government can affect it can hold can travel . EDIT Previous highs like the 70s functioned in this way . Gold at all time highs . Equities in the cellar bonds in the cellar . The dollar was weak and losing credibility — thats what drove gold up . Critically central banks werent buying gold back then — many were selling or holding believing the price had gotten too high . The rally was driven purely by private investors panicking about inflation . Eventually Volcker jacked rates to 20 % which crushed inflation strengthened the dollar and brought strong demand for US treasury bills back . Gold then entered a 20year bear market with central banks continuing to sell throughout the 80s and 90s most famously the UK dumped half its reserves at the bottom in 1999 . In the 70s we were in stagflation high inflation low growth in the US though so interest rates were rising to try to limit inflation but inflation remained high and growth was low ... so demand for t bills was still weak high inflation . So the fed made a crazy move pegged interest to 20 % . This killed inflation and brought strong interest back to the dollar and gold went into a 20 year decline . They cant do that anymore . The US has gotten into a situation where the treasury needs to service debt more than a third of our annual GDP . How do we service that debt We issue more bonds . If those bonds paid 20 % wed go bankrupt . So back to the beginning whats special about right now . We have never_had this situation . Equities are near all time highs . CAPE which measures PE ratio of the market is over 40 for the second time in history implying very high valuations . The buffet factor which compares GDP to the value of stocks is at 224 % the highest ever . And we know metals are also at ATHs . What is happening Everyone knows the fed sets interest rates but in the 90s Japan taught all the feds around the world a new trick . Treasury issues bonds . Fed buys them . They just create the money and give it to the treasury . They collect payments . Then they send the interest collected back to the treasury . US does this the most but everyone has allowed it because theres no_better currency . When COVID hit the fed kicked this into high gear to prevent recession . In one month they bought $ 1.3T of bonds April 2020 . They agree to buy $ 120B per month thereafter . In the last five years the money in the world has increased from $ 15T $ 22T . This is unprecedented and rightfully so countries central banks were feeling like the dollar may be a little less safe if theyre just going apeshit printing money . Also that COVID money went straight to people via stimulus checks and PPP loans that were forgiven all that extra money drove up equities properties groceries ... its the root of the hyper inflation . Ok were almost there . 2022 . Russia invades Ukraine . US freezes $ 300B of Russias dollars . OH shit the dollar isnt what it used to be they are printing it like mad and if they dont like us they can just cancel it . Central banks changed their rainy day fund strategy . Instead of buying 400 tons of gold per year about 12 % of demand they started buying 1200 tons 25 % of demand in 2024 . Now they are buying 900 . They are only buying less because the price is up they dont care about the price they are buying anyway . Jewelry is still buying the same 1200 tons regardless of price . Retail is buying 1000 tons because of the same reason central banks are and industry cant buy less . They are buying less treasury bonds . So the dollar has fallen 15 % in the last year . Tariffs just making it worse for the dollar . So why would this stop US deficit just got way bigger with the big beautiful bill . Which means more t bills and the interest rate is starting to divorce from fed rate changes because there is too much supply . They cant raise interest rates like the 70s . If stagflation hits low growth high unemployment AND high inflation we are fucked . Remember our clever friend Japan Well they just kept buying their t bills . Then they started buying nikkei stocks too . They hold 226 % of their gdp in debt interest is zero and the yen is cratering . One of the only places to take your dollar on vacation right now FYI . Stocks WILL drop who knows when exactly but the highest CAPE ever was 44 in the dotcom era were at 40 . Oh and another record $ 1.3T of those stocks are leveraged . When the drop happens where is the safe haven now Dollar is no_longer safe haven . This is why I think gold silver platinum could double again . Side note as soon as the world accepts bitcoin does in fact check every box gold does in these situations I think it goes apeshit too . Signs are already there in October is started behaving a little differently its not_a high risk asset that should track equities its a safety asset . Quantum computing the core risk there IMO ."

      "selftext": "Nike is cutting 775 employees as the company looks to boost its bottom line and accelerate its use of “automation,” CNBC has learned. The layoffs, which are in addition to the 1,000 corporate job cuts the company announced last summer, primarily impact distribution center roles in Tennessee and Mississippi, where the sneaker giant operates large warehouses, people familiar with the matter said. In a statement to CNBC, Nike said the layoffs primarily affect its U.S. distribution operations and are designed to “reduce complexity, improve flexibility, and build a more responsive, resilient, responsible, and efficient operation.” “We’re taking steps to strengthen and streamline our operations so we can move faster, operate with greater discipline, and better serve athletes and consumers,” Nike said in the statement. “We are sharpening our supply chain footprint, accelerating the use of advanced technology and automation, and investing in the skills our teams need for the future.” Source: [",

      "selftext": "TLDR: in September Snapchat announced that users with more than 5GB of memories would have to start paying on a monthly basis or their excess photos/videos would be deleted in September 2026. Users were outraged; investors seem to think it will flop. But I manually collected data that suggests otherwise: **EDIT: I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning. Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat+ revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts. This will address the main complaints from your comments.** I was using Snapchat last weekend when I tapped on my memories and discovered that Snapchat gave me a figure for how many of my friends are already subscribed to Snapchat+ ($5/mo standard rate)... So I started asking everyone on my friends list to tell me how many total friends they have vs how many of their friends subscribe to Snapchat+. This got me to 5.5k total friends of friends. Then I hopped on Omegle for a few hours and asked a bunch of strangers for their data. That’s how I got to 13k+ total friends of friends. “Other Revenue” from the Q3 2025 10-Q was $189M and stated as “majority coming from Snapchat+”. It accounted for 9% of total revenue. According to demandsage (dot) com, Snapchat+ had 17M subscribers as of the Q3 Earnings report. **477M Daily Active Users -> 3.56% of DAUs were subscribed. At 900M Monthly Users -> 1.88% of MAUs were subscribed** (MAUs may be a more effective metric. See end). **And Subscription revenue is often valued twice as much as ad revenue.** **Sources of Error:** * “Total users” from the polling includes inactive accounts. This is why I suspect Snap+/MAUs is a better comparison than DAUs (the Snapchat+ rate as a percentage of DAUs could be higher than the sample). * Snapchat Platinum ($15/mo) and the cheaper storage option ($2/mo) are both excluded. * Subscription rates (as a percentage of users) could go up even more over the year as the memory deletion date (Sep 2026) approaches. * Snap gives discounts when buying annually as opposed to monthly. **Of course, the sample size is only a fraction of the total user base.** **And that’s where the regard army comes in.** Help me take this from 13k to 100k+ datapoints. Regards, I call upon thee! **HOW TO FIND HOW MANY FRIENDS HAVE SNAPCHAT+** Step 1: Go to your profile and tap on the “Try Snapchat+” button at the top. NOTE: Only appears for users who don’t have Snapchat+. Step 2: Write down the circled number. If it doesn’t appear, restart the app and try again. **HOW TO FIND YOUR TOTAL FRIEND COUNT:** Step 1: Click this smiley face in the bottom right of the main screen Step 2: Search for “How many” and click the first filter. Write down the number above your head. **Please put your stats in the comments!** If you include your age and rough location, I’ll add your data to my dataset. My hunch is that older folks will have lower total friend count and percent of snapchat+ users. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH** **EDIT: I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning. Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat+ revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts. This should address the main complaints from your comments.**",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR in September Snapchat announced that users with more than 5GB of memories would have to start paying on a monthly basis or their excess photosvideos would be deleted in September 2026 . Users were outraged investors seem to think it will flop . But I manually collected data that suggests otherwise EDIT I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning . Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts . This will address the main complaints from your comments . I was using Snapchat last weekend when I tapped on my memories and discovered that Snapchat gave me a figure for how many of my friends are already subscribed to Snapchat $ 5mo standard rate ... So I started asking everyone on my friends list to tell me how many total friends they have vs how many of their friends subscribe to Snapchat . This got me to 5.5k total friends of friends . Then I hopped on Omegle for a few hours and asked a bunch of strangers for their data . That ’ s how I got to 13k total friends of friends . “ Other Revenue ” from the Q3 2025 10Q was $ 189M and stated as “ majority coming from Snapchat ” . It accounted for 9 % of total revenue . According to demandsage dot com Snapchat had 17M subscribers as of the Q3 Earnings report . 477M Daily Active Users 3.56 % of DAUs were subscribed . At 900M Monthly Users 1.88 % of MAUs were subscribed MAUs may be a more effective metric . See end . And Subscription revenue is often valued twice as much as ad revenue . Sources of Error “ Total users ” from the polling includes inactive accounts . This is why I suspect SnapMAUs is a better comparison than DAUs the Snapchat rate as a percentage of DAUs could be higher than the sample . Snapchat Platinum $ 15mo and the cheaper storage option $ 2mo are both excluded . Subscription rates as a percentage of users could go up even more over the year as the memory deletion date Sep 2026 approaches . Snap gives discounts when buying annually as opposed to monthly . Of course the sample size is only a fraction of the total user base . And that ’ s where the regard army comes in . Help me take this from 13k to 100k datapoints . Regards I call upon thee HOW TO FIND HOW MANY FRIENDS HAVE SNAPCHAT Step 1 Go to your profile and tap on the “ Try Snapchat ” button at the top . NOTE Only appears for users who don ’ t have Snapchat . Step 2 Write down the circled number . If it doesn ’ t appear restart the app and try again . HOW TO FIND YOUR TOTAL FRIEND COUNT Step 1 Click this smiley face in the bottom right of the main screen Step 2 Search for “ How many ” and click the first filter . Write down the number above your head . Please put your stats in the comments If you include your age and rough location I ’ ll add your data to my dataset . My hunch is that older folks will have lower total friend count and percent of snapchat users . DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH EDIT I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning . Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts . This should address the main complaints from your comments ."

      "selftext": "The market is currently fixated on the GPU (Nvidia) and the HBM (SK Hynix/Micron), ignoring a critical bottleneck in the advanced packaging layer. Entire AI supply chain, from Blackwell to Apple’s M series is currently being choked by a specific type of fiberglass fabric that basically only one Japanese company knows how to make properly. And they are sold out until 2027. The general assumption is that an H100/Blackwell GPU is just silicon, but the chip sits on a substrate (that green board). If that board warps when it gets hot during reflow, the chip cracks and dies. To prevent warping, you need Low CTE Glass (often called \"T-Glass\"), which is currently manufactured by Nittobo (Japan) which is currently sold out, hence Apple/Qualcomm are now fighting NVIDIA for supply. Taiwas Glass ) spent the last two years retrofitting their furnaces to crack the \"T-Glass\" recipe. They just approved a $2.25 Billion NTD expansion specifically for electronic grade yarn. Reports from DigiTimes and local supply chain checks confirm Nvidia and Unimicron execs have been at Taiwan Glass HQ. They need a second source to reduce risk. Also, they are the only non Chinese option. US sanctions block the mainland Chinese alternatives, and Nittobo is maxed out. Taiwan Glass is right next door to the substrate packagers (Unimicron, Nan Ya). The stock is up 200% over the last year, but that was just insider accumulation front running the qualification news. Nittobo (Japan) didn't stop at a 2x; it pulled a 5 bagger once it was fully priced as an AI stock. As soon as Taiwasn Glass reports meaningful revenue from the electronic materials division (likely Q1/Q2 2026), the algos will have to rerate this as a tech material stock. \\*\\*TLDR\\*\\* Entire AI GPU industry is dependent on ultrarigid glass fabric which only one Japanese company knows how to make perfectly and it is already sold out till 2027. Taiwan Glass is their new competitor and is already engaged with NVIDIA in talks to buy from them. I am 15k shares long on Taiwan Glass Ind. Corp. (1802.TW)",

      "selftext_processed": "The market is currently fixated on the GPU Nvidia and the HBM SK HynixMicron ignoring a critical bottleneck in the advanced packaging layer . Entire AI supply chain from Blackwell to Apple ’ s M series is currently being choked by a specific type of fiberglass fabric that basically only one Japanese company knows how to make properly . And they are sold out until 2027 . The general assumption is that an H100Blackwell GPU is just silicon but the chip sits on a substrate that green board . If that board warps when it gets hot during reflow the chip cracks and dies . To prevent warping you need Low CTE Glass often called TGlass which is currently manufactured by Nittobo Japan which is currently sold out hence AppleQualcomm are now fighting NVIDIA for supply . Taiwas Glass spent the last two years retrofitting their furnaces to crack the TGlass recipe . They just approved a $ 2.25 Billion NTD expansion specifically for electronic grade yarn . Reports from DigiTimes and local supply chain checks confirm Nvidia and Unimicron execs have been at Taiwan Glass HQ . They need a second source to reduce risk . Also they are the only non Chinese option . US sanctions block the mainland Chinese alternatives and Nittobo is maxed out . Taiwan Glass is right next door to the substrate packagers Unimicron Nan Ya . The stock is up 200 % over the last year but that was just insider accumulation front running the qualification news . Nittobo Japan didnt stop at a 2x it pulled a 5 bagger once it was fully priced as an AI stock . As soon as Taiwasn Glass reports meaningful revenue from the electronic materials division likely Q1Q2 2026 the algos will have to rerate this as a tech material stock . TLDR Entire AI GPU industry is dependent on ultrarigid glass fabric which only one Japanese company knows how to make perfectly and it is already sold out till 2027 . Taiwan Glass is their new competitor and is already engaged with NVIDIA in talks to buy from them . I am 15k shares long on Taiwan Glass Ind . Corp. 1802.TW"

      "selftext": "I am in love with the stock market and I recently came up with (what I think may be) a fun idea: A website/app for ranked trading and investing. Here's the rundown: \\- You connect your broker account or manually input all positions to track your portfolio \\- There will be daily, weekly, monthly and YTD leaderboards based on your return. \\-From there it's simple, outperform 90% of other investors in the time period? You get a high rank and officially earn bragging rights. Blow 100% of your portfolio buying penny stocks with 1000x leverage? You get a low rank and get shamed by other users. Personally, I think this will be great, it gamifies the stock market and allows you and your friends to get a little more competitive. I do have some other ideas as well, however these do stray a little from the core of the idea: \\- Social feed to share ideas on your stock picks \\- Built in news tab \\- A daily quiz about recent news, where correct answers grant you entries into prize draws. \\- Built-in trading companions to win prizes. I'm really excited about this idea and I would love to make it happen. If there's any feedback you have please let me know in the comments.",

      "title": "BMBL struggles with revenue decline despite cost cuts and balance sheet improvements",
      "selftext": "Bumble Inc BMBL has been trading near multiyear lows recently, around 3.55 to 3.60 USD, reflecting pressure from declining revenue and changing user metrics. Over the past year, the stock has fallen sharply from previous highs, while management has taken steps to cut costs and improve financial flexibility. For context, Q3 2025 revenue came in at about 246.2 million USD, down roughly 10 percent year over year, with Bumble App revenue declining to 199 million USD per last 10-Q. Earlier quarters showed similar trends, with Q1 2025 revenue around 247 million USD, also down compared to prior periods. Total paying users have decreased slightly, though management is focusing on engagement quality and product updates to stabilize this metric. On the cost side, Bumble reduced its global workforce by approximately 240 positions in early 2025, representing about 30 percent of staff, which management expects to generate roughly 40 million USD in annualized savings. The company also settled a tax receivable obligation at a discount, paying 186 million USD versus a 419 million USD carrying value. This move improves long-term flexibility, although user growth and revenue trends remain headwinds. Leadership changes have also shaped recent strategy. CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd returned in early 2025 to guide the company, and the Chief Product Officer recently departed as part of a reorganization under a single product leader. These moves indicate a focus on streamlining decision-making and product execution. From a trading perspective, BMBL has shown elevated volatility around earnings reports and announcements, with technical support near multiyear lows around 3.50 USD and resistance near prior highs in the 4.50–5.00 USD range. Volume has been uneven, suggesting cautious participation from investors. Long-term considerations include the strength of the Bumble brand in online dating and the potential for engagement and monetization improvements, balanced against revenue declines, reduced paying users, and ongoing competition in the social and dating app market. Execution on product updates and user retention will be critical to any recovery. Not financial advice. This is a neutral summary based on recent filings and public news. Do you think BMBL can stabilize revenue and user metrics with these changes, or is the declining trend likely to continue?",

      "selftext": "If you want to last, **cheat the institutions**. Not by fighting them. By **observing them**. Tether purchased 27 tons of gold in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the acquisition currently valued at approximately $4.4 billion according to Reuters. This purchase follows a 26-ton acquisition in Q3 2025, bringing Tether's total reported gold holdings to over 140 tons. In the same quarter, Tether also acquired 8,888 Bitcoin worth about $850 million. We can talk all day about strategies, indicators, setups. But one thing is certain: institutions don’t just set the direction, they almost always **hold the best cards**. They see it first. They position first. And most importantly, they never get attached to a narrative. While many were still debating, **gold printed a new ATH at 5100**. And that didn’t happen by accident. Tether, on its side, positioned itself **at the right time**: 27 tons of gold bought in Q4 2025. No tweet. No speech. Just action. Now, with the current headlines, I honestly think this is **only the beginning**. Intel stock took its share, dropping -17% in a single day. At that point, it became very clear to me that I had made the right decision by getting out and focusing only on the short term, using Bitget Stock Futures for easy entries, trading long or short Temporarily. The entire market could react even worse with what’s coming: tariffs, politics, macro, liquidity. And that’s where my real questions begin: **Gold at 5100 is it still possible to enter?** **Is this really the right moment to take a position?**",

Tether purchased 27 tons of gold in the fourth quarter of 2025 with the acquisition currently valued at approximately $ 4.4 billion according to Reuters . This purchase follows a 26ton acquisition in Q3 2025 bringing Tethers total reported gold holdings to over 140 tons . In the same quarter Tether also acquired 8888 Bitcoin worth about $ 850 million . We can talk all day about strategies indicators setups . But one thing is certain institutions don ’ t just set the direction they almost always hold the best cards . They see it first . They position first . And most importantly they never_get attached to a narrative . While many were still debating gold printed a new ATH at 5100 . And that didn ’ t happen by accident . Tether on its side positioned itself at the right time 27 tons of gold bought in Q4 2025 . No_tweet . No_speech . Just action . Now with the current headlines I honestly think this is only the beginning . Intel stock took its share dropping 17 % in a single day . At that point it became very clear to me that I had made the right decision by getting out and focusing only on the short term using Bitget Stock Futures for easy entries trading long or short Temporarily . The entire market could react even worse with what ’ s coming tariffs politics macro liquidity . And that ’ s where my real questions begin Gold at 5100 is it still possible to enter Is this really the right moment to take a position"

Booz Allen Hamilton’s stock price dropped by more than 10% on the heels of the Treasury Department’s announcement. > The department said it currently has 31 separate contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, totaling $4.8 million in annual spending and $21 million in total obligations. “President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans’ trust in government,” Bessent said in a statement. “Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service,” he said. > The department noted that between 2018 and 2020, Booz Allen employee Charles Edward Littlejohn “stole and leaked the confidential tax returns and return information of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers.” The data breach affected about 406,000 taxpayers, according to the IRS.",

Most of them are doing ok ok but nothing great. I have added some dividend ETFs/Stocks - O, SCHD, DGRO, SPYD, QQQI etc - This I mainly concentrated in Roth accounts Also timing wise should I wait until this earnings season? Should I add some when shutdown begins? I am waiting for some comments from Trump so that I can add few !! LOL",

This mining company I found very interesting and still very undervalued in my opinion based on revenue and production and growth potential. The company plans to double its metal output for this year (2026). They produced over 800k oz of silver last year. Which is just one of the metals that they mine. I haven’t seen any threads about this company and would like to start one. Thanks! I really think it worth looking into. Do your own DD! Founded/Incorporated: 2009. Headquarters: Vancouver, Canada.

      "title": "$NOW (ServiceNow): premium valuation, but elite fundamentals",
      "selftext": "($NOW) and I’m curious why it gets relatively little attention compared to more visible AI or semiconductor names. A few fundamentals that stand out to me: • \\~20–21% subscription revenue growth at large scale • Renewal rate consistently around 97–98% • Non-GAAP operating margin above 30% • Strong free cash flow generation (\\~30%+ FCF margin annually) • RPO and cRPO both growing >20% YoY, giving solid revenue visibility What I like is that this isn’t an “AI hype” story. AI is embedded into existing enterprise workflows (IT, HR, finance, customer operations) that companies already rely on. These are mission-critical systems with high switching costs, which explains the low churn and steady expansion within accounts. Valuation is clearly premium, so this isn’t a cheap stock. But the combination of durable growth, margin expansion and predictable cash flow makes it look more like a long-term compounder than a short-term trade. I recently started building a position and plan to add on pullbacks rather than chase momentum. Curious how others here see $NOW: • Worth the premium vs peers like Salesforce? • Any long-term risks I might be underestimating? Not investment advice, just sharing research and looking for different perspectives.",

      "selftext": "Spent a long time hand picking these by going one by one through thinkorswim and looking for solid companies that have bottomed and are showing strong Nikki’s momentum going forward. Each has a great near term opportunity but would also be good long term holds. Options are cheaper here than other popular names from social media and offer a higher near term upside. Good luck out there. Worked hard on this. ACN: Accenture plc Accenture is making strong progress with AI, showing a 10% year-over-year increase in managed services and better operating margins expected in fiscal 2026. The technical indicators also suggest potential for further gains, supported by solid volume and momentum. ADP: Automatic Data Processing ADP is a reliable performer with consistent earnings and dividends, setting up for about 31% total returns in 2026 due to steady growth and an attractive entry point from recent market dips. AJG: Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Gallagher continues to grow through acquisitions, with organic expansion and likely earnings beats ahead. Analysts anticipate positive results next week, reinforced by a favorable overall outlook. BIIB: Biogen Inc. Biogen’s pipeline is advancing, including EU approval for a high-dose version of Spinraza, which strengthens the positive outlook. Combined with stable earnings and a recent 9% stock rise, it points to recovery potential. BRO: Brown & Brown, Inc. Brown & Brown maintains steady organic growth, enhanced by a new healthcare platform and a recent dividend increase. These developments should bolster the positive case moving forward. CHDN: Churchill Downs Incorporated Churchill Downs benefits from its strong brand and investments in luxury experiences like Derby suites, along with share buybacks that have reduced outstanding shares by 30% over the past decade. Analysts expect a higher valuation from new track developments. CLX: The Clorox Company Clorox is trading at an attractive 16 times forward earnings, given its over 35% return on invested capital. The lower multiples offer value, and consistent demand for household essentials should drive a recovery. CMG: Chipotle Mexican Grill Chipotle’s long-term potential remains clear despite economic challenges, with strong operations and a reset in valuation creating an opportunity to buy. The focus is on continued growth beyond temporary issues like reduced customer traffic. CNC: Centene Corporation Centene appears undervalued at current multiples, with stable earnings and the possibility of trading at 14 times 2026 earnings per share. While there are government-related risks, improvements in margins could shift sentiment positively. CPRT: Copart, Inc. Copart holds a leading position in global auctions with over 300,000 buyers ensuring strong liquidity advantages, high margins, and sustainable growth. Its careful cash management supports a solid positive outlook. DECK: Deckers Outdoor Corporation Deckers could see sales growth if lower interest rates encourage consumer spending in 2026. Even with cautious guidance, the brand’s resilience and undervaluation suggest significant potential upside. FDS: FactSet Research Systems FactSet’s first-quarter margins and a win with Barclays highlight improving profitability, while momentum indicators point to long-term gains.

      "selftext": "I landed an analyst role at a small but ambitious firm. What I’ve seen there has honestly confused me. I’m trying to figure out whether this is something interesting or just a clever idea that doesn’t hold up in the real world. This firm isn’t focused on the usual private equity, venture capital, or hedge fund activities. They’re not betting on growth stories, turnarounds, or “great management teams.” Their entire thesis is built on one uncomfortable idea: Public markets have many companies trading for less than what they already own. Not “undervalued future potential.” Not “great product, bad quarter.” It’s literally cash, securities, or other liquid assets on the balance sheet that exceed the company’s market cap. The types of companies they look at are usually: \\- Cash-burning \\- Strategically dead or stuck in R&D limbo \\- Unloved by the market But still public, regulated, and liquid. Instead of trying to fix these businesses, the idea is much colder: Buy control or influence, shut down what doesn’t work, liquidate or distribute assets, and turn that “trapped” public-market capital into cash. So far, that part at least makes sense to me. Where I start to feel conflicted is what comes next. They don’t just liquidate, return cash, and move on. The idea is to pool the realized capital into a permanent public vehicle that: \\- Recycles that capital repeatedly \\- Tries to use equity more than debt \\- Focuses on growing NAV per share, not revenue or EPS optics \\- Allocates part of the treasury into Bitcoin (which I know is controversial) The internal framing is basically: “We’re arbitraging public-market mispricing, not running operating companies.” No hero CEOs. No turnaround fantasies. No “this biotech pipeline will work eventually.” Just: buy assets cheaper than they’re worth, realize value, redeploy, repeat. Apparently, there’s historical precedent for this working in individual cases discounts to NAV closing, liquidations happening, and capital being returned. What’s less clear to me is whether this works systematically and at scale, especially when you try to keep recycling capital within one structure. On one hand, the logic feels clean. It avoids a lot of operational execution risk and doesn’t rely on market optimism just arithmetic. On the other hand, public markets are messy: Boards resist. Shareholder votes take time. Regulators interfere. Discounts don’t always close. Cash burn and dilution can quietly eat the upside. Once you start recycling instead of returning capital, timing and incentives suddenly matter a lot more. So I’m not posting this to promote anything. I’m genuinely trying to build judgment early and would appreciate reality checks. For people who’ve seen similar strategies up close: Does public-market NAV arbitrage actually scale as a long-term strategy? Is capital recycling inside a permanent structure where this usually breaks? Or is this one of those ideas that looks elegant on paper but gets crushed by time, politics, and dead capital? I’d really appreciate blunt feedback. If this is naive, I’d prefer to learn that now.",

I ’ m trying to figure out whether this is something interesting or just a clever idea that doesn ’ t hold up in the real world . This firm isn ’ t focused on the usual private equity venture capital or hedge fund activities . They ’ re not_betting on growth stories turnarounds or “ great management teams. ” Their entire thesis is built on one uncomfortable idea Public markets have many companies trading for less than what they already own . Not_ “ undervalued future potential. ” Not_ “ great product bad quarter. ” It ’ s literally cash securities or other liquid assets on the balance sheet that exceed the company ’ s market cap . The types of companies they look at are usually Cashburning Strategically dead or stuck in RD limbo Unloved by the market But still public regulated and liquid . Instead of trying to fix these businesses the idea is much colder Buy control or influence shut down what doesn ’ t work liquidate or distribute assets and turn that “ trapped ” publicmarket capital into cash . So far that part at least makes sense to me . Where I start to feel conflicted is what comes next . They don ’ t just liquidate return cash and move on . The idea is to pool the realized capital into a permanent public vehicle that Recycles that capital repeatedly Tries to use equity more than debt Focuses on growing NAV per share not_revenue or EPS optics Allocates part of the treasury into Bitcoin which I know is controversial The internal framing is basically “ We ’ re arbitraging publicmarket mispricing not_running operating companies. ” No_hero CEOs . No_turnaround fantasies . No_ “ this biotech pipeline will work eventually. ” Just buy assets cheaper than they ’ re worth realize value redeploy repeat . Apparently there ’ s historical precedent for this working in individual cases discounts to NAV closing liquidations happening and capital being returned . What ’ s less clear to me is whether this works systematically and at scale especially when you try to keep recycling capital within one structure . On one hand the logic feels clean . It avoids a lot of operational execution risk and doesn ’ t rely on market optimism just arithmetic . On the other hand public markets are messy Boards resist . Shareholder votes take time . Regulators interfere . Discounts don ’ t always close . Cash burn and dilution can quietly eat the upside . Once you start recycling instead of returning capital timing and incentives suddenly matter a lot more . So I ’ m not_posting this to promote anything . I ’ m genuinely trying to build judgment early and would appreciate reality checks . For people who ’ ve seen similar strategies up close Does publicmarket NAV arbitrage actually scale as a longterm strategy Is capital recycling inside a permanent structure where this usually breaks Or is this one of those ideas that looks elegant on paper but gets crushed by time politics and dead capital I ’ d really appreciate blunt feedback . If this is naive I ’ d prefer to learn that now ."

They don't make their own memory modules, so they are very much under the boot of big data centers buying up all the wafers and memory modules at the moment. But once that supply unblocks their COGS will drop dramatically, at which point I'm betting on a considerable stock rebound. What other stocks are dramatically down right now because they can't get their much-needed supplies due to data center demand saturation?",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Shares of CoreWeave popped 8% in premarket trading on Monday after Nvidia announced it has invested $2 billion in the artificial intelligence infrastructure provider. >Nvidia purchased CoreWeave Class A common stock at $87.20 per share, according to a release. The share price is a discount from Friday’s closing price of $92.98. >“CoreWeave’s deep AI factory expertise, platform software, and unmatched execution velocity are recognized across the industry,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Together, we’re racing to meet extraordinary demand for NVIDIA AI factories—the foundation of the AI industrial revolution.” >Nvidia’s investment will help CoreWeave accelerate its buildout of “5 gigawatts of AI factories by 2030,” the companies said. >A gigawatt is a measure of power that’s becoming an increasingly common metric for describing AI data center capacity. Five gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 4 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration. >CoreWeave primarily generates revenue by building and renting out data centers that are full of Nvidia’s graphics processing units, which are key for training models and running large AI workloads. The company, which some investors have classified as a “neocloud,” has become a crucial player in an increasingly interconnected web of AI infrastructure partners. >Nvidia is already a major CoreWeave backer. >In September, CoreWeave disclosed an order worth at least $6.3 billion from Nvidia in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Nvidia has an obligation to buy the “residual unsold capacity through April 2032, according to the agreement. >CoreWeave went public on the Nasdaq in March, and the company raised billions of dollars in debt and equity, including from Nvidia. >As AI startups race to build out their computing infrastructure, CoreWeave has been on a deal-making blitz. The company announced in September that it agreed to provide Meta with $14.2 billion of AI cloud infrastructure, just days after expanding its contract with OpenAI to $22.4 billion.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Shares of CoreWeave popped 8 % in premarket trading on Monday after Nvidia announced it has invested $ 2 billion in the artificial intelligence infrastructure provider . Nvidia purchased CoreWeave Class A common stock at $ 87.20 per share according to a release . The share price is a discount from Friday ’ s closing price of $ 92.98 . “ CoreWeave ’ s deep AI factory expertise platform software and unmatched execution velocity are recognized across the industry ” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement . “ Together we ’ re racing to meet extraordinary demand for NVIDIA AI factories—the foundation of the AI industrial revolution. ” Nvidia ’ s investment will help CoreWeave accelerate its buildout of “ 5 gigawatts of AI factories by 2030 ” the companies said . A gigawatt is a measure of power that ’ s becoming an increasingly common metric for describing AI data center capacity . Five gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 4 million U.S. households according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration . CoreWeave primarily generates revenue by building and renting out data centers that are full of Nvidia ’ s graphics processing units which are key for training models and running large AI workloads . The company which some investors have classified as a “ neocloud ” has become a crucial player in an increasingly interconnected web of AI infrastructure partners . Nvidia is already a major CoreWeave backer . In September CoreWeave disclosed an order worth at least $ 6.3 billion from Nvidia in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . Nvidia has an obligation to buy the “ residual unsold capacity through April 2032 according to the agreement . CoreWeave went public on the Nasdaq in March and the company raised billions of dollars in debt and equity including from Nvidia . As AI startups race to build out their computing infrastructure CoreWeave has been on a dealmaking blitz . The company announced in September that it agreed to provide Meta with $ 14.2 billion of AI cloud infrastructure just days after expanding its contract with OpenAI to $ 22.4 billion ."

      "selftext": "You might ask yourselves, with all the selling happening in the markets, why does Gold continue to go up? It seems like right now, Gold and other precious metals are acting as safe haven investments amidst the economic chaos, On top of that, the narrative of countries buying Gold as reserves instead of dollars is putting extra pressure on the dollar. At some point, a weakening dollar tends to push people into risk assets, If wealthy investors continue buying Gold heavily, it could signal a shift in sentiment, Could this pattern spill over into crypto pumping too, taking profits, and pumping again? Gold already gained over 50% in 2025, and 2026 hasn’t slowed it down, Could the current environment actually be setting up a favorable stage for crypto to rally next? What do you all think, are we about to see a similar safe-to-risk rotation into crypto?",

      "title": "$8.69M UGL/GDXU YOLO in Advance of Strengthening Asian Currencies",
      "selftext": "I had wanted to post this play on Friday evening but preparations for the looming snowstorms delayed things a bit. This past week, we witnessed a precipitous decline in the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies like the euro, Swiss franc, and British pound. Movement that might normally be attributed to recent geopolitical concerns was driven, in part, by another factor. That is, on Friday, the Bank of Japan reached out to the U.S. Treasury Department to ask the U.S. Federal Reserve for a rate check. Murmurs about this rate check trickled out from various currency dealers just before lunchtime on the East Coast in the U.S. It was a widely known secret about an hour afterwards, which led to further downward pressure on the yen that also carried over to the U.S. dollar. I believe that most of the dealers were authorized to publicly comment on the request after the closing bell in New York. For those of you who do not dabble in currencies, rate checks are one way for central banks to strengthen their own currencies. Doing so avoids the hassle of directly raising rates and the negative effects those rate changes can have on domestic growth. Despite the Japanese Ministry of Finance's unprecedented rate increases this year, the yen has been somewhat sluggish to gain favor against other currencies. Japan has fiscal and political concerns that are depressing the yen. Both the Korean won and Taiwanese dollar are similarly weak. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent commented on this currency weakness about a few days ago and presumably again at sidebars at the World Economic Forum meeting. He has probably already started coordinating a strengthening of those currencies against the dollar. Due to these factors, we will see one of two outcomes that play out very soon. If the Japanese Ministry of Finance does not respond promptly, then there will likely be a short squeeze of the yen-dollar currency pair and a further debasement of the yen. If the Japanese Ministry of Finance acts, then it will do so by either raising rates further or offloading U.S. dollars for yen. Swapping currencies was the preferred approach by the two previous Japanese administrations and may be adopted by the current one. Either of these outcomes will undoubtedly lead to further declines of the dollar relative to the yen and other currencies. Rate increases would likely have the longest-lasting impact on depressing the dollar. Yen-denominated bonds would start to look even more attractive compared to dollar-based treasuries while coming with significantly fewer political concerns. This could lead to an outflow of dollars in favor of the yen. Alternatively, a sharp yen rally absent a rate hike would likely cause another violent drop of the U.S. dollar. This would be coupled with the potential for a slow dollar recovery rally against the yen a few weeks later, though. This knowledge leads to a few YOLO plays especially if no actions are taken by Japan during overnight hours on Sunday and pre-market hours on Monday. My preferred play is to continue to trade a market with which I am familiar, which is commodities. In particular, I am banking on the fact that a continuously declining dollar, caused in the short term by the forced strengthening of certain Asian currencies, will act as a short-term and medium-term backstop against any large pullbacks in precious metals like gold. If anything, it may allow for continued upwards movement in spot gold prices going into earnings season for gold and silver miners. That, in turn, could raise forward guidance for miners and lead to a few surprise gains for the biggest entities. My plan is to continue to hold approximately $6.61M in UGL (90000 shares) and $2.08M in GDXU (4500 shares) for a bit longer than I had planned. I have entered into and exited from these positions a few times over an extended period and typically held them for about two to three months each stretch. I was able to ride the rallies from near their beginnings and skip the dips at the expense of a huge tax bill. I most recently re-entered into these positions at the beginning of the new year and accelerated purchasing two weeks ago. I will be paring those positions and rotating most of the principal back into their non-leveraged versions and various, non-leveraged equities once I hit certain targets. Also, since I will likely get asked about this, I prefer to hold leveraged ETF/ETN shares versus LEAPS contracts for large positions like these that are highly speculative. Holding shares allows me to buy and sell during pre-market hours and thus start trimming to lock in gains when there is a wave of negative sentiment forming. This has been useful several times. In December, I was able to dodge a 10% overall decline in UGL and a 25% decline on GDXU, which was spurred by CME's margin capital increase, by selling right at pre-market open. My draw down was only in the 2-4% range for both positions. Similarly, in October, I was able to walk away with only a 3-6% decline in both positions versus an approximately 10-15% total decrease had I been forced to wait until market open.",

      "selftext_processed": "I had wanted to post this play on Friday evening but preparations for the looming snowstorms delayed things a bit . This past week we witnessed a precipitous decline in the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies like the euro Swiss franc and British pound . Movement that might normally be attributed to recent geopolitical concerns was driven in part by another factor . That is on Friday the Bank of Japan reached out to the U.S. Treasury Department to ask the U.S. Federal Reserve for a rate check . Murmurs about this rate check trickled out from various currency dealers just before lunchtime on the East Coast in the U.S . It was a widely known secret about an hour afterwards which led to further downward pressure on the yen that also carried over to the U.S. dollar . I believe that most of the dealers were authorized to publicly comment on the request after the closing bell in New York . For those of you who do not_dabble in currencies rate checks are one way for central banks to strengthen their own currencies . Doing so avoids the hassle of directly raising rates and the negative effects those rate changes can have on domestic growth . Despite the Japanese Ministry of Finances unprecedented rate increases this year the yen has been somewhat sluggish to gain favor against other currencies . Japan has fiscal and political concerns that are depressing the yen . Both the Korean won and Taiwanese dollar are similarly weak . U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent commented on this currency weakness about a few days ago and presumably again at sidebars at the World Economic Forum meeting . He has probably already started coordinating a strengthening of those currencies against the dollar . Due to these factors we will see one of two outcomes that play out very soon . If the Japanese Ministry of Finance does not_respond promptly then there will likely be a short squeeze of the yendollar currency pair and a further debasement of the yen . If the Japanese Ministry of Finance acts then it will do so by either raising rates further or offloading U.S. dollars for yen . Swapping currencies was the preferred approach by the two previous Japanese administrations and may be adopted by the current one . Either of these outcomes will undoubtedly lead to further declines of the dollar relative to the yen and other currencies . Rate increases would likely have the longestlasting impact on depressing the dollar . Yendenominated bonds would start to look even more attractive compared to dollarbased treasuries while coming with significantly fewer political concerns . This could lead to an outflow of dollars in favor of the yen . Alternatively a sharp yen rally absent a rate hike would likely cause another violent drop of the U.S. dollar . This would be coupled with the potential for a slow dollar recovery rally against the yen a few weeks later though . This knowledge leads to a few YOLO plays especially if no_actions are taken by Japan during overnight hours on Sunday and premarket hours on Monday . My preferred play is to continue to trade a market with which I am familiar which is commodities . In particular I am banking on the fact that a continuously declining dollar caused in the short term by the forced strengthening of certain Asian currencies will act as a shortterm and mediumterm backstop against any large pullbacks in precious metals like gold . If anything it may allow for continued upwards movement in spot gold prices going into earnings season for gold and silver miners . That in turn could raise forward guidance for miners and lead to a few surprise gains for the biggest entities . My plan is to continue to hold approximately $ 6.61M in UGL 90000 shares and $ 2.08M in GDXU 4500 shares for a bit longer than I had planned . I have entered into and exited from these positions a few times over an extended period and typically held them for about two to three months each stretch . I was able to ride the rallies from near their beginnings and skip the dips at the expense of a huge tax bill . I most recently reentered into these positions at the beginning of the new year and accelerated purchasing two weeks ago . I will be paring those positions and rotating most of the principal back into their nonleveraged versions and various nonleveraged equities once I hit certain targets . Also since I will likely get asked about this I prefer to hold leveraged ETFETN shares versus LEAPS contracts for large positions like these that are highly speculative . Holding shares allows me to buy and sell during premarket hours and thus start trimming to lock in gains when there is a wave of negative sentiment forming . This has been useful several times . In December I was able to dodge a 10 % overall decline in UGL and a 25 % decline on GDXU which was spurred by CMEs margin capital increase by selling right at premarket open . My draw down was only in the 24 % range for both positions . Similarly in October I was able to walk away with only a 36 % decline in both positions versus an approximately 1015 % total decrease had I been forced to wait until market open ."

It’s under-owned relative to its importance and increasingly looks like a value metal within hard assets. Copper is the backbone of reindustrialization. AI data centers, power grids, defense, EVs, electrification, and energy infrastructure all require large and rising amounts of copper. Nearly every credible growth or tech narrative implicitly assumes more copper consumption. Supply is structurally constrained. Global copper demand already exceeds supply, ore grades are declining, and new mines take decades to permit and develop. There is no fast supply response. If capital rotates from pure monetary hedges into real-economy scarcity, copper has asymmetric upside. any thoughts on this?",

AI data centers power grids defense EVs electrification and energy infrastructure all require large and rising amounts of copper . Nearly every credible growth or tech narrative implicitly assumes more copper consumption . Supply is structurally constrained . Global copper demand already exceeds supply ore grades are declining and new mines take decades to permit and develop . There is no_fast supply response .

Interest is high but we dont pay a dime. $50,000 - We have saved up $50,000 and are considering joining a golf club or a country club in our area. There are a few to choose from and range from buy ins from $30,000-$50,000. Dues range from $700-$1200 which we can easily afford and we save around $2000 extra each month after we fund retirement. If we did join a club our retirement savings would go to %10 of our income but have the pensions etc. At what point did you decide to live a little vs keep grinding and saving? We have done really well for our ages and the amount of money we make. We still go on vacations and do what we want when we want so we dont feel like we have missed out. Def could stock it away and keep pushing the needle but wondering when is enough.....enough? Anyone who has decided to splurge in life is there any indicator on when the time is right? We do have two kids but college is paid for",

      "title": "Impinj DD - RAIN RFID for consumers?",
      "selftext": "My position details: I own 1,982 shares of Impinj (PI) stock. PI market cap: $4.8B Impinj manufactures UHF (RAIN) RFID tag integrated circuits (ICs). They sell more than about 15 billion per year. Impinj might sell a tag IC for $0.005-$0.02. Impinj sells the tag ICs to inlay manufacturers like Avery Denison and others. Inlay manufacturers sell inlays (tag IC + antenna + substrate) to end customers to attach to their products. Tags can be little stickers, adhered to paper clothing tags, sewed nearly invisibly into clothing, hidden inside anything non-metallic or non-liquid, etc. Impinj also manufactures expensive stand-alone RFID readers, but also sells the reader IC used by several other companies who then sell their cheaper readers to end customers. I don't have much to say about their readers. Impinj competes with NXP in tag ICs/chips. Impinj won lawsuit against NXP in 2024 and receives license fee yearly. Part of settlement beyond the yearly cash is a 10-year agreement to not sue over patents, which is a huge relief for Impinj through 2034. David defeated Goliath once and Impinj has 8 more years before any possible rematches. For the next 8 years, Impinj has freedom to grow aggressively without fear of immediate retaliatory litigation from NXP. RAIN RFID is currently used in places like: Walmart, Inditex (clothing), UPS (package tracking, package-on-right-truck verification), Delta and United (baggage tracking), medicine tracking, car tires and other parts, etc. Supply chains and clothing, primarily. Recent investor calls show they're starting to push food with Kroger. Food opportunity for Impinj and tagging is obviously very large compared to their current markets, which may explain their current valuation, which is arguably high. They're starting in the bakery sections now. Engineering deets you can skip if you're not technical: Tag ICs have been improving in performance, usually about 1-2dB (RF link budget spec for tag sensitivity) per generation / node shrink. This has been essential to the technology's capability and expanded usage. I asked Gemini about next node and it's guessing 20-something nm will be the final node and its reasons are sound, which means tag chip analog performance improvement is nearing its end and the analog circuitry will not get smaller. Impinj knows this. Digital performance/capability/featureset may yet still improve with even smaller nodes. Impinj has been focusing on broadening featureset like cryptography and gen2x and is clearly leading and driving its technology. Also, smaller node = more tag ICs per wafer = cheaper tag ICs, so Impinj still certainly has one more significant margin increase ahead. 20-something nm nodes are well matured at this point and should not have a premium. Impinj requires cheap wafers. Impinj likes to talk about the European DPP initiative in their investor calls (do your own reading on this). I know Trump is fucking over US-EU relations and is causing EU re-evaluation of large initiatives and regulations, so I have my doubts about DPP ever using RAIN RFID at all, even as a option/backup. HOWEVER, Impinj clearly sees it as a backdoor into the real endgame: retail consumers. Right now, RAIN RFID tags are always killed at checkout. The EU DPP would expand RAIN RFID adoption obviously, but more importantly would necessarily keep tags alive after item purchase. Consumer use is the reason for Impinj's new \"Protected Mode\". Tags with Protected mode look dead and only wake up if given the right PIN. Retailer controls PIN and can transfer PIN to consumer via smartphone, or Kroger could set PIN(s) for all its products and allow consumers to query their groceries' tags at home for pantry inventory, etc. You get the idea. There's also insights into Impinj's thoughts from press releases on Gen2x, which extends the protocol the tag ICs use: \"It \\[Gen2x\\] addresses consumer privacy at point-of-sale.. \\[...\\] We are today focused on enterprise use cases, but tomorrow’s emphasis will be on consumer use cases, including consumer safety and item sustainability.\" \"Inhibits tag and item counterfeiting, fraudulent returns, or both.\" \"Impinj Protected Mode tag data protection Makes a RAIN tag invisible to RAIN readers. When necessary, the tag can be returned to normal operation using a secure PIN.\" \"Impinj Authenticity cryptographic authentication Verifies a product’s authenticity using a challenge-response protocol, preventing counterfeits and securing the supply chain.\" I suspect that authentication requires a centralized database to verify that the tag chip itself is authentic. Impinj must control that. I doubt that Impinj will control the item info itself ('this is a Nike Air shoe, number 123456' for example) but will control authentication and will certainly charge a fee per scan for authentication ('Impinj indeed made this tag IC, it matches code xyzpdq in our authentication database'). So Impinj won't know what the product is (only the brands will, like Walmart or Nike), but Impinj uniquely will be involved in \\*every tag scan for authentication\\*. Impinj will not make ad revenue on item data itself - only end-users like Nike or Kroger would. However, Impinj will certainly charge for authentication events like store purchases/returns. Imagine getting an additional few cents return per tag IC via the authentication service. Impinj is clearly trying to get into consumer phones. Qualcomm Q-6690 - UHF (RAIN) RFID integrated into mobile processor for the first time. Commercial/industrial device focus only. It's a relatively easy jump to consumer smartphones from here now that a UHF/RAIN RFID radio has been integrated into an IC. That will unlock tons more potential. Smartphone manufactueres may be excited about finally introducing a significant new feature. I see this playing out like so: 1. Consumer enables RFID reading on their household grocery items via Kroger (or their clothing items via Kohls or whoever) 2. For the first time, companies get information on where items go once they leave the stores and how long they stay there. 3. Companies know what food is in someone's house and how long it's been there. 4. Companies know what clothing is in someone's house and how long it's been there. 5. Fundamentally, Companies know identifying information of any UHF (RAIN) RFID tagged item in anyone's house (if the tag IC is alive and enabled), as long as consumers have a phone that can read them AND as long as consumers allow the tags to be read again with the PIN from the store they bought their stuff from. 6. Advertiser potential galore for whoever has this information. Impinj won't make money off this directly, but this'll push more tags to be in more things. 7. Companies will want to tag fucking everything, so Impinj sells 100s of billions of tags per year instead of 15 billion. I'd say >20x growth potential, reasonably, not including the value of authentication services which is fuzzy to me. Wiliot has been brought up as an existential threat to RAIN RFID because it uses Bluetooth (which everyone already has) but I don't see it. Inlays are 2-5x as expensive, read rate is 100x to >1000x slower, tag beacons its info out randomly instead of upon query by a reader/interrogator, tag beaconing interval depends on ambient energy levels which vary everywhere. I'd forget about it. I think Impinj needs to hit +20% yearly growth by gaining enterprise customers to meet investor expectations and today's valuation. Hitting those high targets will reward Impinj with consistent $200+/share. Consumer market is the moonshot / gamble for long term holders. Authentication, to me, is a positive thing of unknown magnitude/effect, though it'd definitely improve margins. Risks: \\-Trump's continued antagonizing of Europe (and the world) may harm/kill RAIN RFID consumer adoption via DPP as EU countries reprioritize and/or may create preference for NXP within the EU. Reducing global cooperation is bad for global standards for RAIN RFID. \\-Stock is unusually volatile despite being recently added to S&P smallcap 600. Seems to have a strong yearly cycle based on retail/holiday cycle. Many sudden ups/downs based on enterprise performance and news and whether investors believe in the company's growth as a result. Be patient and only buy in low if you buy in. \\-The timeline to break into the consumer space, if it ever does, may still be long. Obstacles: \\-Tagging metal surfaces (like canned goods or foil-lined bags) can be done and the physics has been solved, but crucially it remains expensive at >$0.60 per tag. A normal RAIN RFID tag (tag IC + inlay) might be $0.035-$0.05. A cost breakthrough for metal surfaces would be big news. Until then, this fundamentally limits RAIN RFID in grocery and remains a barrier for the technology. \\-Breaking into consumer (normal person) smartphones for the high growth trajectory. Impinj is making all the right moves so far, but it's a barrier that hasn't been broken yet. Bulls: \\-If you hear about major new enterprise customers, that's bullish. Imipnj can dream about getting Amazon. \\-If you hear about the launch of an Impinj authentication service, that's bullish. \\-If you hear that RAIN RFID tags for metal surfaces have a cost breakthrough, that's very bullish. \\-If the EU \\*mandates\\* RAIN RFID for DPP, that's very bullish (whereas if RAIN RFID is just an option, that's somewhat bullish). \\-If any major smartphone manufacturer announces UHF (RAIN) RFID capability built into consumer phones, that's extremely bullish. Bears: \\-If Impinj fails to secure new large enterprise accounts, that's bearish. \\-If Impinj's only growth over the next two years is through increasing its market share (like vs NXP) rather than new market growth, that's very bearish. Recommendation: Diversify your portfolio with Impinj if it dips below \\~$110. Buy a large amount if it ever dips below $70 (like last April) because I'd peg Impinj at roughly $50-$60 without its growth premium at all. Sit on it for 3 years and then re-evaluate.",

      "selftext_processed": "My position details I own 1982 shares of Impinj PI stock . PI market cap $ 4.8B Impinj manufactures UHF RAIN RFID tag integrated circuits ICs . They sell more than about 15 billion per year . Impinj might sell a tag IC for $ 0.005 $ 0.02 . Impinj sells the tag ICs to inlay manufacturers like Avery Denison and others . Inlay manufacturers sell inlays tag IC antenna substrate to end customers to attach to their products . Tags can be little stickers adhered to paper clothing tags sewed nearly invisibly into clothing hidden inside anything nonmetallic or nonliquid etc . Impinj also manufactures expensive standalone RFID readers but also sells the reader IC used by several other companies who then sell their cheaper readers to end customers . I dont have much to say about their readers . Impinj competes with NXP in tag ICschips . Impinj won lawsuit against NXP in 2024 and receives license fee yearly . Part of settlement beyond the yearly cash is a 10year agreement to not_sue over patents which is a huge relief for Impinj through 2034 . David defeated Goliath once and Impinj has 8 more years before any possible rematches . For the next 8 years Impinj has freedom to grow aggressively without fear of immediate retaliatory litigation from NXP . RAIN RFID is currently used in places like Walmart Inditex clothing UPS package tracking packageonrighttruck verification Delta and United baggage tracking medicine tracking car tires and other parts etc . Supply chains and clothing primarily . Recent investor calls show theyre starting to push food with Kroger . Food opportunity for Impinj and tagging is obviously very large compared to their current markets which may explain their current valuation which is arguably high . Theyre starting in the bakery sections now . Engineering deets you can skip if youre not_technical Tag ICs have been improving in performance usually about 12dB RF link budget spec for tag sensitivity per generation node shrink . This has been essential to the technologys capability and expanded usage . I asked Gemini about next node and its guessing 20something nm will be the final node and its reasons are sound which means tag chip analog performance improvement is nearing its end and the analog circuitry will not_get smaller . Impinj knows this . Digital performancecapabilityfeatureset may yet still improve with even smaller nodes . Impinj has been focusing on broadening featureset like cryptography and gen2x and is clearly leading and driving its technology . Also smaller node more tag ICs per wafer cheaper tag ICs so Impinj still certainly has one more significant margin increase ahead . 20something nm nodes are well matured at this point and should not_have a premium . Impinj requires cheap wafers . Impinj likes to talk about the European DPP initiative in their investor calls do your own reading on this . I know Trump is fucking over USEU relations and is causing EU reevaluation of large initiatives and regulations so I have my doubts about DPP ever using RAIN RFID at all even as a optionbackup . HOWEVER Impinj clearly sees it as a backdoor into the real endgame retail consumers . Right now RAIN RFID tags are always killed at checkout . The EU DPP would expand RAIN RFID adoption obviously but more importantly would necessarily keep tags alive after item purchase . Consumer use is the reason for Impinjs new Protected Mode . Tags with Protected mode look dead and only wake up if given the right PIN . Retailer controls PIN and can transfer PIN to consumer via smartphone or Kroger could set PINs for all its products and allow consumers to query their groceries tags at home for pantry inventory etc . You get the idea . Theres also insights into Impinjs thoughts from press releases on Gen2x which extends the protocol the tag ICs use It Gen2x addresses consumer privacy at pointofsale .. ... We are today focused on enterprise use cases but tomorrow ’ s emphasis will be on consumer use cases including consumer safety and item sustainability . Inhibits tag and item counterfeiting fraudulent returns or both . Impinj Protected Mode tag data protection Makes a RAIN tag invisible to RAIN readers . When necessary the tag can be returned to normal operation using a secure PIN . Impinj Authenticity cryptographic authentication Verifies a product ’ s authenticity using a challengeresponse protocol preventing counterfeits and securing the supply chain . I suspect that authentication requires a centralized database to verify that the tag chip itself is authentic . Impinj must control that . I doubt that Impinj will control the item info itself this is a Nike Air shoe number 123456 for example but will control authentication and will certainly charge a fee per scan for authentication Impinj indeed made this tag IC it matches code xyzpdq in our authentication database . So Impinj wont know what the product is only the brands will like Walmart or Nike but Impinj uniquely will be involved in every tag scan for authentication . Impinj will not_make ad revenue on item data itself only endusers like Nike or Kroger would . However Impinj will certainly charge for authentication events like store purchasesreturns . Imagine getting an additional few cents return per tag IC via the authentication service . Impinj is clearly trying to get into consumer phones . Qualcomm Q6690 UHF RAIN RFID integrated into mobile processor for the first time . Commercialindustrial device focus only . Its a relatively easy jump to consumer smartphones from here now that a UHFRAIN RFID radio has been integrated into an IC . That will unlock tons more potential . Smartphone manufactueres may be excited about finally introducing a significant new feature . I see this playing out like so 1 . Consumer enables RFID reading on their household grocery items via Kroger or their clothing items via Kohls or whoever 2 . For the first time companies get information on where items go once they leave the stores and how long they stay there . 3 . Companies know what food is in someones house and how long its been there . 4 . Companies know what clothing is in someones house and how long its been there . 5 . Fundamentally Companies know identifying information of any UHF RAIN RFID tagged item in anyones house if the tag IC is alive and enabled as long as consumers have a phone that can read them AND as long as consumers allow the tags to be read again with the PIN from the store they bought their stuff from . 6 . Advertiser potential galore for whoever has this information . Impinj wont make money off this directly but thisll push more tags to be in more things . 7 . Companies will want to tag fucking everything so Impinj sells 100s of billions of tags per year instead of 15 billion . Id say 20x growth potential reasonably not_including the value of authentication services which is fuzzy to me . Wiliot has been brought up as an existential threat to RAIN RFID because it uses Bluetooth which everyone already has but I dont see it . Inlays are 25x as expensive read rate is 100x to 1000x slower tag beacons its info out randomly instead of upon query by a readerinterrogator tag beaconing interval depends on ambient energy levels which vary everywhere . Id forget about it . I think Impinj needs to hit 20 % yearly growth by gaining enterprise customers to meet investor expectations and todays valuation . Hitting those high targets will reward Impinj with consistent $ 200share . Consumer market is the moonshot gamble for long term holders . Authentication to me is a positive thing of unknown magnitudeeffect though itd definitely improve margins . Risks Trumps continued antagonizing of Europe and the world may harmkill RAIN RFID consumer adoption via DPP as EU countries reprioritize andor may create preference for NXP within the EU . Reducing global cooperation is bad for global standards for RAIN RFID . Stock is unusually volatile despite being recently added to SP smallcap 600 . Seems to have a strong yearly cycle based on retailholiday cycle . Many sudden upsdowns based on enterprise performance and news and whether investors believe in the companys growth as a result . Be patient and only buy in low if you buy in . The timeline to break into the consumer space if it ever does may still be long . Obstacles Tagging metal surfaces like canned goods or foillined bags can be done and the physics has been solved but crucially it remains expensive at $ 0.60 per tag . A normal RAIN RFID tag tag IC inlay might be $ 0.035 $ 0.05 . A cost breakthrough for metal surfaces would be big news . Until then this fundamentally limits RAIN RFID in grocery and remains a barrier for the technology . Breaking into consumer normal person smartphones for the high growth trajectory . Impinj is making all the right moves so far but its a barrier that hasnt been broken yet . Bulls If you hear about major new enterprise customers thats bullish . Imipnj can dream about getting Amazon . If you hear about the launch of an Impinj authentication service thats bullish . If you hear that RAIN RFID tags for metal surfaces have a cost breakthrough thats very bullish . If the EU mandates RAIN RFID for DPP thats very bullish whereas if RAIN RFID is just an option thats somewhat bullish . If any major smartphone manufacturer announces UHF RAIN RFID capability built into consumer phones thats extremely bullish . Bears If Impinj fails to secure new large enterprise accounts thats bearish . If Impinjs only growth over the next two years is through increasing its market share like vs NXP rather than new market growth thats very bearish . Recommendation Diversify your portfolio with Impinj if it dips below $ 110 . Buy a large amount if it ever dips below $ 70 like last April because Id peg Impinj at roughly $ 50 $ 60 without its growth premium at all . Sit on it for 3 years and then reevaluate ."

      "selftext": "This is my hypothesis only. Would like if somebody confirms this. So Tesla regardless of being valued at 50-60 billion dollars back until 2018 wasn't part of SP500 since it hadn't posted 4 quarters of profits. Ocassional quarter profits, but no consequetive profits. That changed in 2019, when the company posted 4 consequetive years worth of profit. After successful profit years, even if minimal, Money Managers at Wall Street took a note and started aggressively buying to push the stock up. So much so, that even before the inclusion of stock in index, it was at 400 billion dollars worth of market cap. And passive indexes were forced to buy in the stock at rebalancing. Hence locking the value. I don't have data to back the initial rally between end of 4th quarter profit and date of sp500 inclusion. And this where I'm guessing. Perhaps y'all could correct me or show some data if that's actually true.",

For some reason, purely on feeling, I wanted to buy out-of-the-money SPY calls and put my entire non-registered account into that trade. The contracts were trading at $0.05 each. I was honestly confident. But I didn’t pull the trigger because I didn’t want to sell my S&P 500 shares and deal with taxes. So I stayed disciplined and did nothing. Two hours later, Trump announces he found an arrangement with Greenland. SPY pumps 1.2% almost instantly. Those same calls go from $0.05 to $2.65. That’s a 53x move. About a 5,200% gain. If I had gone all in like my instinct told me, it would’ve been life-changing money. Instead, I watched it happen from the sidelines. Now every day when I go to work, I think about it. I replay it in my head. “What if I just clicked buy.” It’s brutal. I know logically this is just part of trading and you can’t catch everything, but emotionally it feels different when it’s that big. How do you actually move on from missing something like this? How do you stop letting a single trade live rent-free in your head? Would really appreciate advice from people who’ve been through similar situations.",

For some reason purely on feeling I wanted to buy outofthemoney SPY calls and put my entire nonregistered account into that trade . The contracts were trading at $ 0.05 each . I was honestly confident . But I didn ’ t pull the trigger because I didn ’ t want to sell my SP 500 shares and deal with taxes . So I stayed disciplined and did nothing_Two hours later Trump announces he found an arrangement with Greenland . SPY pumps 1.2 % almost instantly . Those same calls go from $ 0.05 to $ 2.65 . That ’ s a 53x move . About a 5200 % gain . If I had gone all in like my instinct told me it would ’ ve been lifechanging money . Instead I watched it happen from the sidelines . Now every day when I go to work I think about it . I replay it in my head . “ What if I just clicked buy. ” It ’ s brutal . I know logically this is just part of trading and you can ’ t catch everything but emotionally it feels different when it ’ s that big . How do you actually move on from missing something like this How do you stop letting a single trade live rentfree in your head Would really appreciate advice from people who ’ ve been through similar situations ."

(NASDAQ: TALK) is a virtual behavioral health company that connects users with licensed therapists and psychiatrists through its digital platform, offering text, audio, and video sessions. The company has successfully pivoted from a direct-to-consumer model to a payer-centric strategy, which has significantly driven its recent growth. Talkspace reported Q3 2025 revenue of $59.4 million, up 25% year-over-year, with payer revenue growing 42%. The company has achieved profitability, posting positive EPS of $0.03 over the last twelve months and EBITDA of $3.35 million. Management narrowed full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $226–$230 million, implying 20–23% year-over-year growth, and expects at least 20% growth to continue into 2026. Strengthening payer relationships have been key to this momentum, with active payer members increasing 29% year-over-year to over 120,000 in Q3 2025. Talkspace is expanding through additional payer integrations expected by Q1 2026 and renewed its Sourcewell cooperative purchasing contract to serve government agencies, educational institutions, and nonprofits across North America. Analyst sentiment remains highly positive, with Buy ratings from Canaccord Genuity ($6 price target), Needham ($5), and KeyBanc ($5), representing meaningful upside from current levels. Investments in AI, including proprietary risk algorithms and plans for an in-house AI chatbot in 2026, position Talkspace well for continued innovation in the digital mental health space. Risks include high valuation multiples, competitive pressures, and gross margin compression from increased payer mix. Despite this, strong cash reserves, sustained revenue growth, and a strategic focus on payer relationships support a favorable long-term outlook.",

      "title": "Memory Super-Cyle, $MU",
      "selftext": "Hello there, I’m sure many are aware of a memory super-cycle taking place. What I’m not seeing is a lot of retail sentiment toward these tickers yet. I know there has been a lot of fear, and I know there has been a lot of concern of the cyclical nature of memory stocks. However, most experts are expecting the memory shortage to last until at least 2028. I’m going to focus on High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) since storage has gotten a lot of love on the retail side. The three largest HBM manufacturers around the world Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix have all sold out of their 2026 supply for HBM4. Sandisk, Western Digital, and Seagate are all worth mentioning since they are part of storage memory. They are worth taking the time for DD. However, I feel they have gotten more retail love than HBM so far. Micron is the only manufacturer in the big three for HBM on the NYSE. You may recognize their consumer RAM they just slashed to shift toward demand, crucial. They are currently developing four fabrication labs in NY, they have two in their home state of Idaho, One in Virginia. They recently acquired a PSMC in Taiwan. Basically, they are leveraging their growth for a boost in demand in regard to AI. The thing is, all of this won’t start to make a dent in demand until the end of 2027 At the earliest. So far we have been living in a world that questions if AI is a bubble. I’ve come to the conclusion for myself that even if AI does have a pullback, we’ve already opened Pandora’s box. If our markets have been only led by a group by AI skeptics & believers. Wait until the bubble fears subside and everyone else realizes it’s not going anywhere. People thought the dead internet theory would hurt AI, but guess what? Your aunties and cousins all love AI. No matter what they slop is they still consume. That’s just on the reels side of things. When agenetic AI and other technologies like Boston Dyanmics improve it will be off to the races. The reason I’m explaining all of this is to explain the HBM shortage bear case is only until 2027. This shortage could potentially lead into the 2030’s. For the consumers sake, I hope not. But it’s a realistic scenario we face. Back to Micron. There is bullish cause to believe they may reach a trillion dollar market cap by the end of the year. There was sentiment of years prior that they were held price in price. The spring they experienced last year may just have been escaping manipulation. “Although it just hit new all time highs of $399, Micron trades at a forward P/E of roughly 10–12. This is a significant discount compared to AI leaders like NVIDIA (24x) or AMD (35x). This momentum is expected to accelerate, with analysts projecting full-year fiscal 2026 revenue to potentially reach $75.6 billion, a 102% increase over 2025.” To me if we get tailwind that this shortage is lasting past 2028. That would make today’s mark look like a steep discount. I see them having steady growth through the entire year. As for price action, they’ve been steady as well. Pretty normal pullback right after all time highs but quick recovery. Just want you all to be aware, I’m holding about 140 MU & 130 WDC. So I’m very bullish on memory. However for MU I didn’t enter until the 330 range. Which a Micron insider also did with 7.8 million dollars just this month. So if an insider is that bullish, I would also say that keeps me polishing my diamond hands in the meantime while I get tendy grease all over them. What are your alls thoughts on the super cycle?",

I know there has been a lot of fear, and I know there has been a lot of concern of the cyclical nature of memory stocks. However, most experts are expecting the memory shortage to last until at least 2028. I’m going to focus on High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) since storage has gotten a lot of love on the retail side. The three largest HBM manufacturers around the world Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix have all sold out of their 2026 supply for HBM4. Sandisk, Western Digital, and Seagate are all worth mentioning since they are part of storage memory. They are worth taking the time for DD. However, I feel they have gotten more retail love than HBM so far. Micron is the only manufacturer in the big three for HBM on the NYSE. You may recognize their consumer RAM they just slashed to shift toward demand, crucial. They are currently developing four fabrication labs in NY, they have two in their home state of Idaho, One in Virginia. They recently acquired a PSMC in Taiwan. Basically, they are leveraging their growth for a boost in demand in regard to AI. The thing is, all of this won’t start to make a dent in demand until the end of 2027 At the earliest. So far we have been living in a world that questions if AI is a bubble. I’ve come to the conclusion for myself that even if AI does have a pullback, we’ve already opened Pandora’s box. If our markets have been only led by a group by AI skeptics & believers. Wait until the bubble fears subside and everyone else realizes it’s not going anywhere. People thought the dead internet theory would hurt AI, but guess what? Your aunties and cousins all love AI. No matter what they slop is they still consume. That’s just on the reels side of things. When agenetic AI and other technologies like Boston Dyanmics improve it will be off to the races. The reason I’m explaining all of this is to explain the HBM shortage bear case is only until 2027. This shortage could potentially lead into the 2030’s. For the consumers sake, I hope not. But it’s a realistic scenario we face. Back to Micron. There is bullish cause to believe they may reach a trillion dollar market cap by the end of the year. There was sentiment of years prior that they were held price in price. The spring they experienced last year may just have been escaping manipulation. “Although it just hit new all time highs of $399, Micron trades at a forward P/E of roughly 10–12. This is a significant discount compared to AI leaders like NVIDIA (24x) or AMD (35x). This momentum is expected to accelerate, with analysts projecting full-year fiscal 2026 revenue to potentially reach $75.6 billion, a 102% increase over 2025.” To me if we get tailwind that this shortage is lasting past 2028. That would make today’s mark look like a steep discount. I see them having steady growth through the entire year. As for price action, they’ve been steady as well. Pretty normal pullback right after all time highs but quick recovery. Just want you all to be aware, I’m holding about 140 MU & 130 WDC. So I’m very bullish on memory.

      "selftext_processed": "Hello there I ’ m sure many are aware of a memory supercycle taking place . What I ’ m not_seeing is a lot of retail sentiment toward these tickers yet . I know there has been a lot of fear and I know there has been a lot of concern of the cyclical nature of memory stocks . However most experts are expecting the memory shortage to last until at least 2028 . I ’ m going to focus on High Bandwidth Memory HBM since storage has gotten a lot of love on the retail side . The three largest HBM manufacturers around the world Micron Samsung and SK Hynix have all sold out of their 2026 supply for HBM4 . Sandisk Western Digital and Seagate are all worth mentioning since they are part of storage memory . They are worth taking the time for DD . However I feel they have gotten more retail love than HBM so far . Micron is the only manufacturer in the big three for HBM on the NYSE . You may recognize their consumer RAM they just slashed to shift toward demand crucial . They are currently developing four fabrication labs in NY they have two in their home state of Idaho One in Virginia . They recently acquired a PSMC in Taiwan . Basically they are leveraging their growth for a boost in demand in regard to AI . The thing is all of this won ’ t start to make a dent in demand until the end of 2027 At the earliest . So far we have been living in a world that questions if AI is a bubble . I ’ ve come to the conclusion for myself that even if AI does have a pullback we ’ ve already opened Pandora ’ s box . If our markets have been only led by a group by AI skeptics believers . Wait until the bubble fears subside and everyone else realizes it ’ s not_going anywhere . People thought the dead internet theory would hurt AI but guess what Your aunties and cousins all love AI . No_matter what they slop is they still consume . That ’ s just on the reels side of things . When agenetic AI and other technologies like Boston Dyanmics improve it will be off to the races . The reason I ’ m explaining all of this is to explain the HBM shortage bear case is only until 2027 . This shortage could potentially lead into the 2030 ’ s . For the consumers sake I hope not_But it ’ s a realistic scenario we face . Back to Micron . There is bullish cause to believe they may reach a trillion dollar market cap by the end of the year . There was sentiment of years prior that they were held price in price . The spring they experienced last year may just have been escaping manipulation . “ Although it just hit new all time highs of $ 399 Micron trades at a forward PE of roughly 10–12 . This is a significant discount compared to AI leaders like NVIDIA 24x or AMD 35x . This momentum is expected to accelerate with analysts projecting fullyear fiscal 2026 revenue to potentially reach $ 75.6 billion a 102 % increase over 2025. ” To me if we get tailwind that this shortage is lasting past 2028 . That would make today ’ s mark look like a steep discount . I see them having steady growth through the entire year . As for price action they ’ ve been steady as well . Pretty normal pullback right after all time highs but quick recovery . Just want you all to be aware I ’ m holding about 140 MU 130 WDC . So I ’ m very bullish on memory . However for MU I didn ’ t enter until the 330 range . Which a Micron insider also did with 7.8 million dollars just this month . So if an insider is that bullish I would also say that keeps me polishing my diamond hands in the meantime while I get tendy grease all over them . What are your alls thoughts on the super cycle"

      "selftext": "I’m looking for feedback on my overall financial and investment strategy, particularly around asset allocation and how I’m using my Solo 401(k). I’m 35, married, and expect to earn approximately **$492,000 pre-tax this year as a 1099 physician**. My long-term goal is early retirement around age 55, so I’m trying to balance growth, diversification, and tax efficiency while managing income volatility. My currently does not work and is in school full time, but will be looking for work in the coming months after graduation in May. **Accounts & current positioning:** **Roth IRA** **(backdoor):** * \\~$8,400 total * 50/50 split between **VTI / VXUS** * Haven’t made my 2026 contribution yet * Intended for long-term, tax-free growth **Solo 401(k) (traditional):** * \\~$16,000 invested, split **90/10 between VXUS / FTEC** * \\~$22,000 currently in cash * This account is where I’m considering a higher growth tilt **Cash / short-term holdings:** * \\~$76,000 in a HYSA earning \\~3.30% * \\~$459,000 in a CD earning \\~3.92%, maturing in the next few months and earmarked for a home down payment **Debt** * \\~$400,000 in student loans Because the CD funds are intended for a near-term home purchase, I’m treating them as non-investable capital and avoiding market risk with that money. **What I’m looking for feedback on:** * Whether my overall risk level and allocation make sense given my age, income, and early retirement timeline * Should my spouse open up a spousal Roth IRA, and would they need to do it via backdoor? * How aggressive it’s reasonable to be inside the Solo 401(k) relative to the Roth IRA * How others would think about deploying the remaining **$22K of cash in the Solo 401(k)** from an asset-allocation perspective (not specific recommendations, but frameworks) * Whether my current international and growth exposure is balanced or redundant * Any tax inefficiencies or structural blind spots I may be overlooking as a high-income 1099 earner **Notes:** * Really don't want to try to pay down student loans, but that might be a bad move * A house purchase is a must for us in the few months, so using the money in the CD to pay off student loans is a no-go * 1099s have a hard time getting approved for home loans I’m not looking for personalized financial advice, just general insights, critiques, or alternative ways to think about structuring this setup.",

      "selftext": "The Trump administration is planning to inject $1.6bn into an American rare earths company, its biggest investment in the sector, in Washington’s latest foray into private industry to shore up supplies of key minerals. The US government will receive a 10 per cent stake in USA Rare Earth, a publicly traded Oklahoma-based miner that controls significant US deposits of heavy rare earths, according to people familiar with the matter. The government investment and a separate $1bn private financing deal are expected to be announced on Monday, according to people familiar with the situation. One person said the government would get 16.1m shares in USA Rare Earth and warrants for another 17.6m, both at a price of $17.17. The government agreed to pay $277mn for the equity, giving it an implied gain of $490mn for the equity and warrants based on the current share price of $24.77. USA Rare Earth will also receive $1.3bn in senior secured debt financing at market rates from the government. The money will come from a finance facility created for the commerce department as part of the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022. A commerce official said the department completed the transaction directly with the company. Talks progressed rapidly this week as investor interest returned to critical mineral stocks after President Donald Trump said Washington had reached the “framework” for a deal that could include access to Greenland’s untapped critical mineral wealth. One person familiar with the situation noted that the USA Rare Earth deal was unrelated to Greenland. USA Rare Earth declined to comment. The commerce department declined to discuss the deal. But an official in the Chips office — a part of the commerce department housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology that led the negotiations — said it was “focused on onshoring critical and strategic mineral essential to the semiconductor supply chain and US national security”. USA Rare Earth has separately tapped Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street firm previously owned by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and now run by his sons, to raise more than $1bn in fresh equity financing, the people said. It is not directly related to the deal with the government. The deal marks the latest example of the Trump administration’s efforts to intervene in parts of the private sector viewed as critical to US national security, including taking a 10 per cent stake in chipmaker Intel and negotiating a so-called golden-share agreement in US Steel. USA Rare Earth, which has a market value of $3.7bn, is developing a huge mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas that it says contains 15 of the 17 rare earth elements underpinning production of cell phones, missiles and fighter jets. It also plans to open a magnet production facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Last year, the Trump administration invested in at least six minerals companies, including MP Materials, Trilogy Metals and Lithium Americas. Some of the investments overlapped with the financial interests of people associated with the administration. The government did a funding deal with Vulcan Elements, a rare earths start-up three months after the president’s son Donald Trump Jr’s venture capital group invested in the company. The commerce department and defence department have worked closely together to financially boost domestic rare earth production. A condition of the government investment in USA Rare Earth was that the company raise at least an additional $500mn from investors. It is on track to raise more than $1bn because of high demand for the financing deal, which uses a mechanism known as a private investment into a public equity, often called a “Pipe”. Cantor’s involvement comes as the investment bank once led by Lutnick, one of Trump’s most prominent cabinet members, has expanded its investment banking capabilities to benefit from the president’s “America first” agenda. Cantor did not play a role in advising on the US government investment in USA Rare Earth. Shares in USA Rare Earth have more than doubled this year, helped by a 40 per cent jump this week. The company also sought advice from Cantor when it went public via a blank cheque vehicle in March last year.",

USA Rare Earth will also receive $ 1.3bn in senior secured debt financing at market rates from the government . The money will come from a finance facility created for the commerce department as part of the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022 . A commerce official said the department completed the transaction directly with the company . Talks progressed rapidly this week as investor interest returned to critical mineral stocks after President Donald Trump said Washington had reached the “ framework ” for a deal that could include access to Greenland ’ s untapped critical mineral wealth . One person familiar with the situation noted that the USA Rare Earth deal was unrelated to Greenland . USA Rare Earth declined to comment . The commerce department declined to discuss the deal . But an official in the Chips office — a part of the commerce department housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology that led the negotiations — said it was “ focused on onshoring critical and strategic mineral essential to the semiconductor supply chain and US national security ” . USA Rare Earth has separately tapped Cantor Fitzgerald the Wall Street firm previously owned by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and now run by his sons to raise more than $ 1bn in fresh equity financing the people said . It is not_directly related to the deal with the government . The deal marks the latest example of the Trump administration ’ s efforts to intervene in parts of the private sector viewed as critical to US national security including taking a 10 per cent stake in chipmaker Intel and negotiating a socalled goldenshare agreement in US Steel . USA Rare Earth which has a market value of $ 3.7bn is developing a huge mine in Sierra Blanca Texas that it says contains 15 of the 17 rare earth elements underpinning production of cell phones missiles and fighter jets . It also plans to open a magnet production facility in Stillwater Oklahoma . Last year the Trump administration invested in at least six minerals companies including MP Materials Trilogy Metals and Lithium Americas . Some of the investments overlapped with the financial interests of people associated with the administration . The government did a funding deal with Vulcan Elements a rare earths startup three months after the president ’ s son Donald Trump Jr ’ s venture capital group invested in the company . The commerce department and defence department have worked closely together to financially boost domestic rare earth production . A condition of the government investment in USA Rare Earth was that the company raise at least an additional $ 500mn from investors . It is on track to raise more than $ 1bn because of high demand for the financing deal which uses a mechanism known as a private investment into a public equity often called a “ Pipe ” . Cantor ’ s involvement comes as the investment bank once led by Lutnick one of Trump ’ s most prominent cabinet members has expanded its investment banking capabilities to benefit from the president ’ s “ America first ” agenda . Cantor did not_play a role in advising on the US government investment in USA Rare Earth . Shares in USA Rare Earth have more than doubled this year helped by a 40 per cent jump this week . The company also sought advice from Cantor when it went public via a blank cheque vehicle in March last year ."

      "selftext": "**Full Disclosure:** I am a landman and have worked with Permian Resources on a contract basis in the past. While this has allowed me to peek under the hood, nothing contained below is privileged information. I just like the stock, the rock, and the management. Permian Resources has differentiated itself from the Delaware E&P pack through superior execution and a shareholder-friendly capital return framework. With the Q3’25 print confirming record free cash flow and raised production guidance, PR offers a compelling mix of income (**\\~4.8% yield**) and growth at a discount. Crucially, their recent reorganization (moving to a standard C-Corp) has made this the “grown-up” energy hold for my IRA, removing the complexity discount that kept big funds away. **1. The \"Why Now\": Corporate Clean-Up** On Jan 7, 2026, PR completed a major reorganization. Management and long-term holders exchanged their complicated Class C shares for standard Class A public shares. * **The Signal:** Management is now in the same boat as public shareholders (\"eating their own cooking\"). * **The Catalyst:** This removes the \"governance discount.\" Many large institutional funds automatically skip companies with complex Up-C structures. By simplifying, PR widens its buyer pool significantly. **2. Operations: The \"Ground Game\" Advantage** This is where my background matters. While the majors hunt \"elephants\" (massive corporate buyouts), PR is playing a lethal \"ground game.\" * **Q3 Stats:** They closed **\\~250 small transactions** ($180M) in a single quarter. * **Why it works:** They are picking up $100 bills on the sidewalk—singles and doubles that add inventory efficiently without paying the massive M&A premiums seen in headline deals. * **The Numbers:** Production is up to **\\~410 Mboe/d**, Leverage is a boringly safe **0.8x**, and FCF hit a record **\\~$469M**. **3. The 2026 Setup** * **Inventory:** Street consensus sees 2026 FCF potentially exceeding 2025 levels ($1B+ potential) as capital efficiency improves. * **Analyst Action:** Morgan Stanley recently adjusted their PT to $18. With the stock trading \\~ $14.78, that implies **\\~22% upside** just to the target. * **Cash Return:** You get paid to wait. The base dividend is $0.15/quarter (\\~4.1% yield on cost), plus a $1B buyback authorization sitting in the chamber. **4. Risks (The \"Landman\" Reality Check)** No well is a guarantee. Here is what I am watching: * **Waha Gas Pricing:** Delaware Basin gas differentials can be nasty. If takeaway capacity gets tight, realized pricing drops. * **Service Costs:** If 2026 drilling activity heats up, rig rates and frac crews get expensive, squeezing margins. * **Oil Beta:** Obviously, if WTI crashes to $50, the thesis pauses. **My Position** * **Long:** 1,200 shares @ $12.46 Cost Basis. * **Plan:** Accumulating on dips. * **Next Event:** Q4 Earnings & 2026 Guidance on **Feb 25, 2026**. None of this is financial advice and please do your own due diligence. That’s all for now. Will update after earnings. Good luck and keep it turning to the right!",

While this has allowed me to peek under the hood nothing_contained below is privileged information . I just like the stock the rock and the management . Permian Resources has differentiated itself from the Delaware EP pack through superior execution and a shareholderfriendly capital return framework . With the Q3 ’ 25 print confirming record free cash flow and raised production guidance PR offers a compelling mix of income 4.8 % yield and growth at a discount . Crucially their recent reorganization moving to a standard CCorp has made this the “ grownup ” energy hold for my IRA removing the complexity discount that kept big funds away . 1 . The Why Now Corporate CleanUp On Jan 7 2026 PR completed a major reorganization . Management and longterm holders exchanged their complicated Class C shares for standard Class A public shares . The Signal Management is now in the same boat as public shareholders eating their own cooking . The Catalyst This removes the governance discount . Many large institutional funds automatically skip companies with complex UpC structures . By simplifying PR widens its buyer pool significantly . 2 .

      "title": "Google is about to replace Nvidia as the world's #1 value company",
      "selftext": "The path to #1 is shorter than anyone realizes. Nvidia is sitting at roughly $4.62 Trillion while Google is at $3.99 Trillion. The magic number Google needs to hit to surpass Nvidia is $380.50. That is just a 15.8% move from the current price of roughly $328 based on the close numbers. Remember what happened when Nvidia first took the top spot? It wasn't just a number, it was a psychological trigger. The moment they hit #1, every news outlet ran the headline, ETFs rebalanced, and retail chased the winner. Right now is that same wave for Google that is building up. Once **across $380.50, the \"Google is King\" headlines start**, and the momentum buying kicks in. **The Apple capitulation leading to mobile dominance** Apple announced Gemini is going to be the default native AI for Siri. Think about the distribution monopoly they just secured. They have Gemini native on 3 billion Android devices, and now they have integration across 1.5 billion iOS devices. Google now owns the AI layer on **100% of the mobile distribution channel**. No other competitor exists at this scale. They have effectively checkmated the entire edge consumer AI market. **They are cloud leaders** Google Cloud revenue is accelerating at a rate that is frankly terrifying for Amazon and Microsoft. We are talking about parabolic revenue expansion driven by AI infrastructure demand. Q3 2025 Revenue: $15.15 billion (up **34% year-over-year**). Annualized Run Rate: The business is running at an annual pace of roughly $61 billion. Operating Income: A record $3.59 billion for the third quarter, representing a 23.7% operating margin, indicating rapidly increasing profitability. Google Cloud ended Q3 2025 with a **$155 billion backlog.** **They are entertainment leaders** Youtube surpassed Netflix (and all other streaming services) According to the latest Nielsen Gauge report, YouTube captured 13.4% of total TV time, Netflix at 8.8%. Also Netflix: 325M subscribers come for a specific show and siappear when it;s over (like now with stranger things) while YouTube which has 2 Billion users who keep coming back to long form and shorts from never ending list of creators the algorithm know they would like. **Google has it's own silicon** Google has been building its own TPUs for a decade, meaning they don't pay the \"Nvidia Tax\" that crushes other tech companies margins. Google can later on sell these chips to other hyperscalers. Can you imagine Microsoft or Meta running on Google silicon? If they confirm this new revenue stream the stock goes nuclear. They instantly become a potential top-tier AI chip supplier with massive margins, they even go for rent model like IREN or CRWV. This is a multi-billion dollar catalyst that is currently not being priced. **Even the valuation show's google is STILL mispriced** Right now the market is paying a massive premium for Nvidia's future while ignoring Google's present cash flow. Look at the P/E ratio comparison. Google 32.6x P/E. For Nvidia,45.8x P/E. **That makes Google roughly 29% cheaper on PE valuation basis.** If Google were simply valued at the same multiple as Nvidia, its stock price would be roughly $460. to hit $400 target, al is needed is taht the valuation gap to narrow slightly. **Wall Street is quietly loading up** Raymond James just upgraded to a Strong Buy with a $400 target. Pivotal Research reaffirmed their Buy rating with a $400 target. Canaccord raised their target to $390. they are all converging on the same number right before the earnings. **The non digital assets** Pixel 10 sales were up 28% year-over-year in September, capturing **7% of the US premium market** and stealing share directly from Samsung. And Waymo driverless taxi is no longer a side project. They are doing **450,000 paid rides** per week. They are live in Phoenix, SF, LA, and expanding fast. **TLDR** Google is winning on search, youtube, ads, cloud, AI Chip, driverless cars, mobile phones and is about to become the world's most valuable company. **On Feb 4th earnings call it will surge to the crossover point at $380.50 and after the call continue to $400.** \\*I’m holding 10k USD worth of $375C for Feb 6. I am calling Google at $400. I know that most of you are holding GOOG, so good luck tp us all. Next earnings: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) will hold its quarterly conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 financial results on Wednesday, February 4, at 1:30pm Pacific Time (4:30pm Eastern Time).

      "selftext_processed": "The path to 1 is shorter than anyone realizes . Nvidia is sitting at roughly $ 4.62 Trillion while Google is at $ 3.99 Trillion . The magic number Google needs to hit to surpass Nvidia is $ 380.50 . That is just a 15.8 % move from the current price of roughly $ 328 based on the close numbers . Remember what happened when Nvidia first took the top spot It wasnt just a number it was a psychological trigger . The moment they hit 1 every news outlet ran the headline ETFs rebalanced and retail chased the winner . Right now is that same wave for Google that is building up . Once across $ 380.50 the Google is King headlines start and the momentum buying kicks in . The Apple capitulation leading to mobile dominance Apple announced Gemini is going to be the default native AI for Siri . Think about the distribution monopoly they just secured . They have Gemini native on 3 billion Android devices and now they have integration across 1.5 billion iOS devices . Google now owns the AI layer on 100 % of the mobile distribution channel . No_other competitor exists at this scale . They have effectively checkmated the entire edge consumer AI market . They are cloud leaders Google Cloud revenue is accelerating at a rate that is frankly terrifying for Amazon and Microsoft . We are talking about parabolic revenue expansion driven by AI infrastructure demand . Q3 2025 Revenue $ 15.15 billion up 34 % yearoveryear . Annualized Run Rate The business is running at an annual pace of roughly $ 61 billion . Operating Income A record $ 3.59 billion for the third quarter representing a 23.7 % operating margin indicating rapidly increasing profitability . Google Cloud ended Q3 2025 with a $ 155 billion backlog . They are entertainment leaders Youtube surpassed Netflix and all other streaming services According to the latest Nielsen Gauge report YouTube captured 13.4 % of total TV time Netflix at 8.8 % . Also Netflix 325M subscribers come for a specific show and siappear when its over like now with stranger things while YouTube which has 2 Billion users who keep coming back to long form and shorts from never_ending list of creators the algorithm know they would like . Google has its own silicon Google has been building its own TPUs for a decade meaning they dont pay the Nvidia Tax that crushes other tech companies margins . Google can later on sell these chips to other hyperscalers . Can you imagine Microsoft or Meta running on Google silicon If they confirm this new revenue stream the stock goes nuclear . They instantly become a potential toptier AI chip supplier with massive margins they even go for rent model like IREN or CRWV . This is a multibillion dollar catalyst that is currently not_being priced . Even the valuation shows google is STILL mispriced Right now the market is paying a massive premium for Nvidias future while ignoring Googles present cash flow . Look at the PE ratio comparison . Google 32.6x PE . For Nvidia45.8x PE . That makes Google roughly 29 % cheaper on PE valuation basis . If Google were simply valued at the same multiple as Nvidia its stock price would be roughly $ 460 . to hit $ 400 target al is needed is taht the valuation gap to narrow slightly . Wall Street is quietly loading up Raymond James just upgraded to a Strong Buy with a $ 400 target . Pivotal Research reaffirmed their Buy rating with a $ 400 target . Canaccord raised their target to $ 390 . they are all converging on the same number right before the earnings . The non digital assets Pixel 10 sales were up 28 % yearoveryear in September capturing 7 % of the US premium market and stealing share directly from Samsung . And Waymo driverless taxi is no_longer a side project . They are doing 450000 paid rides per week . They are live in Phoenix SF LA and expanding fast . TLDR Google is winning on search youtube ads cloud AI Chip driverless cars mobile phones and is about to become the worlds most valuable company . On Feb 4th earnings call it will surge to the crossover point at $ 380.50 and after the call continue to $ 400 . I ’ m holding 10k USD worth of $ 375C for Feb 6 . I am calling Google at $ 400 . I know that most of you are holding GOOG so good luck tp us all . Next earnings Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ GOOG GOOGL will hold its quarterly conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 financial results on Wednesday February 4 at 130pm Pacific Time 430pm Eastern Time .

      "selftext": "If you had bought four shares of Nvidia at its 1999 IPO, it would have cost you about $48. After stock splits and one of the most extreme compounding runs in market history, those four original shares would today be worth just under $500,000. Now imagine applying that same compounding logic to SpaceX, even if it does not start small. Assume, conservatively, that any eventual public pricing begins around a $1.5 trillion valuation. That number sounds enormous until you shift the frame from cheap to foundational. The companies that generated generational wealth over the last 30 to 40 years were not just successful businesses. They became infrastructure. SpaceX is positioning itself in exactly that role, not merely as a rocket company, but as a transportation, launch, communications, and orbital logistics platform. If you care about truly building wealth, the kind you can give to your kids, the kind that pays for college and maybe even helps them buy their first home, I cannot think of a better company than SpaceX. It is still pre-IPO, but it is not hard to imagine a future where Musk works out some mechanism that allows ordinary people to buy in early. Maybe even young couples, with one simple condition, that they are actually building families. Population decline is a real problem, and it is something Musk talks about openly and often. This part is admittedly wishful thinking, and it may not even be legal as described, though history suggests there are always ways to make things possible when incentives align. Can't wait for the IPO! TLDR: SPACE X will be a long-term buy and hold as they are building out the larger space infrastructure.",

      "selftext": "I am 19 years old. I had around 50,000$ saved up and most of it was invested in the S&P 500. I have always tried to live in a way I worked and I saved my money and I tried to be very disciplined, with my spending. I made sure to put my money into the S&P 500 because I thought it was an investment. A days ago I made a huge mistake. I did something wrong and it was all my fault. I totally messed things up with my actions. The mistake I made was an one. It happened a few days ago. I was trading options. I lost a big part of my money fifty percent of my capital all in one day. Trading options can be really bad, for me I mean I was doing okay. Then I made some bad choices. Now I have lost a lot of my capital. I am talking about options trading it is a risk I lost fifty percent of my capital in just one day of options trading. The thing that makes it worse is the reason I did it. I think about why I did it and that's what makes it worse. Doing it was bad. The reason I did the thing is what really makes it worse. I was really close to making a mistake with my money. I was going to put ten thousand dollars into an options trade because it felt right.. Then I thought about it. I knew it was a bad idea. It was too risky and not very smart. So I did not do it. A few hours went by. Then I heard some news, about Trump and what he thinks about Greenland. If I had made that trade I would have gotten a lot of money seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I was lucky I did not make that trade because I would have been doing it for the reasons. The trade would have worked out well. It was still a bad idea to do it just because it felt right. I am glad I did not put my money into that options trade even though it would have made me a lot of money. That really messed with my head. Seeing that absolutely broke something in my head it was like my brain just stopped working. Seeing that was a shock, to me. I was really mad at myself for missing that trade I kept thinking that I was right. That is when I started trading to get back at the market. I stopped doing all the things that I knew were good, for me. I did not have a plan. I was not managing my risk. I was only thinking about how I felt. I let my emotions take over. I was only thinking about revenge trading. My savings have really taken a hit now half of my savings are gone. I had a lot of money in my savings. Now half of my savings are just not there anymore. I feel sick. I am ashamed and I am honestly devastated. I just cannot stop thinking about what happened over in my head. My life is young. I still have a lot of time but the way I feel right now is that I ruined my life and I threw away years of being good and working hard because of one really stupid thing I did. I keep thinking about my life. How I feel like I made a big mistake. My life and my choices are really bothering me. If anyone has gone through something like this. With options or gambling or trying to get back at the market by revenge trading. I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice, on options and gambling and revenge trading. • how to mentally recover • how to forgive yourself • and how to move forward without self-destructing again Right now, I feel completely lost. TL;DR: I’m 19. Had ~$50k saved (mostly S&P 500). Lost 50% of it in one day trading options after revenge trading. Missed a risky trade that would’ve turned $10k into ~$750k, got angry, abandoned discipline, and blew up half my savings. Now I feel devastated and like I ruined my life. Looking for advice on how to mentally recover and move forward.",

I have always tried to live in a way I worked and I saved my money and I tried to be very disciplined with my spending . I made sure to put my money into the SP 500 because I thought it was an investment . A days ago I made a huge mistake . I did something wrong and it was all my fault . I totally messed things up with my actions . The mistake I made was an one . It happened a few days ago . I was trading options . I lost a big part of my money fifty percent of my capital all in one day . Trading options can be really bad for me I mean I was doing okay . Then I made some bad choices . Now I have lost a lot of my capital . I am talking about options trading it is a risk I lost fifty percent of my capital in just one day of options trading . The thing that makes it worse is the reason I did it . I think about why I did it and thats what makes it worse . Doing it was bad . The reason I did the thing is what really makes it worse . I was really close to making a mistake with my money . I was going to put ten thousand dollars into an options trade because it felt right .. Then I thought about it . I knew it was a bad idea . It was too risky and not_very smart . So I did not_do it . A few hours went by . Then I heard some news about Trump and what he thinks about Greenland . If I had made that trade I would have gotten a lot of money seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars . I was lucky I did not_make that trade because I would have been doing it for the reasons . The trade would have worked out well . It was still a bad idea to do it just because it felt right . I am glad I did not_put my money into that options trade even though it would have made me a lot of money . That really messed with my head . Seeing that absolutely broke something in my head it was like my brain just stopped working . Seeing that was a shock to me . I was really mad at myself for missing that trade I kept thinking that I was right . That is when I started trading to get back at the market . I stopped doing all the things that I knew were good for me . I did not_have a plan . I was not_managing my risk . I was only thinking about how I felt . I let my emotions take over . I was only thinking about revenge trading . My savings have really taken a hit now half of my savings are gone . I had a lot of money in my savings . Now half of my savings are just not_there anymore . I feel sick . I am ashamed and I am honestly devastated . I just can not stop thinking about what happened over in my head . My life is young . I still have a lot of time but the way I feel right now is that I ruined my life and I threw away years of being good and working hard because of one really stupid thing I did . I keep thinking about my life . How I feel like I made a big mistake . My life and my choices are really bothering me . If anyone has gone through something like this . With options or gambling or trying to get back at the market by revenge trading . I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice on options and gambling and revenge trading . • how to mentally recover • how to forgive yourself • and how to move forward without selfdestructing again Right now I feel completely lost . TLDR I ’ m 19 . Had $ 50k saved mostly SP 500 . Lost 50 % of it in one day trading options after revenge trading . Missed a risky trade that would ’ ve turned $ 10k into $ 750k got angry abandoned discipline and blew up half my savings . Now I feel devastated and like I ruined my life .

      "title": "Why it’s not too late to get in: The Asymmetric Case for Nebius ($NBIS)",
      "selftext": "*Current Price: \\~$95* *Market Capitalization: \\~$24B* *Recommendation: Long* While the broader market remains cautious, a quantitative dissection of the forward-looking order book suggests Nebius Group ($NBIS) is currently trading at a dislocation from its fundamental value. Below is the thesis for why Nebius represents a highly asymmetric infrastructure trade for the 2026 cycle. **1. The Velocity of Revenue Recognition** The market is currently pricing $NBIS based on trailing indicators, largely ignoring the contracted revenue ramp scheduled to materialize over the next 12–24 months. We are looking at a potential year-over-year revenue acceleration of 521% to 1,400% between 2025 and 2026. This is not a speculative forecast derived from TAM (Total Addressable Market) assumptions; it is a function of a $20B+ backlog of unfilled orders. Crucially, more than 50% of the company's projected 2026 ARR is already locked in via binding contracts. \\* 2025E (Fiscal Year): Revenue of $500–550M; Exit ARR of $900M–$1.1B. \\* 2026E (Guidance): Revenue expands to $3.45–7B; ARR target of $7–9B. \\* 2027E (Consensus): Revenue projected at $7.8–9B. \\* 2028E: Revenue projected to exceed $14B. **2. Structural De-Risking Events** Three specific catalysts have recently materialized, effectively transforming the risk profile of the equity: \\* Product Maturity (AI Cloud 3.1): The January 2026 launch of the AI Cloud 3.1 platform, integrating Nvidia Blackwell GPUs with proprietary \"Capacity Blocks,\" real-time dashboards, and compliance architecture, moves Nebius beyond simple GPU arbitrage. It positions the firm as a full-stack enterprise cloud alternative. \\* Infrastructure Scale: Management has revised its 2026 contracted power capacity target upward from 1 GW to 2.5 GW. This physical capacity is the prerequisite \"supply\" needed to service the verified backlog. \\* Counterparty Quality: The backlog is anchored by multi-year infrastructure agreements with Microsoft and Meta. These are long-duration commitments from investment-grade counterparties, not volatile usage-based revenue from venture-backed startups. **3. The Valuation Compression Thesis** Skeptics often cite the current \\~50x price-to-sales multiple (on 2025E revenue) as a barrier to entry. However, this view fails to account for the velocity of the denominator (revenue) growth. As the backlog converts to recognized revenue, the optical valuation compresses rapidly: \\* 2026E: At the $3.45–7B revenue range, the multiple compresses to 7–13x sales. \\* 2027E: At the $9B consensus projection, the multiple compresses to 4–5x sales. Given the $4.79B cash position on the balance sheet, the company is fully capitalized to execute this growth phase without immediate dilution risk. **4. Price Target Sensitivity Analysis** Applying standard growth-adjusted multiples to the company's guidance illustrates the convexity of the trade. From a cost basis of $95, the potential upside scenarios are substantial. (Calculations on potential price see the photo in the header). **5. Institutional Consensus vs. Market Price** A distinct gap exists between institutional pricing models and current market action. At $95, shares are trading 40% below the average analyst price target and 55% below the street-high target. \\* Northland Securities: $211 (122% Upside) \\* Citizens JMP: $175 (84% Upside) \\* Consensus Mean: $157.83 (66% Upside) \\* Sentiment: 5 Buys / 1 Hold / 0 Sells **Summary** The retracement from the October highs of $141 provides an attractive entry point. Fundamental performance remains robust, evidenced by Q3 2025 revenue of $146.1M (+355% YoY) and core infrastructure growth of +400%. With a clear path to $5B+ in EBITDA by 2027 and a verified $20B+ backlog, I view $NBIS as the premier infrastructure play for the 2026 vintage. I remain a buyer at these levels. *Disclaimer: This analysis is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.* **If you like my posts, please also take a look at my Substack in bio.**",

      "selftext_processed": "Current Price $ 95 Market Capitalization $ 24B Recommendation Long While the broader market remains cautious a quantitative dissection of the forwardlooking order book suggests Nebius Group $ NBIS is currently trading at a dislocation from its fundamental value . Below is the thesis for why Nebius represents a highly asymmetric infrastructure trade for the 2026 cycle . 1 . The Velocity of Revenue Recognition The market is currently pricing $ NBIS based on trailing indicators largely ignoring the contracted revenue ramp scheduled to materialize over the next 12–24 months . We are looking at a potential yearoveryear revenue acceleration of 521 % to 1400 % between 2025 and 2026 . This is not_a speculative forecast derived from TAM Total Addressable Market assumptions it is a function of a $ 20B backlog of unfilled orders . Crucially more than 50 % of the companys projected 2026 ARR is already locked in via binding contracts . 2025E Fiscal Year Revenue of $ 500–550M Exit ARR of $ 900M– $ 1.1B . 2026E Guidance Revenue expands to $ 3.45–7B ARR target of $ 7–9B . 2027E Consensus Revenue projected at $ 7.8–9B . 2028E Revenue projected to exceed $ 14B . 2 . Structural DeRisking Events Three specific catalysts have recently materialized effectively transforming the risk profile of the equity Product Maturity AI Cloud 3.1 The January 2026 launch of the AI Cloud 3.1 platform integrating Nvidia Blackwell GPUs with proprietary Capacity Blocks realtime dashboards and compliance architecture moves Nebius beyond simple GPU arbitrage . It positions the firm as a fullstack enterprise cloud alternative . Infrastructure Scale Management has revised its 2026 contracted power capacity target upward from 1 GW to 2.5 GW . This physical capacity is the prerequisite supply needed to service the verified backlog . Counterparty Quality The backlog is anchored by multiyear infrastructure agreements with Microsoft and Meta . These are longduration commitments from investmentgrade counterparties not_volatile usagebased revenue from venturebacked startups . 3 . The Valuation Compression Thesis Skeptics often cite the current 50x pricetosales multiple on 2025E revenue as a barrier to entry . However this view fails to account for the velocity of the denominator revenue growth . As the backlog converts to recognized revenue the optical valuation compresses rapidly 2026E At the $ 3.45–7B revenue range the multiple compresses to 7–13x sales . 2027E At the $ 9B consensus projection the multiple compresses to 4–5x sales . Given the $ 4.79B cash position on the balance sheet the company is fully capitalized to execute this growth phase without immediate dilution risk . 4 . Price Target Sensitivity Analysis Applying standard growthadjusted multiples to the companys guidance illustrates the convexity of the trade . From a cost basis of $ 95 the potential upside scenarios are substantial . Calculations on potential price see the photo in the header . 5 . Institutional Consensus vs. Market Price A distinct gap exists between institutional pricing models and current market action . At $ 95 shares are trading 40 % below the average analyst price target and 55 % below the streethigh target . Northland Securities $ 211 122 % Upside Citizens JMP $ 175 84 % Upside Consensus Mean $ 157.83 66 % Upside Sentiment 5 Buys 1 Hold 0 Sells Summary The retracement from the October highs of $ 141 provides an attractive entry point . Fundamental performance remains robust evidenced by Q3 2025 revenue of $ 146.1M 355 % YoY and core infrastructure growth of 400 % . With a clear path to $ 5B in EBITDA by 2027 and a verified $ 20B backlog I view $ NBIS as the premier infrastructure play for the 2026 vintage . I remain a buyer at these levels .

      "selftext": "JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and the likes incorrectly estimated that the S&P500 would beat the FTSE100 in 2025, I believe the same fundamental's that caused this will still exist in 2026. 1. Value Matters British Stocks have a lower average P/E ratio versus the S&P500s, with an average P/E of 17 to the S&P's 28. This is typically due to lower growth estimates and a smaller tech stack. British infrastructure stocks have announced record investment in recent years, and will still provide their relatively larger dividends. 2. AI Insulation The IMF issued a warning this week about the effect of a pop in a potential AI bubble. US stocks are of course the most exposed to any potential AI downside and are relying on strong earnings reports this year. 3. Long Term Stability Trump's stance on Greenland has provided a unifying point for European politics. The effect Trump had on switching the outcome of the latest Canadian election, is being seen to a lesser extent across nations in Europe. On the otherside, a potenitally bias Fed chair in the US will tip the scales further. 4. Improving Regulatory Outlook At Davos this week Macron highlighted Europe's overregulation. This being brought up so publicly creates positive sentiment towards improved offerings across the continent and highlights recent genuine measures to cut red tape 5. USD Decline Even if European stocks do not intrinsically outperform the S&P 500, every time the world is graced with another truth social post, the USD falls. The USD was down 10% in 2025. 6. Trumpism As an outsider with no skin in the game I was concerned watching Biden's performance degrade over his term. Did Biden's health and performance improve over his presidency? Why would President Trump's be any different? If threatening to invade allies is Trump's Year 1, how exposed do I want to be to his year 4? In the FTSE, your portfolio will be better insulated from Trump's degrading mental health: \\-You are not going to have your stock's key product banned overnight (wind turbines) \\-Or key manufaturing imports tariffed (Canada's automotive imputs) \\-Nor will you be caught on the wrong side of one of their more apparent government back pump and dumps. \\-For as long as Trump is in power, he is unpredictable, but predictably more volatile as he gets older. TLDR; I am bullish on Europe, because Trumps degrading of American assets is either directly benefiting the Europeans, or scaring the Europeans into action. I am not saying go 0% US, but if you are sitting 100% US, maybe now is time to consider diversifying.",

Value Matters British Stocks have a lower average PE ratio versus the SP500s with an average PE of 17 to the SPs 28 . This is typically due to lower growth estimates and a smaller tech stack . British infrastructure stocks have announced record investment in recent years and will still provide their relatively larger dividends . 2 . AI Insulation The IMF issued a warning this week about the effect of a pop in a potential AI bubble . US stocks are of course the most exposed to any potential AI downside and are relying on strong earnings reports this year . 3 . Long Term Stability Trumps stance on Greenland has provided a unifying point for European politics . The effect Trump had on switching the outcome of the latest Canadian election is being seen to a lesser extent across nations in Europe . On the otherside a potenitally bias Fed chair in the US will tip the scales further . 4 . Improving Regulatory Outlook At Davos this week Macron highlighted Europes overregulation . This being brought up so publicly creates positive sentiment towards improved offerings across the continent and highlights recent genuine measures to cut red tape 5 . USD Decline Even if European stocks do not_intrinsically outperform the SP 500 every time the world is graced with another truth social post the USD falls . The USD was down 10 % in 2025 . 6 . Trumpism As an outsider with no_skin in the game I was concerned watching Bidens performance degrade over his term . Did Bidens health and performance improve over his presidency Why would President Trumps be any different If threatening to invade allies is Trumps Year 1 how exposed do I want to be to his year 4 In the FTSE your portfolio will be better insulated from Trumps degrading mental health You are not_going to have your stocks key product banned overnight wind turbines Or key manufaturing imports tariffed Canadas automotive imputs Nor will you be caught on the wrong side of one of their more apparent government back pump and dumps . For as long as Trump is in power he is unpredictable but predictably more volatile as he gets older . TLDR I am bullish on Europe because Trumps degrading of American assets is either directly benefiting the Europeans or scaring the Europeans into action . I am not_saying go 0 % US but if you are sitting 100 % US maybe now is time to consider diversifying ."

      "selftext": "MANAGEMENT IS NOT INSANE, THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS Dilution isn't *as* bad as it seems, as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year, but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing Snapchat glasses are releasing this year IT DOSEN'T MATTER IF THE GLASSES FLOP IT DOES NOT, IF IT FLOPS ITS GOOD EVEN If the glasses fail he will scraps them, Snapchat will save roughly $1B a year in R&D, turns cash-flow positive, slows dilution, buys back more stock, and the market probably re-rates the company. If the glasses actually work, the upside is even bigger. Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never scrapped the project, but I believe this time is different. Looking back at 2016, this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no other tech giant had entered the arena. They rushed a product into a market that wasn’t ready, with technology that was too early for its time. The versions failed for simple reasons, including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn’t advanced enough. By 2021, while they finally had actual augmented reality, the battery life was horrible. One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $400 million/year deal with Perplexity. Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat, and this is huge for both companies. Young people love AI and they love Snapchat. It’s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity, likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year. It’s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity’s AI in its glasses. One thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage. Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat+ for a small premium. This is huge, as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memory/storage features, and soon they will be charging for it. Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company, but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave. **Q2 2025 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): \\~$2.87 / 3 ≈ $0.96 per user per month** Snapchat+ is $3.99 per month. For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs, just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back. So the answer to my question is: yes, the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave, from a financial standpoint. And let’s be honest—the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal. They likely won’t save their photos to the app, but users will still use the app. One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don’t want to pay is that they’ll end up saving storage costs for the company, lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG. Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for. Meta’s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms, unlike Snapchat’s, which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers; it’s not just a status thing. “Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. We completed this program in May 2025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $500.6 million, including costs associated with the repurchases.” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2025, Snap had $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This means dilution, despite still being high, is much lower than what others are reporting. They bought back $500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025. RSUs were valued at $1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $1 billion in 2024–2025, which is by no means low, but it’s important to mention that no one mentions the buybacks. Numbers are better, everything from EPS, revenue is better then 2022, but the stock is down 50% from this time, primarily due to them burning cash (which will end once they release these glasses) and Apple's ad policy change Snapchat+ is growing steadily, making them 700 million/year A question many are asking is why Snapchat+ was released in 2022, yet the stock declined massively. This thought process is completely correct, but it’s important to look at why they’ve had massive drops during this time. Apple’s IDFA (privacy) changes, the post-pandemic tech stock drops, and the large cash burned on R&D were the main reasons for the stock dropping. However, a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money, and that they’re stepping away to other business models, which is huge. Snapchat is innovating—every quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and non-paid subscribers. Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company, and Snapchat is not letting their app die.",

      "selftext_processed": "MANAGEMENT IS NOT_INSANE THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS Dilution isnt as bad as it seems as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing Snapchat glasses are releasing this year IT DOSENT MATTER IF THE GLASSES FLOP IT DOES NOT_IF IT FLOPS ITS GOOD EVEN If the glasses fail he will scraps them Snapchat will save roughly $ 1B a year in RD turns cashflow positive slows dilution buys back more stock and the market probably rerates the company . If the glasses actually work the upside is even bigger . Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never_scrapped the project but I believe this time is different . Looking back at 2016 this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no_other tech giant had entered the arena . They rushed a product into a market that wasn ’ t ready with technology that was too early for its time . The versions failed for simple reasons including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn ’ t advanced enough . By 2021 while they finally had actual augmented reality the battery life was horrible . One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $ 400 millionyear deal with Perplexity . Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat and this is huge for both companies . Young people love AI and they love Snapchat . It ’ s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year . It ’ s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity ’ s AI in its glasses . One thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage . Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat for a small premium . This is huge as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memorystorage features and soon they will be charging for it . Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave . Q2 2025 ARPU Average Revenue Per User $ 2.87 3 ≈ $ 0.96 per user per month Snapchat is $ 3.99 per month . For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back . So the answer to my question is yes the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave from a financial standpoint . And let ’ s be honest—the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal . They likely won ’ t save their photos to the app but users will still use the app . One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don ’ t want to pay is that they ’ ll end up saving storage costs for the company lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG . Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for . Meta ’ s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms unlike Snapchat ’ s which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers it ’ s not_just a status thing . “ Stock Repurchases In October 2024 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 500.0 million of our Class A common stock . We completed this program in May 2025 . For the nine months ended September 30 2025 we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $ 500.6 million including costs associated with the repurchases. ” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents . As of September 30 2025 Snap had $ 3.0 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities . This means dilution despite still being high is much lower than what others are reporting . They bought back $ 500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025 . RSUs were valued at $ 1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $ 1 billion in 2024–2025 which is by no_means low but it ’ s important to mention that no_one mentions the buybacks . Numbers are better everything from EPS revenue is better then 2022 but the stock is down 50 % from this time primarily due to them burning cash which will end once they release these glasses and Apples ad policy change Snapchat is growing steadily making them 700 millionyear A question many are asking is why Snapchat was released in 2022 yet the stock declined massively . This thought process is completely correct but it ’ s important to look at why they ’ ve had massive drops during this time . Apple ’ s IDFA privacy changes the postpandemic tech stock drops and the large cash burned on RD were the main reasons for the stock dropping . However a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money and that they ’ re stepping away to other business models which is huge . Snapchat is innovating—every quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and nonpaid subscribers . Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company and Snapchat is not_letting their app die ."

Averaged down a few times and then market took a nice little dump with about 90 mins left. Don’t worry - I bought about $275k of shares that I will not touch. As much as you want to see me blow this account to 0, I will not let it happen. Also bought about $75k of some longer dated calls yesterday pre-close on some beaten down stocks (LULU, CRM, RDDT, INTC, PYPL) which all ran nicely today. I have about $350k invested. Also transferred in $50k from my other account for those of you who will be doing the math (this is now all my money). Buying power is because it includes available margin. Might yolo on some ODTE stonks tomorrow since it’s Friday.",

I told myself I could use $ 30k to yolo on OTDEs as a treat for my win . Averaged down a few times and then market took a nice little dump with about 90 mins left . Don ’ t worry I bought about $ 275k of shares that I will not_touch . As much as you want to see me blow this account to 0 I will not_let it happen . Also bought about $ 75k of some longer dated calls yesterday preclose on some beaten down stocks LULU CRM RDDT INTC PYPL which all ran nicely today . I have about $ 350k invested . Also transferred in $ 50k from my other account for those of you who will be doing the math this is now all my money . Buying power is because it includes available margin . Might yolo on some ODTE stonks tomorrow since it ’ s Friday ."

      "selftext": "As English is not my first language, I have used Gemini to help me. But you know what, see the positions first, cause that is all you degens care about and now the part which 99% of you guys wont read: So I have been digging through the biotech trash heap looking for gold, and I think I found the only ticker that Mr. Market is completely sleeping on. We are talking about **Altimmune ($ALT)**. If you’ve been watching the GLP-1 space (Lilly, Novo), you know the \"fat loss\" trade is crowded. But $ALT just pivoted to the holy grail: **MASH (liver disease) + Weight Loss.** And the setup right now is looking like a powder keg waiting for a match. Here is the DD. # 1. The Data is absolute fire (FDA Agrees) The market punished this thing last year because they wanted \"just another weight loss drug.\" $ALT gave them something better: **Pemvidutide.** * **BTD CONFIRMED:** As of Jan 5, 2026, the FDA granted them **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)** for MASH. This is huge. It means the FDA sees \"substantial improvement\" over existing therapies. This is also means chances of approval are now over 75%, FDA wants this drug **LET ME SAY THIS IN CAPS - BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL, only around 1/3 of applications gets accepted, and it tells big Pharma, FDA wants this drug, come fucking buy** * **The Kicker:** Unlike Madrigal’s drug (Rezdiffra) which just treats the liver, $ALT’s drug shreds fat too. Patients hit **7.5% weight loss at 48 weeks** on the high dose, and the chart showed *no plateau* (meaning they were still losing weight). It’s a two-for-one special: Fix the liver, lose the gut. # 2. The \"For Sale\" Sign is Blinking This is the most bullish part. Look at the C-Suite changes. They aren't building a 20-year dynasty; they are dressing the bride for a wedding. * **New CEO (Jan 2026):** Jerry Durso. Who is he? He was the CEO of Intercept Pharmaceuticals. **He literally just sold Intercept to Alfasigma.** He knows exactly how to package a liver drug for a buyout. * **New CFO (Nov 2024):** Greg Weaver. This guy was the CFO at Sirna (sold to Merck) and ILEX (sold to Genzyme). * **Translation:** You don't hire a liquidation squad if you plan to run independent trials for the next decade. # 3. Valuation is a Joke (The Value Play) Let’s look at the comps. This is why it’s the best value on the board. * **Madrigal ($MDGL):** Multi-Billion market cap. (Commercial stage, but expensive). * **Viking ($VKTX):** \\~$8B+ market cap. * Novo also got some company in this space for billions * **Altimmune ($ALT):** **\\~$450M - $550M Market Cap.** It is trading at cash + a handshake. If this gets even *half* the valuation of its peers, it’s a multi-bagger. The Phase 3 setup is fully aligned with the FDA. The ship is loaded. # 4. The Catalyst & The Risk * **The Hype:** The stock started heating up at the JPM Healthcare Conference (Jan 2026). Big Pharma is swimming in cash and looking for MASH assets because their patents are expiring. * **The Risk (The Bear Case):** Cash. They have \\~$210M (as of late 2025). Phase 3 is expensive. * *Scenario A:* They dilute. Stock dips, we cry, then it recovers. * *Scenario B:* Partnership (Non-dilutive cash). Stock moons. * *Scenario C:* Buyout. We retire. # Summary They have the **Data** (BTD granted), they have the **Management** (literally hired guys who sell companies), and they have the **Market Cap** (insanely low compared to peers). This isn't a pure obesity play anymore; it's the leading **MASH play** that makes you skinny. **TL;DR:** * **Ticker:** $ALT * **Catalyst:** FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation + Phase 3 start. * **Upside:** 3-5x to catch up to peer valuations. * **Risk:** Cash burn/Dilution (unless they partner/sell first). * **Prediction:** Jerry Durso didn't take this job to work a 9-5. He took it to sign a deal. bonus - 21% SI Not financial advice, but this could 2x to 10x , who the hell knows, but is should fly baby fly It ran 20 percent today for a reason.... Many people saying AI bots. Check my history, I am as degen and idiotic as any other regard. Now who comments on the threads, I can't control. Bonus - weight loss means bigger peepee Edit - if you guys made money take your profits. It's run harder than I thought, still keep skin in the game.",

      "selftext_processed": "As English is not_my first language I have used Gemini to help me . But you know what see the positions first cause that is all you degens care about and now the part which 99 % of you guys wont read So I have been digging through the biotech trash heap looking for gold and I think I found the only ticker that Mr. Market is completely sleeping on . We are talking about Altimmune $ ALT . If you ’ ve been watching the GLP1 space Lilly Novo you know the fat loss trade is crowded . But $ ALT just pivoted to the holy grail MASH liver disease Weight Loss . And the setup right now is looking like a powder keg waiting for a match . Here is the DD . 1 . The Data is absolute fire FDA Agrees The market punished this thing last year because they wanted just another weight loss drug . $ ALT gave them something better Pemvidutide . BTD CONFIRMED As of Jan 5 2026 the FDA granted them Breakthrough Therapy Designation BTD for MASH . This is huge . It means the FDA sees substantial improvement over existing therapies . This is also means chances of approval are now over 75 % FDA wants this drug LET ME SAY THIS IN CAPS BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL only around 13 of applications gets accepted and it tells big Pharma FDA wants this drug come fucking buy The Kicker Unlike Madrigal ’ s drug Rezdiffra which just treats the liver $ ALT ’ s drug shreds fat too . Patients hit 7.5 % weight loss at 48 weeks on the high dose and the chart showed no plateau meaning they were still losing weight . It ’ s a twoforone special Fix the liver lose the gut . 2 . The For Sale Sign is Blinking This is the most bullish part . Look at the CSuite changes . They arent building a 20year dynasty they are dressing the bride for a wedding . New CEO Jan 2026 Jerry Durso . Who is he He was the CEO of Intercept Pharmaceuticals . He literally just sold Intercept to Alfasigma . He knows exactly how to package a liver drug for a buyout . New CFO Nov 2024 Greg Weaver . This guy was the CFO at Sirna sold to Merck and ILEX sold to Genzyme . Translation You dont hire a liquidation squad if you plan to run independent trials for the next decade . 3 . Valuation is a Joke The Value Play Let ’ s look at the comps . This is why it ’ s the best value on the board . Madrigal $ MDGL MultiBillion market cap . Commercial stage but expensive . Viking $ VKTX $ 8B market cap . Novo also got some company in this space for billions Altimmune $ ALT $ 450M $ 550M Market Cap . It is trading at cash a handshake . If this gets even half the valuation of its peers it ’ s a multibagger . The Phase 3 setup is fully aligned with the FDA . The ship is loaded . 4 . The Catalyst The Risk The Hype The stock started heating up at the JPM Healthcare Conference Jan 2026 . Big Pharma is swimming in cash and looking for MASH assets because their patents are expiring . The Risk The Bear Case Cash . They have $ 210M as of late 2025 . Phase 3 is expensive . Scenario A They dilute . Stock dips we cry then it recovers . Scenario B Partnership Nondilutive cash . Stock moons . Scenario C Buyout . We retire . Summary They have the Data BTD granted they have the Management literally hired guys who sell companies and they have the Market Cap insanely low compared to peers . This isnt a pure obesity play anymore its the leading MASH play that makes you skinny . TLDR Ticker $ ALT Catalyst FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation Phase 3 start . Upside 35x to catch up to peer valuations . Risk Cash burnDilution unless they partnersell first . Prediction Jerry Durso didnt take this job to work a 95 . He took it to sign a deal . bonus 21 % SI Not_financial advice but this could 2x to 10x who the hell knows but is should fly baby fly It ran 20 percent today for a reason .... Many people saying AI bots . Check my history I am as degen and idiotic as any other regard . Now who comments on the threads I cant control . Bonus weight loss means bigger peepee Edit if you guys made money take your profits . Its run harder than I thought still keep skin in the game ."

      "selftext": "After conducting several rounds of expert calls with the meteorological expert panel known as chatgpt, claude & gemini, as well as analyzing the latest weather models from anime pfp's on twitter, I have arrived at the conclusion that America's energy infrastructure is about to be hit by the Mother Of All Snow Storms (MOASS). As a great American once said, never let a good crisis go to waste. To figure out how to capitalize on this opportunity, I looked to the work of this highly helpful Texas Consumer Association NGO that explains the \"massive windfall key industry players made during the freeze. **Energy Transfer posted its highest quarterly net income on record**, more than three times its previous best quarter\". [ $ET made a killing off Winter Storm Uri in 2021, thanks to a massive energy storage and logistics network of assets that was primed to capitalize on market dislocations from the crisis. Just look at their CEO, I am sure glad to be on his side of the table on these energy deals. I am betting on a repeat of the 2021 bonanza over this weekend, hence the yolo. Disclosures: I am not a financial professional, my own findings and financial decisions were made based on AI slop and trust me bro twitter research, and should not be the basis for anyone else's decisions.",

As a great American once said never_let a good crisis go to waste . To figure out how to capitalize on this opportunity I looked to the work of this highly helpful Texas Consumer Association NGO that explains the massive windfall key industry players made during the freeze . Energy Transfer posted its highest quarterly net income on record more than three times its previous best quarter . $ ET made a killing off Winter Storm Uri in 2021 thanks to a massive energy storage and logistics network of assets that was primed to capitalize on market dislocations from the crisis . Just look at their CEO I am sure glad to be on his side of the table on these energy deals . I am betting on a repeat of the 2021 bonanza over this weekend hence the yolo . Disclosures I am not_a financial professional my own findings and financial decisions were made based on AI slop and trust me bro twitter research and should not_be the basis for anyone elses decisions ."
