I looked at Target (TGT) and it's way down from the past 5 years, currently pays 5% dividend, which has not been cut in the past 50 years which makes it a dividend aristocrat. It also has a 11 P/E Ratio currently from being over-sold and political drama the past few years. But I'm looking for more companies like that to checkout as well, if anyone has any pointers.",

I spotted their prospectus on moomoo and after some due diligence, it seems like this IPO could be a stock worth holding at the end of 2025. A few quick points about the IPO: \\- Financials: Over 50 years of net sales growth, strong cash flow, and nearly 10% sales growth from 2024 to 2025 \\- Industry: Healthcare supplies is a pretty mature sector, not super cyclical \\- Institutional backing: Big institutions supporting it gives some confidence in the market Things to watch out for: \\- PE exit could impact the stock price \\- Growth drivers in this sector aren’t exactly high-flying Seems like it could suit someone looking for a relatively stable company with solid cash flow. Anyone else looking at this one? Haven’t seen much chatter about it. Curious if others are following this IPO too.",

      "selftext": "The number of SWFs globally has more than tripled since 2008, reaching approximately 160-170 funds, with total assets exceeding $14 trillion. The growth is driven by both developed and emerging economies seeking to leverage public funds for national benefit. The Middle East, in particular, remains an epicenter of activity, with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) funds driving significant global investment in future-focused sectors like AI and technology. Significant growth in the Middle East (GCC) and emerging Asian nations, and recent launches in Africa (Botswana, DRC, Nigeria), making SWFs a major force in global capital markets. The largest European sovereign wealth fund, and indeed the world's largest, is Norway's Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), often called the \"Oil Fund,\" managing nearly $1.8 trillion in global assets. **Key Trends & New Entrants:** * **Africa's Rise:** New funds launched in late 2024/2025 in Botswana, DRC, Eswatini, Kenya, and Nigeria (Oyo State), with Africa's total state-owned assets nearing $1 trillion. * **Asia's Expansion:** Indonesia's <Indonesia Investment Authority (INA) is a prime example, attracting major SWF partners like China's Silk Road Fund for infrastructure. * **Middle East (GCC) Powerhouse:** Funds from UAE, Saudi Arabia (PIF), Qatar, and Kuwait are dominating global deals, investing heavily in tech, AI, and renewables, shifting investments from West to East. * **US Interest:** The US is exploring establishing its own SWF as a strategic tool, showing broader adoption of the model.",

And I'm looking at buying stocks- in this market feels fake Anything with a PE ratio above 10 is mathematically a meme coin - essentially when you buy stocks with PE ratios like that most of your money is going towards a narrative not the actual company itself And I want to buy index funds - but most of them are carried by the seven biggest tech companies All the stocks seem fake The dollar seems fake And Bitcoin is about to enter a death spiral and has multiple check engine lights outside of its price that people are not aware of because most people don't know how Bitcoin works....

I’m trying to understand what the market is pricing in for the next 12–36 months. Context I remember: • OKTA fell hard from prior highs to the 70s/60s in 2022. • Security-related headlines + weak/incomplete messaging seemed to wreck confidence. • Auth0 (~$6.5B) was widely viewed as an overpay and the synergy story felt slow. The pattern: 1. OKTA reports 2. Beats estimates 3. Stock pops 4. Then fades under $100 5. Drifts back into the 80s Feels like a trust/narrative discount more than just fundamentals. My key questions: • What’s the real bear case today? • Is Microsoft bundle risk the main overhang? • Is Auth0 still a drag or turning into an asset? • Why do CRWD/Zscaler get premium multiples while OKTA can’t hold $100+? • What would trigger a durable re-rate to $120–$150+?",

      "selftext": "[ Morningstar has updated their coverage on Nvidia Corp, after he company received a significant policy win after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the company will be permitted to resume selling its H200 AI accelerators, a roughly two-year-old generation of AI GPUs into the Chinese market. Although the U.S. government will impose a 25% revenue cut on Nvidia’s China H200 sales, higher than the previously discussed 15%, Morningstar sees this as an important step toward rebuilding Nvidia’s China AI business. Morningstar emphasizes that this development helps establish a clearer path for future revenue growth from China, a market that contributed meaningfully to Nvidia’s data-center GPU sales prior to U.S. export restrictions. However, the firm cautions that policy uncertainty remains high, and future reversals or additional restrictions cannot be ruled out. At the same time, Morningstar notes that China’s government has recently encouraged domestic AI developers to shift away from Nvidia components in favor of local alternatives. As a result, the H200’s adoption in China is not guaranteed, despite its superior performance compared with the lower-end H20 model previously approved for sale. Still, Trump’s statement that President Xi “responded positively” suggests that some level of cooperation may help Nvidia regain traction in the region. Despite the geopolitical back-and-forth, Morningstar is maintaining its $240 fair value estimate for wide-moat Nvidia, arguing that the shares remain undervalued relative to long-term fundamentals. Morningstar sees the recent selloff in AI-driven stocks as a buying opportunity for investors who can tolerate volatility. The research firm continues to assign certain aspects in the sector with uncertainty, reflecting the numerous variables influencing the company’s future, such ad U.S.-China policy tensions, global AI chip demand, competitive dynamics, and technological progress in large language models and hyperscale infrastructure. Morningstar specifically highlights the strength of Google’s Gemini AI model, which leverages Google’s in-house silicon, as a competitive risk that could affect Nvidia’s dominance in AI accelerators over time. Overall, Morningstar views the U.S. approval for H200 China sales as a positive but measured step for Nvidia, acknowledging both the revenue upside and the geopolitical risks that continue to shape the firm’s long-term outlook.",

      "selftext": "Lately, the U.S. government has shown signs of easing restrictions on exporting high end AI chips to China. According to multiple media reports, the Trump administration has decided to allow NVDA to export its H200 chips to China, but under the condition that 25% of the revenue is taken as a fee. From a market perspective, if the H200 can legally be sold in China, it could be a major step for NVDA to regain access to the world’s largest AI market ， especially since export restrictions had previously caused its market share in China to drop to almost zero. And compared to the earlier H20 chip sold to China, the H200 is a big upgrade. However, even though it’s been approved, there are still a lot of uncertainties ，whether China will allow large scale purchases, whether there will be additional reviews, and whether concerns over security and domestic technology independence will lead to procurement limits. There are even reports suggesting that China may impose extra procedures or restrictions on H200 purchases. I believe global AI demand is still booming and NVDA long term fundamentals remain strong. But with China rapidly pushing for its own AI chip development, will the H200 still be welcomed by the market there? And could this be a good setup opportunity for NVDA and other U.S. chip stocks?",

Between 10-Qs, earnings releases, and transcripts, a huge portion of what I was reading was repeated legal language or filler that did not affect valuation or price action. So I built a simple personal workflow that only focuses on what actually changes quarter to quarter: * Revenue growth trends (QoQ and YoY, not just beats or misses) * Margin direction * Forward guidance tone shifts * New or expanded risk language * What management avoids answering on the call Once I started filtering earnings this way, I went from spending over an hour per company to about 10–15 minutes, and my reactions to “headline beats” vs real strength changed completely. Curious how other long-term investors here approach earnings. What’s the first thing *you* look for when a company reports?",

Between 10Qs earnings releases and transcripts a huge portion of what I was reading was repeated legal language or filler that did not_affect valuation or price action . So I built a simple personal workflow that only focuses on what actually changes quarter to quarter Revenue growth trends QoQ and YoY not_just beats or misses Margin direction Forward guidance tone shifts New or expanded risk language What management avoids answering on the call Once I started filtering earnings this way I went from spending over an hour per company to about 10–15 minutes and my reactions to “ headline beats ” vs real strength changed completely . Curious how other longterm investors here approach earnings . What ’ s the first thing you look for when a company reports"

      "selftext": "There's been a lot of talk lately about the Fed potentially cutting rates, but with the way things are going, I’m not so sure we’ll see that anytime soon. The economy’s holding up, but tech stocks, especially the high-valuation ones, are facing some serious pressure One big factor is the rise in job openings. More job vacancies are pushing up labor costs, which could hit companies that rely on high-paid talent the hardest. This is a problem for tech stocks, especially in a higher-rate environment where margins are already getting squeezed The other issue is wage inflation. When there’s a shortage of workers, businesses have to pay more to attract and keep talent, which can lead to rising prices across the board. And if that happens, inflation could start ticking up again. If job vacancies keep climbing, the Fed might have no choice but to delay rate cuts or even keep tightening until inflation is under control. It’s clear that they’re focused on inflation, and strong demand in the labor market is a big concern for them. So, I m curious how are you all thinking about this? Are you still bullish on tech, or are you adjusting your strategy given the pressure from higher labor costs and the Fed’s stance?",

      "selftext": "Hey 25M here. In 2024 i finished university and started, I started working as a mechanical engineer. With that i began investing and learning all about it this year. I opted for VUAA. I do roughly €200 a month, i recently did a large sump investment too. I am also looking into doing a small percentage into SXRT. Thats my main investments into the future. I am planning to keep around €6-7k as emergency fund in my bank and i have about another €7k I want to put into some sort of fund to at least cover 4% inflation. I looked into my bank and a normal savings account has 0.8-1.3% and they also have investment savings account. But with fees that amounts to about 2.7% and i cant touch the money for 12 months minimum. There are various other fees they also do. This doesn't seem viable for me. Also government bonds aren't available/worth it. I am learning and looking into MMFs, bond ETFs etc. People have recommended XEON, which gives around 2.3%. I am also looking to varioud Bond ETFs. For example ERNX. Which is about 2.6% However, i am looking for recommendations from people on what I could possibly do to get around 4% and attempt to cover inflation. I don't mind learning and managing various things or doing something more complicated to set it up. Open to all suggestions. I am based in Europe, Slovakia.",

I am planning to keep around €67k as emergency fund in my bank and i have about another €7k I want to put into some sort of fund to at least cover 4 % inflation . I looked into my bank and a normal savings account has 0.81.3 % and they also have investment savings account . But with fees that amounts to about 2.7 % and i cant touch the money for 12 months minimum . There are various other fees they also do . This doesnt seem viable for me . Also government bonds arent availableworth it . I am learning and looking into MMFs bond ETFs etc . People have recommended XEON which gives around 2.3 % . I am also looking to varioud Bond ETFs . For example ERNX . Which is about 2.6 % However i am looking for recommendations from people on what I could possibly do to get around 4 % and attempt to cover inflation . I dont mind learning and managing various things or doing something more complicated to set it up . Open to all suggestions . I am based in Europe Slovakia ."

      "title": "Figure Technologies is positioned to pioneer the modernization of traditional finance infrastructure with a bridge to digital assets",
      "selftext": "Figure Technologies mission is to build the future of capital markets using its L1 Provenance Blockchain and believes it can remove intermediaries to achieve pareto markets (i.e. lenders and borrowers are connected directly via blockchain without banks, clearinghouses, and brokers collecting rent on each transaction). The company IPO'd earlier this year at $25 per share behind their mortgage / HELOC platform, which promises “a better mortgage done on blockchain”. A mortgage done with Figure costs an avg of $730 and takes a median of 10 days to close, compared to industry avg mortgage costs $11.2K and 42 days to close. Figure can offer HELOC approvals in as little as five minutes and funding in as few as five days, and its platform automates 89% of loans from application through underwriting (i.e. borrower doesn’t need to talk to a human). Figure facilitated $6 billion of home equity lending on its platform in the past 12 months, up 29% from the prior year. For comparison, I am seeing JPM Chase originated \\~$38.2 billion and BoA originated \\~$29 billion, while leaders United Wholesale originated \\~$140 Billion in loans in 2024, and Rocket Mortgage \\~$100 Billion (publicly available sources). The point here is FIGR has some traction, but are not main-stream yet. Figure sees an $80 billion revenue opportunity for its Loan Origination and Distribution marketplace - based on $2 trillion of annual consumer loan origination estimate and 4% take rate. **Carvana analogy illustrates FIGR potential** If FIGR’s process works as well as they say it does, which so far it seems to, it is an unbelievably better and more accessible experience for every consumer – especially as people become increasingly more digital. Figure’s platform creates process efficiencies to digitize and automate the manual and paper-driven mortgage and lending process in a similar way to what Carvana (added to S&P 500 this month) did for the secondary auto market. If anyone has sold a used car on through Carvana vs a dealer, you know what I'm talking about. FIGR started with mortgages and HELOC’s, but are positioned to bring tokenized real-world assets and securities to the main stream. And unlike Carvana, FIGR maintains a capital light business model that decouples loan origination from balance sheet retention (i.e. it offers mortgage and HELOC loans and a marketplace to transact those securitized loans) – as of 9/30/2025 FIGR’s balance sheet shows $389 million in loans held for sale and facilitated $2.4 billion in quarterly HELOC originations. **FIGR had an excellent first earnings call as a public company** Highlights include 42% YoY revenue growth, 82% gross margin, and $2.5 billion in loan volume for the quarter +70% YoY and the company reported that HELOC lending volumes tripled YoY. FIGR also expanded its partner network to 246 entities, up from 168 in the S1 (as of 6/30/2025). The company also announced a first-of-its-kind the launch of a blockchain-native equity share class on the Provenance blockchain – basically an ICO for real equity shares. This has never been done before. **Traditional finance in the US needs blockchain to modernize** I am generally bullish on blockchain, stablecoins, and tokenized RWA becoming a part of traditional finance because it is unbelievable that in the US we operate on a payments and securities trading infrastructure that was built in the 70’s, and we still use physical paper throughout the mortgage and lending process (deeds and “wet ink” requirements). Today's regulatory environment makes now a great time to make progress here. Interchange fees are way too high and there are probably far too many intermediaries in traditional finance processes (i.e. they are unnecessarily complex and expensive). These processes are begging to be disrupted. Traditional finance has also been granted the greatest regulatory tailwinds in history through the current white house administration, so if blockchain is going to work, we should see some of the biggest progress as regulation and rules of the game are developed. **Conclusion** Figure, under Mike Cagney’s and Michael Tannenbaum’s leadership, are positioned well to be one of the [MAG 7]( to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance through both tokenizing real-world assets and securities as well as stablecoin. If you believe that Blockchain technology can upgrade capital markets and payments infrastructure in the US, FIGR seems to be positioned as one of the first to make this happen. Curious if anyone else has thoughts about FIGR or other plays bridging traditional finance and digital assets / blockchain! Not Investment Advice. All opinions are my own. I am long FIGR.",

      "selftext_processed": "Figure Technologies mission is to build the future of capital markets using its L1 Provenance Blockchain and believes it can remove intermediaries to achieve pareto markets i.e . lenders and borrowers are connected directly via blockchain without banks clearinghouses and brokers collecting rent on each transaction . The company IPOd earlier this year at $ 25 per share behind their mortgage HELOC platform which promises “ a better mortgage done on blockchain ” . A mortgage done with Figure costs an avg of $ 730 and takes a median of 10 days to close compared to industry avg mortgage costs $ 11.2K and 42 days to close . Figure can offer HELOC approvals in as little as five minutes and funding in as few as five days and its platform automates 89 % of loans from application through underwriting i.e . borrower doesn ’ t need to talk to a human . Figure facilitated $ 6 billion of home equity lending on its platform in the past 12 months up 29 % from the prior year . For comparison I am seeing JPM Chase originated $ 38.2 billion and BoA originated $ 29 billion while leaders United Wholesale originated $ 140 Billion in loans in 2024 and Rocket Mortgage $ 100 Billion publicly available sources . The point here is FIGR has some traction but are not_mainstream yet . Figure sees an $ 80 billion revenue opportunity for its Loan Origination and Distribution marketplace based on $ 2 trillion of annual consumer loan origination estimate and 4 % take rate . Carvana analogy illustrates FIGR potential If FIGR ’ s process works as well as they say it does which so far it seems to it is an unbelievably better and more accessible experience for every consumer – especially as people become increasingly more digital . Figure ’ s platform creates process efficiencies to digitize and automate the manual and paperdriven mortgage and lending process in a similar way to what Carvana added to SP 500 this month did for the secondary auto market . If anyone has sold a used car on through Carvana vs a dealer you know what Im talking about . FIGR started with mortgages and HELOC ’ s but are positioned to bring tokenized realworld assets and securities to the main stream . And unlike Carvana FIGR maintains a capital light business model that decouples loan origination from balance sheet retention i.e . it offers mortgage and HELOC loans and a marketplace to transact those securitized loans – as of 9302025 FIGR ’ s balance sheet shows $ 389 million in loans held for sale and facilitated $ 2.4 billion in quarterly HELOC originations . FIGR had an excellent first earnings call as a public company Highlights include 42 % YoY revenue growth 82 % gross margin and $ 2.5 billion in loan volume for the quarter 70 % YoY and the company reported that HELOC lending volumes tripled YoY . FIGR also expanded its partner network to 246 entities up from 168 in the S1 as of 6302025 . The company also announced a firstofitskind the launch of a blockchainnative equity share class on the Provenance blockchain – basically an ICO for real equity shares . This has never_been done before . Traditional finance in the US needs blockchain to modernize I am generally bullish on blockchain stablecoins and tokenized RWA becoming a part of traditional finance because it is unbelievable that in the US we operate on a payments and securities trading infrastructure that was built in the 70 ’ s and we still use physical paper throughout the mortgage and lending process deeds and “ wet ink ” requirements . Todays regulatory environment makes now a great time to make progress here . Interchange fees are way too high and there are probably far too many intermediaries in traditional finance processes i.e . they are unnecessarily complex and expensive . These processes are begging to be disrupted . Traditional finance has also been granted the greatest regulatory tailwinds in history through the current white house administration so if blockchain is going to work we should see some of the biggest progress as regulation and rules of the game are developed . Conclusion Figure under Mike Cagney ’ s and Michael Tannenbaum ’ s leadership are positioned well to be one of the MAG 7 to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance through both tokenizing realworld assets and securities as well as stablecoin . If you believe that Blockchain technology can upgrade capital markets and payments infrastructure in the US FIGR seems to be positioned as one of the first to make this happen . Curious if anyone else has thoughts about FIGR or other plays bridging traditional finance and digital assets blockchain Not_Investment Advice . All opinions are my own . I am long FIGR ."

      "selftext": "Recently, I’ve been stuck on one question: I’ve got a new chunk of capital coming in, and it feels like it’s time to think about picking up some stocks again. Looking back at this year, I missed a chance that really hurts ， I wanted to buy LLY, but I hesitated. Then the price just kept climbing, and I’ve regretted it ever since. The good news is, I did add to my NVIDIA position at the end of April, and that move has made my returns pretty solid this year. Now with this new capital, I’m thinking about putting it into one of two categories ，either LLY, or one of the “Mag 7” stocks. But honestly, I’m still torn about which one makes more sense at this stage, so I figured I’d throw it out here and see what you think. LLY is a long established pharma company with a strong foundation. Their core products cover diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, oncology, and more. In recent years, thanks to demand for weight-loss and metabolic/endocrine related drugs, both their earnings and market expectations have been strong. Compared to tech stocks, the healthcare sector might be less volatile. And for long term investors, if the drug pipeline remains solid and market demand continues, LLY has the potential to deliver steady growth and some defensive strength against cycles. For me, since I already missed out on LLY once, getting in at a reasonable price this time would give me a lot more peace of mind about future returns. So I want to ask if it were you, what kind of entry price would you look for? Also, since I already hold NVDA, adding a different name could further diversify risk, instead of placing all my hope on a single company. I keep thinking if it were you, which would you choose? For me, this allocation might be a key decision, one that could influence how my portfolio performs over the next few years.",

SpaceXs management and advisers are pursuing a listing as soon as midtolate 2026 the report said citing people familiar with the matter . The timing of the IPO could change based on market conditions and other factors and one of the people said it could slip until 2027 . SpaceX did not_immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment . Media reports last week said the rocketmaker is kicking off a secondary share sale that would value it at $ 800 billion pitting it against OpenAI for the title of the most valuable private company . However Musk on Saturday dismissed the reports calling them inaccurate ."

      "selftext": "Nvidia’s recent moves keep pulling me back into the conversation because every new detail seems to reshape the picture a little. The approval to sell H200 chips to China is one of those changes that feels bigger than the headlines make it. It unlocks a huge AI market again, even though the regulatory environment around them is tightening. The stock reacting with a 2% premarket jump shows how strongly investors still believe in the long term story. Their profitability numbers back that confidence. A gross margin of 70.05% and an operating margin of 58.84% tell me Nvidia still has the kind of breathing room most companies don’t get. Even the valuation is shifting in an interesting way. The P E ratio sliding from 48.89x to 45.63x and EV EBITDA moving from 41.39x to 38.29x makes it look less stretched than before, especially for a company sitting at the center of AI growth. The insider sales are the part I’m still trying to understand. Sixteen sales in total worth around $12.26M and not a single acquisition or award in that window. The CFO alone handled 25% of the total value, and one of her sales was more than 3% times her usual size. It could be perfect timing, it could be strategic, or it could just be routine for management. But the pattern stands out, and I can’t ignore it. Analysts don’t seem worried at all. Most targets range from $220 to $320 while the stock trades around $185.55. Cantor Fitzgerald sits at $300 with a high accuracy record, Bernstein at $275, and Melius goes all the way to $320. Even online discussions around rising volume show traders expecting something to build again while other uex like bitget are still pushing their users to trade more of it to keep securing their leading uex in tokenized choice for US stock trading in the space. Still, we have John Chambers saying 2026 will be a strong year for AI which adds another layer of expectation. My question is simple. Is Nvidia setting up for its next major run or are these insider moves a quiet signal that the current price already reflects a lot of the future.",

The P E ratio sliding from 48.89x to 45.63x and EV EBITDA moving from 41.39x to 38.29x makes it look less stretched than before especially for a company sitting at the center of AI growth . The insider sales are the part I ’ m still trying to understand . Sixteen sales in total worth around $ 12.26M and not_a single acquisition or award in that window . The CFO alone handled 25 % of the total value and one of her sales was more than 3 % times her usual size . It could be perfect timing it could be strategic or it could just be routine for management . But the pattern stands out and I can ’ t ignore it . Analysts don ’ t seem worried at all . Most targets range from $ 220 to $ 320 while the stock trades around $ 185.55 . Cantor Fitzgerald sits at $ 300 with a high accuracy record Bernstein at $ 275 and Melius goes all the way to $ 320 . Even online discussions around rising volume show traders expecting something to build again while other uex like bitget are still pushing their users to trade more of it to keep securing their leading uex in tokenized choice for US stock trading in the space . Still we have John Chambers saying 2026 will be a strong year for AI which adds another layer of expectation . My question is simple . Is Nvidia setting up for its next major run or are these insider moves a quiet signal that the current price already reflects a lot of the future ."

      "selftext": "Anyone else feel like we’re walking into a weird Fed meeting this time? Everyone keeps calling it a “hawkish cut” setup which honestly sounds like an oxymoron but New York banks are basically telegraphing the same thing: “Yes, we’ll cut… but don’t get excited.” And that’s exactly the kind of messaging that usually whips the market in both directions before we get any real clarity. Here’s what’s messing with my head right now: Inflation is cooling, but not in a way that gives Powell the victory lap he wants. Labor data looks soft enough for a cut, but not soft enough for a full pivot. The bond market is acting like cuts are already guaranteed, while equities are pretending they’ve already spent the money. If we do get a hawkish cut, I’m honestly not sure which side reacts harder tech has been running on fumes, defensives are asleep, and small caps are out here fighting for their lives. My gut? Powell cuts 25bps, sounds like a disappointed dad, and the first move is the wrong move. Every FOMC lately has been a fade the initial-reaction trade. What I’m watching: Whether Powell mentions “financial conditions” tightening big clue. How the dot plot shifts for 2025 (this will decide who bleeds). If he pushes back on “multiple cuts” expectations that’s where the fireworks start. I’ve traded through a lot of these, but something about this one feels like the market is too sure of the outcome. Whenever that happens, the Fed usually smacks someone. Curious what’s everyone positioning into this? Are you hedging? Sitting in cash? Leaning into the volatility? Or just grabbing popcorn and letting algos fight it out?",

Labor data looks soft enough for a cut but not_soft enough for a full pivot . The bond market is acting like cuts are already guaranteed while equities are pretending they ’ ve already spent the money . If we do get a hawkish cut I ’ m honestly not_sure which side reacts harder tech has been running on fumes defensives are asleep and small caps are out here fighting for their lives . My gut Powell cuts 25bps sounds like a disappointed dad and the first move is the wrong move . Every FOMC lately has been a fade the initialreaction trade . What I ’ m watching Whether Powell mentions “ financial conditions ” tightening big clue . How the dot plot shifts for 2025 this will decide who bleeds . If he pushes back on “ multiple cuts ” expectations that ’ s where the fireworks start . I ’ ve traded through a lot of these but something about this one feels like the market is too sure of the outcome . Whenever that happens the Fed usually smacks someone . Curious what ’ s everyone positioning into this Are you hedging Sitting in cash Leaning into the volatility Or just grabbing popcorn and letting algos fight it out"

The fund now holds Bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana, Chainlink, Litecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Sui and Polkadot. According to Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, this makes BITW the first ETF from a major crypto asset manager to include these newer networks alongside the large-cap names. The move slightly broadens exposure beyond just the biggest and most established assets, though the fund is still heavily weighted toward Bitcoin and ether. It’ll be interesting to see whether this diversification actually improves long-term risk-adjusted returns, or if it just adds more volatility to an already volatile product. Source:",

      "selftext": "Hey, so if you don't know, I post more a lot in the daily threads over at r/stocks. I do like to write from time to time and have written a few posts in the past. One was around what I have learned along the years of investing, with like how I screen and how I research things. My approach is kind of a blend of Lynch and Buffet, where I'm a GARPy style investor. I don't mind paying fair price for something, like Buffet would say \"**It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price\".** So when I screen, I like to look for companies with a PEG under 2 and have high ROIC with growing revenues. More than happy to share my screener as well. I think a big part of becoming a successful investor is having to research. I actually enjoy doing this, since this can basically be a free hobby. You get to learn more about the world around you, plus just different industries. I also feel like this is one area you can do well, is finding some under the radar names that have little no analyst coverage. Below are some stocks I just find interesting, Doesn't mean you should go out and buy these names, but rather just highlighting some companies you probably have never heard of and just to bring up for the sake of discussion. So here are those companies: **BK Technologies Corp** [ Smaller company, but fundamentals are pretty solid. I have a thing for small float companies with good or high insider ownership. This company fits that, with only 2.97M shares available on the float with 13% insider ownership. Also has like no debt. Really strong numbers the last 4 quarters with revenue growth not being that great, but with gross margins and operating margins really improving as well as ROIC is looking really strong. [ Basically the company makes two way land mobile radios. They basically sell to all the federal agencies and have strong connections with them. Part of the story is the company outsourcing manufacturing which has led them to have less inventory, better margins and improved their working capital. Latest investor presentation: [ **Synchrony Financial** [ Much larger market cap here, with this one being 28B. Overall, it's a pretty cheap valuation for the company with the forward and trailing PE both at 8, with a PEG at 0.56. This company basically does financing and branded credit cards for retailers, making them more of a niche play. This one is a basically really boring compounder that has the risks of all credit names, but just offers a really cheap valuation. Latest quarter presentation: [ **Brainsway Ltd - ADR** This one is way more speculative of a name and not cheap, but the PEG is still about 1.04, since the EPS growth has been great. [ ROIC is a bit lower, but the company is what new to being profitable, but still seeing double digits revenue growth since Sep 2023. It has been a bit more normalized the past four quarters, around 27% growth QoQ. Another name is little debt, around 6.75M, but has 70M in cash & cash equivalents. Overall, I just find this company really interesting, what they do almost sounds fake. It offers Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation platform technology for the treatment of major depressive disorders, anxious depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, smoking addiction, bipolar disorders, post traumatic stress disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, post stroke rehabilitation, and Parkinson’s diseases. This is all FDA approved as well. Their latest investor presentation: [ **Flotek Industries Inc** Just opened a position in them this morning. They've been on my screener for a bit, but never looked into them. I tend to stay away from oil & gas names, really just own like one name in the space, FTI (which is another fun company) Valuation isn't too bad by any means: [ What is wild about this company, is the explosive growth they are seeing because they are basically going all into their data analytics side of things. Kind's of wild how much this has changed up the companies growth. Gross margins went from like 18.3% in Sep 2024 to 31.7% Sept 2025. Same thing happened with operating margins, going from 5.5% to 16.5% that same time period. ROIC is also looking great and the EPS growth is really impressive. [",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey so if you dont know I post more a lot in the daily threads over at rstocks . I do like to write from time to time and have written a few posts in the past . One was around what I have learned along the years of investing with like how I screen and how I research things . My approach is kind of a blend of Lynch and Buffet where Im a GARPy style investor . I dont mind paying fair price for something like Buffet would say Its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price . So when I screen I like to look for companies with a PEG under 2 and have high ROIC with growing revenues . More than happy to share my screener as well . I think a big part of becoming a successful investor is having to research . I actually enjoy doing this since this can basically be a free hobby . You get to learn more about the world around you plus just different industries . I also feel like this is one area you can do well is finding some under the radar names that have little no_analyst coverage . Below are some stocks I just find interesting Doesnt mean you should go out and buy these names but rather just highlighting some companies you probably have never_heard of and just to bring up for the sake of discussion . So here are those companies BK Technologies Corp Smaller company but fundamentals are pretty solid . I have a thing for small float companies with good or high insider ownership . This company fits that with only 2.97M shares available on the float with 13 % insider ownership . Also has like no_debt . Really strong numbers the last 4 quarters with revenue growth not_being that great but with gross margins and operating margins really improving as well as ROIC is looking really strong . Basically the company makes two way land mobile radios . They basically sell to all the federal agencies and have strong connections with them . Part of the story is the company outsourcing manufacturing which has led them to have less inventory better margins and improved their working capital . Latest investor presentation Synchrony Financial Much larger market cap here with this one being 28B . Overall its a pretty cheap valuation for the company with the forward and trailing PE both at 8 with a PEG at 0.56 . This company basically does financing and branded credit cards for retailers making them more of a niche play . This one is a basically really boring compounder that has the risks of all credit names but just offers a really cheap valuation . Latest quarter presentation Brainsway Ltd ADR This one is way more speculative of a name and not_cheap but the PEG is still about 1.04 since the EPS growth has been great . ROIC is a bit lower but the company is what new to being profitable but still seeing double digits revenue growth since Sep 2023 . It has been a bit more normalized the past four quarters around 27 % growth QoQ . Another name is little debt around 6.75M but has 70M in cash cash equivalents . Overall I just find this company really interesting what they do almost sounds fake . It offers Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation platform technology for the treatment of major depressive disorders anxious depression obsessivecompulsive disorders smoking addiction bipolar disorders post traumatic stress disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer ’ s disease autism chronic pain multiple sclerosis post stroke rehabilitation and Parkinson ’ s diseases . This is all FDA approved as well . Their latest investor presentation Flotek Industries Inc Just opened a position in them this morning . Theyve been on my screener for a bit but never_looked into them . I tend to stay away from oil gas names really just own like one name in the space FTI which is another fun company Valuation isnt too bad by any means What is wild about this company is the explosive growth they are seeing because they are basically going all into their data analytics side of things . Kinds of wild how much this has changed up the companies growth . Gross margins went from like 18.3 % in Sep 2024 to 31.7 % Sept 2025 . Same thing happened with operating margins going from 5.5 % to 16.5 % that same time period . ROIC is also looking great and the EPS growth is really impressive ."

And before you say “what kid would want a stock” i also get them toys and such so that im not the worst uncle ever. The first year was Disney and i explained what a stock is, the second year was Coca Cola and i explained what a dividend is. This year, im unsure what stock to get for them and what lesson to teach so im reaching out for suggestions! Obviously would love to gift them something like aapl or amzn but its a bit out of my price range at the moment, especially because i need to buy two! Im looking for a low risk, long term hold stock between $100-$150, so far PG is in the lead but im always willing to look into others. Additionally, and more importantly, what lesson should i try to teach them? And what would be a good child like analogy i can use to really drive it home? Any advice is appreciated!",

And before you say “ what kid would want a stock ” i also get them toys and such so that im not_the worst uncle ever . The first year was Disney and i explained what a stock is the second year was Coca Cola and i explained what a dividend is . This year im unsure what stock to get for them and what lesson to teach so im reaching out for suggestions Obviously would love to gift them something like aapl or amzn but its a bit out of my price range at the moment especially because i need to buy two Im looking for a low risk long term hold stock between $ 100 $ 150 so far PG is in the lead but im always willing to look into others . Additionally and more importantly what lesson should i try to teach them And what would be a good child like analogy i can use to really drive it home Any advice is appreciated"

      "selftext": "Microsoft has confirmed it will add three new availability zones for Azure Government Cloud in Arizona by early 2026, further strengthening its presence in the U.S. public sector. Government cloud services feature stable demand, high entry barriers, and strong customer loyalty, representing a long term positive for Microsoft.

      "selftext": "I've been following Roblox (RBLX Corporation) stock recently, and I think it's a great investment opportunity. As a gaming platform, Roblox has attracted a large number of young users, especially teenagers and children; almost every kid knows it. More importantly, it's not just a game platform; it's a platform for creation and social interaction, where players can create their own games and interact with other players. This unique model makes Roblox a huge ecosystem, not just a simple entertainment platform. With its growing user base, Roblox's revenue model is also expanding, from virtual item sales to advertising and revenue sharing with game developers, all providing the company with stable income streams. Although Roblox is currently still operating at a loss, its revenue growth rate is very fast, and I believe that as user engagement increases, the losses will gradually decrease, eventually leading to profitability. What makes me even more optimistic is that with the rise of virtual reality and the metaverse concept, Roblox, as an open virtual world platform, is in a very advantageous position. In the future, the demand for virtual worlds will only increase, and Roblox itself has the capability to build such virtual worlds. For young people, Roblox is not just a gaming platform, but also a virtual social space, and I believe this trend will continue. Even more interestingly, many may not have noticed Roblox's very strong creator economy. More and more users are not only playing games, but also creating games and earning money through the platform. This \"player-creator\" model not only provides Roblox with more content, but also greatly enhances user engagement and stickiness. For me, Roblox represents far more than just a gaming platform; it's more like a promising virtual world that I believe will become a crucial part of global entertainment and social interaction in the coming years. Overall, despite the current stock price volatility, I believe in Roblox's long-term growth potential, especially its breakthroughs in the youth market and virtual reality, making it a stock worth holding for the long term. And looking at its chart, the overall structure is also in an upward trend. What do you think?",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been following Roblox RBLX Corporation stock recently and I think its a great investment opportunity . As a gaming platform Roblox has attracted a large number of young users especially teenagers and children almost every kid knows it . More importantly its not_just a game platform its a platform for creation and social interaction where players can create their own games and interact with other players . This unique model makes Roblox a huge ecosystem not_just a simple entertainment platform . With its growing user base Robloxs revenue model is also expanding from virtual item sales to advertising and revenue sharing with game developers all providing the company with stable income streams . Although Roblox is currently still operating at a loss its revenue growth rate is very fast and I believe that as user engagement increases the losses will gradually decrease eventually leading to profitability . What makes me even more optimistic is that with the rise of virtual reality and the metaverse concept Roblox as an open virtual world platform is in a very advantageous position . In the future the demand for virtual worlds will only increase and Roblox itself has the capability to build such virtual worlds . For young people Roblox is not_just a gaming platform but also a virtual social space and I believe this trend will continue . Even more interestingly many may not_have noticed Robloxs very strong creator economy . More and more users are not_only playing games but also creating games and earning money through the platform . This playercreator model not_only provides Roblox with more content but also greatly enhances user engagement and stickiness . For me Roblox represents far more than just a gaming platform its more like a promising virtual world that I believe will become a crucial part of global entertainment and social interaction in the coming years . Overall despite the current stock price volatility I believe in Robloxs longterm growth potential especially its breakthroughs in the youth market and virtual reality making it a stock worth holding for the long term . And looking at its chart the overall structure is also in an upward trend . What do you think"

Even the founder of Anthropic went to meet with India’s top officials recently. The whole vibe feels… different. To me, this news isn’t about “bullish” or “bearish.” It’s more like a reminder: the big players are already positioning themselves for what the world looks like ten years from now, while most of us are still glued to short-term charts. Do you think Microsoft is just following its usual global expansion playbook? Or is this something bigger?",

The whole vibe feels… different . To me this news isn ’ t about “ bullish ” or “ bearish. ” It ’ s more like a reminder the big players are already positioning themselves for what the world looks like ten years from now while most of us are still glued to shortterm charts .

      "selftext": "[ Dec 9 (Reuters) - Beijing is set to limit access to Nvidia's advanced H200 chips despite U.S. President Donald Trump's [decision]( to allow the export of the technology to China, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. Regulators in Beijing have been discussing ways to permit limited access to the H200, Nvidia's second-best generation of artificial intelligence chips, according to the report. Such a move would add a hurdle to Nvidia [(NVDA.O)]( [, opens new tab]( and other top U.S. chipmakers' ability to address the China market, after Trump's Monday announcement appeared to settle a debate over whether these companies should keep their global lead by selling AI chips to China or withhold shipments. Nvidia shares, which had risen as much as 2% in premarket trading, pared gains after the report and were last up about 0.6%. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report. Beijing has been [pushing back]( against domestic firms' use of U.S. technology, especially Nvidia chips, as it retaliates against American restrictions. Earlier U.S. restrictions banned the sale of advanced AI processors to China, weighing on Nvidia's ability to grow in one of the world's largest markets for AI chips and development. The export of the [H200 chips]( will be permitted with a 25% fee levied on such sales, Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Monday. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the approval alone may have limited impact on Nvidia's business in China unless it is allowed to export other chip lines such as Blackwell or Rubin. Shares of AMD and Intel also pared gains and were last up about 0.3% in premarket trading. So far this year, Nvidia has gained nearly 40% compared with the S&P 500 [(.SPX)]( [, opens new tab]( benchmark index's 16.4% rise in the same period.",

      "selftext": "Lately I’ve seen some news saying that Meta might launch a large language model called Avocado in Q1 of 2026, aiming to directly compete with companies like OpenAI and Google. As someone who follows AI and tech trends, I find this pretty interesting. Honestly, it raised a lot of questions in my head. Before this, Llama mainly took the open-source route great for the developer community, but not exactly top-tier for commercial competition. Now suddenly there’s this “Avocado,” which sounds like they’re gearing up to go head-to-head with GPT and Gemini. Meta has the biggest social data pool in the world, but they entered the commercial AI game later. If Avocado comes out and gets widely adopted, it could boost Meta’s AI capabilities, improve product competitiveness, and maybe even drive more attention and push its stock price up. For investors who like tech longterm plays, this feels like a moment worth watching and honestly, maybe a potential opportunity. What do you guys think?",

As someone who follows AI and tech trends I find this pretty interesting . Honestly it raised a lot of questions in my head . Before this Llama mainly took the opensource route great for the developer community but not_exactly toptier for commercial competition . Now suddenly there ’ s this “ Avocado ” which sounds like they ’ re gearing up to go headtohead with GPT and Gemini . Meta has the biggest social data pool in the world but they entered the commercial AI game later . If Avocado comes out and gets widely adopted it could boost Meta ’ s AI capabilities improve product competitiveness and maybe even drive more attention and push its stock price up . For investors who like tech longterm plays this feels like a moment worth watching and honestly maybe a potential opportunity . What do you guys think"

Thinking of either: (a) 60% VOO, 20% QQQM, 20% VXUS or (b) 45% VOO, 35% QQQM, 20% VXUS. After considering the various factors, my reasons for these 3 ETFs are as follows: - VOO as the backbone with the S&P 500. Although it’s the default “VOO and chill” which is a little boring, it’s relatively reliable and stable as a compounder and captures the overall strength of the US economy. - QQQM as the turbocharger for growth. Yes, VOO already has tech, but I see QQQM as a deliberate overweight into the sector which beats the broad market over the long run. I’m still on the boat that the tech sector will continue to thrive exponentially. - VXUS to capture everything non-US related. Europe, Japan, emerging markets, developed Asia. When the dollar weakens, when US valuations get too hot, when global cycles differ, VXUS is my ballast and the global hedge so I can ensure that I’m not betting my entire future on just one country.",

Thinking of either a 60 % VOO 20 % QQQM 20 % VXUS or b 45 % VOO 35 % QQQM 20 % VXUS . After considering the various factors my reasons for these 3 ETFs are as follows VOO as the backbone with the SP 500 . Although it ’ s the default “ VOO and chill ” which is a little boring it ’ s relatively reliable and stable as a compounder and captures the overall strength of the US economy . QQQM as the turbocharger for growth . Yes VOO already has tech but I see QQQM as a deliberate overweight into the sector which beats the broad market over the long run . I ’ m still on the boat that the tech sector will continue to thrive exponentially . VXUS to capture everything nonUS related . Europe Japan emerging markets developed Asia . When the dollar weakens when US valuations get too hot when global cycles differ VXUS is my ballast and the global hedge so I can ensure that I ’ m not_betting my entire future on just one country ."

The arrests are part of a wider investigation into what officials say is a network designed to bypass U.S. export controls on advanced technology. Separately, a Houston-based company and its owner have already pleaded guilty to routing Nvidia hardware through shell buyers to evade restrictions. Investigators say the broader probe now involves more than $160 million worth of export-controlled tech. It’s another reminder of how tight controls around AI and high-end chips have become, and how aggressively enforcement is picking up as demand keeps rising. Source:",

The arrests are part of a wider investigation into what officials say is a network designed to bypass U.S. export controls on advanced technology . Separately a Houstonbased company and its owner have already pleaded guilty to routing Nvidia hardware through shell buyers to evade restrictions . Investigators say the broader probe now involves more than $ 160 million worth of exportcontrolled tech . It ’ s another reminder of how tight controls around AI and highend chips have become and how aggressively enforcement is picking up as demand keeps rising . Source"

My allocation is 70/20/10 which feels right but the mental clarity from simplifying was honestly the best part, I don't spend hours reading earnings or arguing online anymore, I check everything with blossom now and my returns have been totally fine, just buying more shares monthly and ignoring the noise, nothing crazy but steady… If you're on the fence about going full bogle I'd say just do it, the peace of mind is worth more than chasing extra returns",

My allocation is 702010 which feels right but the mental clarity from simplifying was honestly the best part I dont spend hours reading earnings or arguing online anymore I check everything with blossom now and my returns have been totally fine just buying more shares monthly and ignoring the noise nothing_crazy but steady… If youre on the fence about going full bogle Id say just do it the peace of mind is worth more than chasing extra returns"

      "selftext": "Honestly, I’m getting tired of looking for value in this market with everything at ATH, so I started digging into unloved sectors. Stumbled across NICE Ltd ($NICE) and the numbers are weirdly good for a stock that’s done nothing lately. Basically, they do the backend software for contact centers (CCaaS) and financial crime prevention. Not sexy, I know. But here is the thing – they are quietly pivoting to cloud and actually making money. Their cloud revenue is growing fast and is about to flip their legacy business. Usually, when legacy tech companies pull off a cloud transition, the multiple expands, but NICE is still trading at a massive discount to pure-play cloud stocks like Salesforce or ServiceNow. I pulled the key numbers that stood out to me from their latest filings: |Metric|The Numbers|Why I think it matters| |:-|:-|:-| |**Cloud Growth**|**\\~20-22% (Guidance)**|Finally offsetting the legacy churn| |**FinCrime Margin**|**60-62%**|High-margin \"floor\" that funds the AI transition| |**Cash on Hand**|**\\~$1.5B**|Huge safety net, no bankruptcy risk here| |**Valuation**|**Discounted**|Priced like hardware, growing like SaaS| I looked deeper at their \"Actimize\" segment (the high-margin anti-money laundering stuff), and that 60%+ margin feels like a sticky floor because banks can’t just stop spending on compliance without getting fined by regulators. The bear case is obviously Amazon. Amazon Connect is eating market share and if AWS decides to burn cash to kill competitors, NICE could get squeezed. Also, they just bought Cognigy to catch up on the AI agent trend, and integration is always a coin toss. I’m thinking of opening a position because it feels like a classic GARP play that the market is ignoring because it’s \"boring\" compared to AI chips. Does anyone here have experience with their actual product? Is the moat against Amazon real or are they going to get crushed?",

      "selftext": "There's a video on Youtube titled 'What does 'wealthy' even mean in 2025?' which is a CNN channel. Here, CNN's Michael Smerconish speaks with Jean Chatzky. Mrs. Chatzky claims (time stamp 5:56 of the video) that a wealth transfer of $124T will happen from Boomers to their kids or whatever. Another thing she says is that this will increase the wealth concentration as in the rich will become even richer, and there will be fewer of those. It immediately hit me. Where will they plough that money into? A good chunk h_as to end up in S&P500 right? In other words, in the next decade, as and when these boomers pass on, S&P500 (and hence, the mag-7) should skyrocket in price right? Added to that, if these guys manage to pull it off in the AI race, these stocks are bound to skyrocket in price and could be at an inflated level (meaning high pe etc) for a while right? These two forces (AI boom, and wealth transfer of 124 freakin trillion dollars) should propel the markets a lot I'd think. It's basically an economic stimulus right? But this time, the fed is not printing the money. Your thoughts?",

Mrs. Chatzky claims time stamp 556 of the video that a wealth transfer of $ 124T will happen from Boomers to their kids or whatever . Another thing she says is that this will increase the wealth concentration as in the rich will become even richer and there will be fewer of those . It immediately hit me . Where will they plough that money into A good chunk h_as to end up in SP500 right In other words in the next decade as and when these boomers pass on SP500 and hence the mag7 should skyrocket in price right Added to that if these guys manage to pull it off in the AI race these stocks are bound to skyrocket in price and could be at an inflated level meaning high pe etc for a while right These two forces AI boom and wealth transfer of 124 freakin trillion dollars should propel the markets a lot Id think . Its basically an economic stimulus right But this time the fed is not_printing the money . Your thoughts"

      "selftext": "Source: Dec 8 (Reuters) - Warby Parker said on Monday it is collaborating with Alphabet's Google to develop lightweight AI-powered glasses, with the first product expected to launch in 2026. The announcement, made during The Android Show | XR Edition, marks the first time the companies have set a public timeline for the release since unveiling the partnership earlier this year. Google has been making a renewed push into augmented reality and wearable technology, a sector where Meta and Apple have taken early leads. Meta has poured resources into its Quest mixed-reality headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses, while Apple entered the market with its Vision Pro headset earlier this year, positioning it as a premium spatial computing device. Google, which shelved its consumer-focused Glass product nearly a decade ago, is now betting on AI integration and strategic partnerships to make smart eyewear more mainstream. The collaboration with Warby Parker will leverage Google's Android XR platform and Gemini AI model to deliver multimodal intelligence in everyday eyewear, aiming for suitable for all-day wear. Warby Parker described its upcoming glasses as \"lightweight and AI-enabled\" but did not provide details on pricing or distribution plans. In a blog post, Google said it is working with Samsung, Gentle Monster and Warby Parker to create stylish, lightweight glasses. The initiative includes two types of devices: AI glasses for screen-free assistance, equipped with speakers, microphones and cameras for natural interaction with Gemini, and display AI glasses that feature an in-lens display for private access to information such as navigation or translation captions.",

However, I have only seen one recent post saying that an \\*attempt\\* was made in civil asset forfeiture to take a person's entire brokerage account. I have had my brokerages for years and years and always thought it kept me immune to civil asset forfeiture, but this is something I do have to worry about since I have already been illegally detained by the police once since they didn't want me to call 911 or file complaints against a specific kind of people that attack others with a specific type of weapon. That same police department has harassed me over a year now. Has anyone actually lost all their stocks and cash in banks and brokerages to civil asset forfeiture based on a false charge brought on by police officers? Recently, they made an accusation at me of forcing entry to neighbors houses, and also, they heavily implied that I shouldn't be living there, but in the future, they could bring any number of bogus charges against me just to succeed in the forfeiture, and then they can drop the charges later once the brokerages comply, if they do.",

From the metrics I pulled, ISSC outperforms most peers on several fronts: • **ROIC \\~20%** • **Revenue CAGR \\~27%** • Strong margins (EBIT + gross) • Valuation still around **\\~15× earnings** So you have a company showing solid profitability and above-average growth, but priced lower than most of its peers. With their upcoming report, it’ll be interesting to see how the market reacts and whether the numbers continue to support this trend. Curious if anyone else has looked into it.",

      "title": "Carvana $CVNA is Highly Fraudulent",
      "selftext": "Credentials: 14 year automotive veteran. 15 year options trader Bullet Points: 1) Carvana’s profit margins are too good to be true. The best companies in the industry don’t come close to their 19% gross profit margins. 2) The CEO of Carvana (Ernest Garcia III) Also owns a privately owned auto business named Drivetime. Drivetime is a dumpster fire. 3) Ernest Garcia III has been funneling his unwanted Carvana inventory to Drivetime to prop up Carvana’s earnings. Drivetime overpays Carvana for this inventory and then takes the loss on their own balance sheets. 4) Over the last few months Ernest Garcia III has been selling tens of millions of dollars of stock to keep Drivetime afloat 5) Carvana has issued roughly 15.3 million shares over the last year. At average $330 price this comes to roughly 5 Billion USD. None of this reflects on the company’s financial report. Thesis: Based on CVNA October 2025 earnings report the company’s equity attributed to shareholders increased by 1B usd. In the same period the company issued ~15.3 million shares worth over 5B usd. None of this issuance reflects on the company’s balance sheets. Healthy companies issue dividends and buy back stock. Carvana has no dividend and has issued billions in stock solely to their core insiders. Drivetime (a company owned by Carvana’s CEO) has the worst inventory I have ever seen. Thousands and thousands of cars that are absolutely overpriced garbage. Some of the cars they have been sitting on for over 6 months. In October and September of 2025 Ernest Garcia III has sold roughly 82 million dollars of carvana stock. I am not a private investigator, financial pro, or accountant, but to me the evidence is compelling that carvana’s results are being directly propped by DRIVETIME and once the Garcias have enriched themselves the real results will emerge. I plan to open short positions against CVNA in the next few weeks after they fully transition to the SP 500",

      "title": "Nvidia Gets Regulatory Approval: China Market Back Open for H200",
      "selftext": "The U.S. Commerce Department will allow Nvidia to export its advanced H200 artificial intelligence accelerators to China, according to a report from Semafor, marking one of the most notable shifts in U.S. semiconductor export policy in more than a year. The decision partially rolls back restrictions that had previously barred shipments of Nvidia’s A100, H100, and H200-class GPUs to Chinese customers over national security concerns. Under the revised rules, Nvidia may resume sales of the H200 so long as exported configurations fall within newly defined performance limits and comply with enhanced government monitoring. The adjustment follows weeks of uncertainty, during which Nvidia executives repeatedly emphasized that final export approval would ultimately come from President Trump. China represents 20 to 25% of Nvidia’s data-center revenue. Restoring access even partially could meaningfully lift 2026 sales guidance.",

The decision partially rolls back restrictions that had previously barred shipments of Nvidia ’ s A100 H100 and H200class GPUs to Chinese customers over national security concerns . Under the revised rules Nvidia may resume sales of the H200 so long as exported configurations fall within newly defined performance limits and comply with enhanced government monitoring . The adjustment follows weeks of uncertainty during which Nvidia executives repeatedly emphasized that final export approval would ultimately come from President Trump . China represents 20 to 25 % of Nvidia ’ s datacenter revenue . Restoring access even partially could meaningfully lift 2026 sales guidance ."

      "selftext": "Okay so this is getting spicy. We officially have a bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery and I genuinely don't know who wins here. Want to hear what you all think. # Quick background **Friday (Dec 5):** [Netflix announced a deal to buy WBD's studio and streaming assets]( for $72B ($27.75/share). This gets them HBO Max, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC Universe, The Sopranos, etc. Basically [100 years of Warner Bros content]( \\- 6,650 films, 50,000 TV titles. **Monday (Dec 8):** [Paramount Skydance launches hostile bid]( at $30/share all-cash ($108.4B enterprise value). David Ellison going directly to shareholders, bypassing the WBD board. The premium Paramount is offering? **$17.6 billion more** than Netflix's deal. # The money behind each bid **Netflix ($72B):** * Cash + stock deal * $5.8B breakup fee if regulators block it * Would combine #1 streamer (Netflix) with #3 (HBO Max) **Paramount Skydance ($108.4B):** * All cash, $30/share * Backed by [$40.7B from Larry Ellison]( (David's dad, Oracle co-founder) * Plus funding from Saudi, Qatar, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds * And Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners * [Bank of America, Citi, Apollo committed $54B in debt]( # The bull case for Netflix winning 1. **Synergies are insane.** They have [200M non-HBO Max subscribers globally]( who could be cross-sold HBO content. Revenue synergy is real. 2. **Bank of America literally said \"the throne is secured\"** on Dec 7. They see Netflix as the streaming endgame. 3. **They already have a signed deal.** WBD board approved it. Paramount has to convince shareholders to reject a bird in hand. 4. **Content integration is cleaner.** Netflix knows streaming. Paramount is still figuring out Paramount+ after the Skydance merger in August. # The bull case for Paramount winning 1. **$17.6 billion more cash.** Money talks. Shareholders might prefer certainty of all-cash vs Netflix's stock component. 2. **The Trump card (literally).** [Ellison told CNBC]( that Trump \"believes in competition\" and combining Paramount + WBD creates \"a real competitor to Netflix, a real competitor to Amazon.\" And here's what nobody's talking about: [Larry Ellison (David's dad) is basically Trump's closest tech ally]( He hosted a six-figure-per-person Trump fundraiser in 2020, [dines with Trump at Mar-a-Lago regularly]( and [dropped $450M on real estate 20 minutes from Mar-a-Lago]( When asked about TikTok, Trump literally said [\"I'd love for Larry to do it.\"]( Oracle got the Stargate AI deal. Some analysts say [Larry is more influential with Trump than Elon]( If this WBD deal needs regulatory approval from the Trump admin... who do you think has the edge? 3. **Antitrust concerns for Netflix are real.** Combining #1 and #3 streamers? [Elizabeth Warren already called it \"an anti-monopoly nightmare.\"]( Writers Guild wants it blocked. 4. **Paramount wants the WHOLE thing.** Netflix is only buying studios + streaming. [Paramount bid for the entire company]( including CNN, TNT Sports, etc. # What the market is saying * [WBD up 5% to $27]( (above Netflix's $27.75 offer, betting on bidding war) * PSKY up 7% * NFLX down 3% Market seems to think either Netflix raises or Paramount wins. # The regulatory wildcard Netflix agreed to pay [$5.8B breakup fee if blocked]( That's how real the antitrust risk is. If WBD chooses Paramount instead, they owe Netflix a $2.8B breakup fee. Not nothing. Ellison's argument: Paramount is smaller, less antitrust concern, faster close. Counter-argument: Paramount just closed the Skydance merger in August. Adding WBD on top? That's a LOT of integration. # My take (worth nothing) I genuinely don't know. The Netflix deal makes strategic sense - they get Harry Potter, DC, HBO originals, and crush the streaming wars permanently. But $17.6B is $17.6B and shareholders might want the cash. The Trump/Ellison relationship is the X factor nobody's pricing correctly imo. # Vote time - who wins? 1. **Netflix** \\- board-approved deal holds, synergies too good, Paramount's bid is desperate 2. **Paramount Skydance** \\- cash is king, regulatory path clearer, Trump admin approves faster 3. **Netflix raises bid** \\- this becomes a $90B+ deal 4. **Neither** \\- regulators block everything and WBD stays independent Drop your vote and reasoning. Especially curious what the media/entertainment folks here think about the content library value. *no position in any of these names, just fascinated by the biggest media deal since... ever?*",

Adding WBD on top Thats a LOT of integration . My take worth nothing_I genuinely dont know . The Netflix deal makes strategic sense they get Harry Potter DC HBO originals and crush the streaming wars permanently . But $ 17.6B is $ 17.6B and shareholders might want the cash .

      "selftext": "Okay so this is getting spicy. We officially have a bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery and I genuinely don't know who wins here. Want to hear what you all think. ## Quick background **Friday (Dec 5):** [Netflix announced a deal to buy WBD's studio and streaming assets]( for $72B ($27.75/share). This gets them HBO Max, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC Universe, The Sopranos, etc. Basically [100 years of Warner Bros content]( - 6,650 films, 50,000 TV titles. **Monday (Dec 8):** [Paramount Skydance launches hostile bid]( at $30/share all-cash ($108.4B enterprise value). David Ellison going directly to shareholders, bypassing the WBD board. The premium Paramount is offering? **$17.6 billion more** than Netflix's deal. ## The money behind each bid **Netflix ($72B):** - Cash + stock deal - $5.8B breakup fee if regulators block it - Would combine #1 streamer (Netflix) with #3 (HBO Max) **Paramount Skydance ($108.4B):** - All cash, $30/share - Backed by [$40.7B from Larry Ellison]( (David's dad, Oracle co-founder) - Plus funding from Saudi, Qatar, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds - And Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners - [Bank of America, Citi, Apollo committed $54B in debt]( ## The bull case for Netflix winning 1. **Synergies are insane.** They have [200M non-HBO Max subscribers globally]( who could be cross-sold HBO content. Revenue synergy is real. 2. **Bank of America literally said \"the throne is secured\"** on Dec 7. They see Netflix as the streaming endgame. 3. **They already have a signed deal.** WBD board approved it.

Paramount is still figuring out Paramount+ after the Skydance merger in August. ## The bull case for Paramount winning 1. **$17.6 billion more cash.** Money talks. Shareholders might prefer certainty of all-cash vs Netflix's stock component. 2. **The Trump card (literally).** [Ellison told CNBC]( that Trump \"believes in competition\" and combining Paramount + WBD creates \"a real competitor to Netflix, a real competitor to Amazon.\" And here's what nobody's talking about: [Larry Ellison (David's dad) is basically Trump's closest tech ally]( He hosted a six-figure-per-person Trump fundraiser in 2020, [dines with Trump at Mar-a-Lago regularly]( and [dropped $450M on real estate 20 minutes from Mar-a-Lago]( When asked about TikTok, Trump literally said [\"I'd love for Larry to do it.\"]( Oracle got the Stargate AI deal.

[Elizabeth Warren already called it \"an anti-monopoly nightmare.\"]( Writers Guild wants it blocked. 4. **Paramount wants the WHOLE thing.** Netflix is only buying studios + streaming.

      "selftext_processed": "Okay so this is getting spicy . We officially have a bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery and I genuinely dont know who wins here . Want to hear what you all think . Quick background Friday Dec 5 Netflix announced a deal to buy WBDs studio and streaming assets for $ 72B $ 27.75share . This gets them HBO Max Harry Potter Game of Thrones DC Universe The Sopranos etc . Basically 100 years of Warner Bros content 6650 films 50000 TV titles . Monday Dec 8 Paramount Skydance launches hostile bid at $ 30share allcash $ 108.4B enterprise value . David Ellison going directly to shareholders bypassing the WBD board . The premium Paramount is offering $ 17.6 billion more than Netflixs deal . The money behind each bid Netflix $ 72B Cash stock deal $ 5.8B breakup fee if regulators block it Would combine 1 streamer Netflix with 3 HBO Max Paramount Skydance $ 108.4B All cash $ 30share Backed by $ 40.7B from Larry Ellison Davids dad Oracle cofounder Plus funding from Saudi Qatar Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds And Jared Kushners Affinity Partners Bank of America Citi Apollo committed $ 54B in debt The bull case for Netflix winning 1 . Synergies are insane . They have 200M nonHBO Max subscribers globally who could be crosssold HBO content . Revenue synergy is real . 2 . Bank of America literally said the throne is secured on Dec 7 . They see Netflix as the streaming endgame . 3 . They already have a signed deal . WBD board approved it . Paramount has to convince shareholders to reject a bird in hand . 4 . Content integration is cleaner . Netflix knows streaming . Paramount is still figuring out Paramount after the Skydance merger in August . The bull case for Paramount winning 1 . $ 17.6 billion more cash . Money talks . Shareholders might prefer certainty of allcash vs Netflixs stock component . 2 . The Trump card literally . Ellison told CNBC that Trump believes in competition and combining Paramount WBD creates a real competitor to Netflix a real competitor to Amazon . And heres what nobodys_talking about Larry Ellison Davids dad is basically Trumps closest tech ally He hosted a sixfigureperperson Trump fundraiser in 2020 dines with Trump at MaraLago regularly and dropped $ 450M on real estate 20 minutes from MaraLago When asked about TikTok Trump literally said Id love for Larry to do it . Oracle got the Stargate AI deal . Some analysts say Larry is more influential with Trump than Elon If this WBD deal needs regulatory approval from the Trump admin ... who do you think has the edge 3 . Antitrust concerns for Netflix are real . Combining 1 and 3 streamers Elizabeth Warren already called it an antimonopoly nightmare . Writers Guild wants it blocked . 4 . Paramount wants the WHOLE thing . Netflix is only buying studios streaming . Paramount bid for the entire company including CNN TNT Sports etc . What the market is saying WBD up 5 % to $ 27 above Netflixs $ 27.75 offer betting on bidding war PSKY up 7 % NFLX down 3 % Market seems to think either Netflix raises or Paramount wins . The regulatory wildcard Netflix agreed to pay $ 5.8B breakup fee if blocked Thats how real the antitrust risk is . If WBD chooses Paramount instead they owe Netflix a $ 2.8B breakup fee . Not_nothing . Ellisons argument Paramount is smaller less antitrust concern faster close . Counterargument Paramount just closed the Skydance merger in August . Adding WBD on top Thats a LOT of integration . My take worth nothing_I genuinely dont know . The Netflix deal makes strategic sense they get Harry Potter DC HBO originals and crush the streaming wars permanently . But $ 17.6B is $ 17.6B and shareholders might want the cash . The TrumpEllison relationship is the X factor nobodys_pricing correctly imo . Vote time who wins 1 . Netflix boardapproved deal holds synergies too good Paramounts bid is desperate 2 . Paramount Skydance cash is king regulatory path clearer Trump admin approves faster 3 . Netflix raises bid this becomes a $ 90B deal 4 . Neither regulators block everything and WBD stays independent Drop your vote and reasoning . Especially curious what the mediaentertainment folks here think about the content library value . no position in any of these names just fascinated by the biggest media deal since ... ever"

In July it peaked at around 17 due to Wilds (I think), it's currently sitting at 11.8. I sold at around 13.7 and now got back in at this price. I've made solid returns over the years doing this. Yeah it's not flashy but does the work for me.",

      "title": "📓 The Pick-and-Shovel, Double-Digit Growth Space Play You Haven’t Heard Of",
      "selftext": "# TL;DR Here’s the whole thesis: If you believe space launches will increase; if you expect NASA, commercial satellite operators, national-security agencies, and private launch companies will keep expanding activity into orbit, then Karman is a little-known company you *need* to know. ================================= # The Short & Sweet Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is a little-known **aerospace and defense** company posting numbers that look nothing like the obscurity of its stock. Revenue up 23% YoY, net income up 191%, and a funded backlog up 35%, with guidance calling for another year *(and beyond)* of **double-digit expansion**. For a company most of you haven’t even heard of, these are eye-popping metrics. The driver is straightforward: Karman builds high-spec structures, subsystems, and assemblies for **missiles, hypersonics, and next-gen launch vehicles**. Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–high-temperature alloys, for materials used in **strategic missile programs** where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive. That move pushed Karman deeper into **classified supply chains** tied to U.S. rearmament, allied purchases, and the global shift toward tactical missile systems. Karman also sits inside both of the next-decade launch platforms: **Blue Origin’s New Glenn and ULA’s Vulcan**. Each is designed for national security, deep-space, and commercial missions. And since Karman supplies structural components to *both* vehicles, you don’t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst. **Karman wins either way**. Karman’s core markets (missile defense, hypersonics, and launch systems) are expanding, not contracting. That makes its recent pullback attractive. **Takeaway:** Karman is a rare case of a true hidden gem. The company sits inside every major missile and launch trend, and that trend will just accelerate. ================================= # The Long & Winding Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is an under-the-radar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. **space and missile-defense programs**. But before we talk about what this company actually *does*, we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings. After all, **numbers don’t care about narratives**. They don’t hype. They simply record the truth, especially the kind most people don't pay attention to. Karman’s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual. A company whose trajectory doesn’t match its obscurity. **Growth hiding behind small-cap camouflage**. # The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small, the numbers don’t lie. They signal momentum. And momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental. # FY2024: A Record Across the Board On April 8, 2025, KRMN reported: * **Revenue**: $345.3M, **+23% YoY** * **Net income**: $12.7M, **+191.3% YoY** * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $106.1M, **+29.7% YoY** * **Funded backlog**: $579.8M, **+35.2% YoY** For a small-cap contractor, these are not ordinary numbers. This is a company stepping into a larger orbit. # 2025 Outlook: Expansion, Not Consolidation For FY2025, Karman expects: * **Revenue**: $423–$433M * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $132–$137M **Double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth**. # Q1 2025: The Trend Continued On May 13, 2025: * **EPS**: $0.05 (vs. $0.02 est.) * **Revenue**: $100.12M, **+20.6% YoY** Guidance reaffirmed. No slowdown. At this point, some of you might realize that even though you’ve never heard of this company, these numbers look interesting. And they are. Because once you peel back the veil, the reason becomes obvious. # The CEO Speaks After delivering the [Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025]( Tony Koblinski, Karman’s Chief Executive Officer, summarized it this way: >“Across numerous key metrics, we achieved record performance in 2024 that positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond. >Each of our end markets delivered **double-digit topline growth** and remains **very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and national priorities** in missiles, tactical defense systems, and space and launch systems.” [Karman Space & Defense Full-Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results]( Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside **America’s missile defense buildup, hypersonic development race, and next-generation launch ecosystem**. But to understand how deep that goes, we begin with a move that opened new doors. # The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year, Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. (MTI), a company specializing in **ultra-high-temperature refractory alloys** used in strategic missile systems. MTI works with materials such as Tantalum, Zirconium, Niobium, Vanadium, and Molybdenum. These aren’t ordinary metals. They are **engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys**. With this acquisition, Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities, access to high-specification missile programs, **deeper integration into classified supply chains**, increased revenue and EBITDA, and expanded design and manufacturing scope. KRMN reaffirmed that it is not just a supplier, but a *strategic* supplier. # Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles. Why? Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished, global conflicts have continued to drive demand, allies are purchasing next-generation tactical systems, and missile defense is entering a new strategic era. Karman provides the structures, subsystems, and assemblies that make these systems operational. Now, it’s not about whether there’s a war or not. Of course, I don’t want *any* wars. But even in peacetime, **missile defense isn’t slowing down**. It’s accelerating. And now Karman sits closer to the core. # Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highest-temperature, highest-priority arms race on Earth. **Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade**. Every major power is investing, testing, and racing toward Mach-5+ platforms. But **few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses**. Karman is one of them. This segment’s revenue surged thanks to well-funded programs in both development and production, **backed by aggressive government budgets**. Karman’s offerings (propulsion, deployable shrouds, launchers, energetic subsystems) are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems. This is not speculative work. This is strategic infrastructure. # Space and Launch Systems This is **where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge**. Revenue here increased due to Karman’s involvement in two next-generation launch vehicles. # Blue Origin’s New Glenn A heavy-lift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites, space infrastructure, and future deep-space missions. It is still in a development stage. Although, on November 13, 2025, the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time. The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027. Blue Origin’s customer base: * Commercial satellite operators. * Government payloads. * Potential national-security missions. [New Glenn]( is designed to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy. Its reusable first stage, massive payload capacity, and **long-term contract potential with DoD and NASA** make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem. Karman supplies components used in New Glenn’s structures and launch systems. # ULA’s Vulcan A next-generation launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). [Vulcan]( is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV, the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. national-security launches. It has already flown its first successful mission. This rocket is built to serve: * U.S. Space Force. * DoD national-security missions. * Commercial payloads. * NASA deep-space missions. Vulcan is engineered specifically for **National Security Space Launch (NSSL)** contracts: The elite, highest-priority, and highest-specification launches in America’s defense architecture and orbital missions. It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defense-related payloads over the next decade. And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan’s architecture. # Whichever Rocket Wins, Karman Wins This isn’t about picking sides in the rocket race. It isn’t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads, or which timeline slips, or which program accelerates. Karman supplies critical hardware to *both* ULA’s Vulcan and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. Karman’s components run through the veins of *both* launch systems. Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts, Karman wins with it. If national-security payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another, the outcome is the same: **Karman benefits either way**. # Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play. **If you understand this one idea**, the rest of the thesis can open itself to you. **You don’t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade**. You don’t have to choose heads or tails. Because with Karman, **it isn’t about the side of the coin**. **It’s just about the coin being flipped into the air**. **As long as rockets are being launched** (commercial, government, national-security, deep-space, doesn’t matter) **Karman benefits**. The rivalry is irrelevant. **The activity itself is the catalyst**. # The Short-Term Decline Now, yes, Karman, like many other growth names, was bruised over the past few weeks. The stock is down –24.80% since the close on November 3, 2025. Personally, I bought (and keep buying) the dip *gradually*. There was support in the high $50s (Karman has bounced from there, though), and the stock did ride a +23.37% rally in four days (Nov 21-26), so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap. Check the chart. Once it runs, it runs north fast. You should also know the KRMN play, although great for swings, is mostly meant for the **long term**. This is a **structural story**, not a short-lived trade. I did buy a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** for cheap, though. Of course, this one is a cheap, low-risk, high-reward play if it works. Quite simply, the stock can move $10 in a couple of days, and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike, these become multi-baggers. But, again, the main play is for the long-term. # Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23, portfolio manager [Randy Gwirtzman]( of Baron Capital published a Barron’s article highlighting small-cap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential. He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward **companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions**. His focus, however, is on profitability, a key filter, especially when bond yields spike. Karman Holdings popped up on his list. And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could **benefit enormously** in the coming years: **Trump’s Golden Dome plans**. Now, everything in this post has been the backdrop, the scaffolding, the necessary foundation. In my next post, if this DD gets approved/noticed, I’ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself, what it is, why it matters, and why a small, overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly, along with several more developments from KRMN.

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Here ’ s the whole thesis If you believe space launches will increase if you expect NASA commercial satellite operators nationalsecurity agencies and private launch companies will keep expanding activity into orbit then Karman is a littleknown company you need to know . The Short Sweet Karman Holdings $ KRMN is a littleknown aerospace and defense company posting numbers that look nothing_like the obscurity of its stock . Revenue up 23 % YoY net income up 191 % and a funded backlog up 35 % with guidance calling for another year and beyond of doubledigit expansion . For a company most of you haven ’ t even heard of these are eyepopping metrics . The driver is straightforward Karman builds highspec structures subsystems and assemblies for missiles hypersonics and nextgen launch vehicles . Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–hightemperature alloys for materials used in strategic missile programs where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive . That move pushed Karman deeper into classified supply chains tied to U.S. rearmament allied purchases and the global shift toward tactical missile systems . Karman also sits inside both of the nextdecade launch platforms Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn and ULA ’ s Vulcan . Each is designed for national security deepspace and commercial missions . And since Karman supplies structural components to both vehicles you don ’ t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst . Karman wins either way . Karman ’ s core markets missile defense hypersonics and launch systems are expanding not_contracting . That makes its recent pullback attractive . Takeaway Karman is a rare case of a true hidden gem . The company sits inside every major missile and launch trend and that trend will just accelerate . The Long Winding Karman Holdings $ KRMN is an undertheradar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. space and missiledefense programs . But before we talk about what this company actually does we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings . After all numbers don ’ t care about narratives . They don ’ t hype . They simply record the truth especially the kind most people dont pay attention to . Karman ’ s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual . A company whose trajectory doesn ’ t match its obscurity . Growth hiding behind smallcap camouflage . The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small the numbers don ’ t lie . They signal momentum . And momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental . FY2024 A Record Across the Board On April 8 2025 KRMN reported Revenue $ 345.3M 23 % YoY Net income $ 12.7M 191.3 % YoY Adjusted EBITDA $ 106.1M 29.7 % YoY Funded backlog $ 579.8M 35.2 % YoY For a smallcap contractor these are not_ordinary numbers . This is a company stepping into a larger orbit . 2025 Outlook Expansion Not_Consolidation For FY2025 Karman expects Revenue $ 423– $ 433M Adjusted EBITDA $ 132– $ 137M Doubledigit growth on top of doubledigit growth . Q1 2025 The Trend Continued On May 13 2025 EPS $ 0.05 vs. $ 0.02 est . Revenue $ 100.12M 20.6 % YoY Guidance reaffirmed . No_slowdown . At this point some of you might realize that even though you ’ ve never_heard of this company these numbers look interesting . And they are . Because once you peel back the veil the reason becomes obvious . The CEO Speaks After delivering the Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025 Tony Koblinski Karman ’ s Chief Executive Officer summarized it this way “ Across numerous key metrics we achieved record performance in 2024 that positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond . Each of our end markets delivered doubledigit topline growth and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and national priorities in missiles tactical defense systems and space and launch systems. ” Karman Space Defense FullFiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside America ’ s missile defense buildup hypersonic development race and nextgeneration launch ecosystem . But to understand how deep that goes we begin with a move that opened new doors . The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. MTI a company specializing in ultrahightemperature refractory alloys used in strategic missile systems . MTI works with materials such as Tantalum Zirconium Niobium Vanadium and Molybdenum . These aren ’ t ordinary metals . They are engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys . With this acquisition Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities access to highspecification missile programs deeper integration into classified supply chains increased revenue and EBITDA and expanded design and manufacturing scope . KRMN reaffirmed that it is not_just a supplier but a strategic supplier . Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles . Why Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished global conflicts have continued to drive demand allies are purchasing nextgeneration tactical systems and missile defense is entering a new strategic era . Karman provides the structures subsystems and assemblies that make these systems operational . Now it ’ s not_about whether there ’ s a war or not_Of course I don ’ t want any wars . But even in peacetime missile defense isn ’ t slowing down . It ’ s accelerating . And now Karman sits closer to the core . Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highesttemperature highestpriority arms race on Earth . Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade . Every major power is investing testing and racing toward Mach5 platforms . But few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses . Karman is one of them . This segment ’ s revenue surged thanks to wellfunded programs in both development and production backed by aggressive government budgets . Karman ’ s offerings propulsion deployable shrouds launchers energetic subsystems are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems . This is not_speculative work . This is strategic infrastructure . Space and Launch Systems This is where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge . Revenue here increased due to Karman ’ s involvement in two nextgeneration launch vehicles . Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn A heavylift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites space infrastructure and future deepspace missions . It is still in a development stage . Although on November 13 2025 the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time . The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027 . Blue Origin ’ s customer base Commercial satellite operators . Government payloads . Potential nationalsecurity missions . New Glenn is designed to compete with SpaceX ’ s Falcon Heavy . Its reusable first stage massive payload capacity and longterm contract potential with DoD and NASA make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem . Karman supplies components used in New Glenn ’ s structures and launch systems . ULA ’ s Vulcan A nextgeneration launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance a joint venture between Boeing BA and Lockheed Martin LMT . Vulcan is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. nationalsecurity launches . It has already flown its first successful mission . This rocket is built to serve U.S. Space Force . DoD nationalsecurity missions . Commercial payloads . NASA deepspace missions . Vulcan is engineered specifically for National Security Space Launch NSSL contracts The elite highestpriority and highestspecification launches in America ’ s defense architecture and orbital missions . It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defenserelated payloads over the next decade . And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan ’ s architecture . Whichever Rocket Wins Karman Wins This isn ’ t about picking sides in the rocket race . It isn ’ t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads or which timeline slips or which program accelerates . Karman supplies critical hardware to both ULA ’ s Vulcan and Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn . Karman ’ s components run through the veins of both launch systems . Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts Karman wins with it . If nationalsecurity payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another the outcome is the same Karman benefits either way . Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play . If you understand this one idea the rest of the thesis can open itself to you . You don ’ t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade . You don ’ t have to choose heads or tails . Because with Karman it isn ’ t about the side of the coin . It ’ s just about the coin being flipped into the air . As long as rockets are being launched commercial government nationalsecurity deepspace doesn ’ t matter Karman benefits . The rivalry is irrelevant . The activity itself is the catalyst . The ShortTerm Decline Now yes Karman like many other growth names was bruised over the past few weeks . The stock is down –24.80 % since the close on November 3 2025 . Personally I bought and keep buying the dip gradually . There was support in the high $ 50s Karman has bounced from there though and the stock did ride a 23.37 % rally in four days Nov 2126 so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap . Check the chart . Once it runs it runs north fast . You should also know the KRMN play although great for swings is mostly meant for the long term . This is a structural story not_a shortlived trade . I did buy a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls for cheap though . Of course this one is a cheap lowrisk highreward play if it works . Quite simply the stock can move $ 10 in a couple of days and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike these become multibaggers . But again the main play is for the longterm . Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23 portfolio manager Randy Gwirtzman of Baron Capital published a Barron ’ s article highlighting smallcap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential . He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions . His focus however is on profitability a key filter especially when bond yields spike . Karman Holdings popped up on his list . And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could benefit enormously in the coming years Trump ’ s Golden Dome plans . Now everything in this post has been the backdrop the scaffolding the necessary foundation . In my next post if this DD gets approvednoticed I ’ ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself what it is why it matters and why a small overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly along with several more developments from KRMN . Have a nice day ."

      "title": "Is Tesla Really Slowing Down or Just Resetting?",
      "selftext": "After following Tesla closely for a while now, I keep wondering if what i'm seeing is just a pause or something more significant. Free cash flow jumped by over 540% in FY 2025 Q3, which is huge, but at the same time gross margin dropped to 17% and EPS growth fell by 64%. It makes me think how a company can produce that much cash while its core earnings are under such pressure. The numbers seem to be pulling in different directions and that tension is hard to ignore. I noticed analysts are all over the map on Tesla. Price targets range from $145 up to $860. Some, like Piper Sandler and Wedbush, see a lot of potential upside while Morgan Stanley points to high valuations and forecasts a 20% decline in electric vehicle sales by 2026. and i wonder if the market is really entering an EV winter or is this just a temporary slowdown as competition and regulatory pressure build? For me, it feels like there is more happening beneath the surface than the short-term metrics suggest. Insider activity adds another layer to consider. Elon Musk received a stock award valued at $141.57 billion while Kimbal Musk’s stock gift was much smaller. That contrast makes me feel there is still a lot of confidence in Tesla’s long-term direction even if it doesn’t show in the quarterly numbers even the volume i’m seeing on uex like bitget futures on tsla is making me wonder if people are still having high hope in it, but another mind is still wondering whether they are just there for the META stock extras. Operationally, the company is projected to meet seven out of twelve milestones in Musk’s compensation plan by 2035, which tells me growth might not be disappearing, it is just taking a different path than some might expect. But right now, I’m leaning toward staying curious and watching closely. Cash flow, market sentiment, analyst expectations, and insider moves all seem to tell slightly different stories. To me, that is what makes Tesla so fascinating right now. you?",

      "selftext_processed": "After following Tesla closely for a while now I keep wondering if what im seeing is just a pause or something more significant . Free cash flow jumped by over 540 % in FY 2025 Q3 which is huge but at the same time gross margin dropped to 17 % and EPS growth fell by 64 % . It makes me think how a company can produce that much cash while its core earnings are under such pressure . The numbers seem to be pulling in different directions and that tension is hard to ignore . I noticed analysts are all over the map on Tesla . Price targets range from $ 145 up to $ 860 . Some like Piper Sandler and Wedbush see a lot of potential upside while Morgan Stanley points to high valuations and forecasts a 20 % decline in electric vehicle sales by 2026. and i wonder if the market is really entering an EV winter or is this just a temporary slowdown as competition and regulatory pressure build For me it feels like there is more happening beneath the surface than the shortterm metrics suggest . Insider activity adds another layer to consider . Elon Musk received a stock award valued at $ 141.57 billion while Kimbal Musk ’ s stock gift was much smaller . That contrast makes me feel there is still a lot of confidence in Tesla ’ s longterm direction even if it doesn ’ t show in the quarterly numbers even the volume i ’ m seeing on uex like bitget futures on tsla is making me wonder if people are still having high hope in it but another mind is still wondering whether they are just there for the META stock extras . Operationally the company is projected to meet seven out of twelve milestones in Musk ’ s compensation plan by 2035 which tells me growth might not_be disappearing it is just taking a different path than some might expect . But right now I ’ m leaning toward staying curious and watching closely . Cash flow market sentiment analyst expectations and insider moves all seem to tell slightly different stories . To me that is what makes Tesla so fascinating right now . you"

      "selftext": "US stocks weakened overall today, primarily due to market uncertainty surrounding the Fed's future interest rate policy, rising bond yields, and some institutions reducing their holdings due to concerns about overvaluation in the technology sector, leading to cautious market sentiment. Major stock indices and the Nasdaq ETFs (SPY, QQQ) all declined slightly; Apple shares fell, Google shares fell more, while Microsoft remained relatively resilient, rising slightly. Overall, given the uncertainty in the macroeconomy, this is a normal technical adjustment. From a technical perspective, the Nasdaq index formed a double top pattern on the hourly chart and subsequently retreated. Market volatility is normal during such a volatile period, but for individual investors, prudent asset allocation and appropriate risk management are more important. Long-term planning and maintaining a margin of safety are always more reassuring than chasing highs and lows.",

      "selftext": "Waymo, the robotaxi unit owned by Alphabet, has crossed 450,000 weekly paid rides, according to a letter from investor Tiger Global viewed by CNBC. That’s almost double the milestone it hit in April, when Waymo reported 250,000 paid robotaxi rides a week in the U.S. “Waymo is the clear leader in autonomous driving, recently surpassing 450k trips per week with a product that is 10x safer than human drivers,” Tiger Global wrote in a letter to investors announcing the launch of a new fund. Tiger’s 450,000-ride estimate is based on publicly available data. Waymo is one of the largest positions in Tiger’s 2024 fund. Waymo declined to comment. This year, Waymo has also announced a slew of expansions, including its debut on freeways in three cities, and autonomous driving in cities including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando. The latest milestone is also another sign that Waymo is continuing to push ahead of aspiring self-driving competitor Tesla, which has run limited pilots in Austin and operates a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area. Tesla vehicles include human drivers or safety supervisors on board and are not driverless like Waymo’s fleet vehicles. According to Tesla’s latest earnings call, executives said the company hit a quarter of a million miles with its fleet in Austin, and more than one million in the Bay Area. In July, Waymo announced 100 million total fully autonomous miles. Source: [",

      "selftext": "Deepseek just launched its latest model which outperform's GOOG's Gemini 3 pro and other models on benchmarks. For some reason, this hasn't been picked up by most financial media. The fact that China can produce the best LLM in the world despite export controls on American hardware companies suggests many things that are bearish for US tech: 1. **You don't need that large of a scale of Nvidia hardware to build a best-in-class LLM. Talented researchers matter more** China gets its hands on American hardware in smaller quantities via smuggling, but cannot procure hardware to the same scale that American hyperscalers can. This raises into question the entire investment cycle of datacenters in the US. 2. **GOOG is not actually ahead in the AI race**, like the market actually believes. Their access to data(via crawlers that can't be blocked without sacrificing SEO) and scale is not enough for them to beat Deepseek.",

For some reason this hasnt been picked up by most financial media . The fact that China can produce the best LLM in the world despite export controls on American hardware companies suggests many things that are bearish for US tech 1 . You dont need that large of a scale of Nvidia hardware to build a bestinclass LLM . Talented researchers matter more China gets its hands on American hardware in smaller quantities via smuggling but can not procure hardware to the same scale that American hyperscalers can . This raises into question the entire investment cycle of datacenters in the US . 2 . GOOG is not_actually ahead in the AI race like the market actually believes . Their access to datavia crawlers that cant be blocked without sacrificing SEO and scale is not_enough for them to beat Deepseek ."

      "selftext": "Morgan Stanley just downgraded Tesla to a hold, saying the stock is now at a full valuation even as Elon Musk continues to pitch the company as a future robotics and AI powerhouse. Right now, Tesla is trading at around 210x forward earnings, making it one of the most expensive stocks in the entire S&P 500 second only to Warner Bros. Discovery, and well ahead of Palantir. That valuation already assumes big success in areas like robotics and artificial intelligence, according to the bank. The downgrade isn’t a call that Tesla’s future vision is wrong it’s more about the stock price already reflecting those ambitions. In other words, the growth story may still be intact, but the risk-reward at these levels looks stretched. Feels like this is less about Tesla as a company and more about how much future investors are already paying for today. Source: [",

      "selftext": "I am 41, and I have always followed traditional advice, max out 401k, ira contributions, taxable brokerage in index funds, my portfolio is about 520k, a standard three fund portfolio basically and returns have been fine, averaging around 9% annually over the long term. I started reading about options earlier this year, it honestly seemed risky and complicated, and definitely outside my comfort zone, but I kept seeing discussions about systematic approaches that generate income without requiring market predictions, and so I decided to test with 25k, about 5% of my portfolio, which is small enough to lose without panic. I spent 3 weeks paper trading before going live, and my strategy is selling credit spreads on spx, nothing fancy then follow specific entry rules, defined position sizing, clear exit criteria. 8 weeks in, the account is up 11.4%. I made money 6 out of 8 weeks, two losing weeks that gave back about 4% total and the time commitment is minimal, maybe 10 minutes daily at market close when I get trade signals, but what surprised me most is how systematic it can be, I thought options trading was all gut feel and predictions, but this approach removes discretion completely, just follow the rules, take the outcome, and don't overthink it. I'm still treating this as an experiment, I will not scale up allocation until I have tracked a full year including some market turbulence. But so far it's adding value to my portfolio without creating stress or consuming time.",

I started reading about options earlier this year it honestly seemed risky and complicated and definitely outside my comfort zone but I kept seeing discussions about systematic approaches that generate income without requiring market predictions and so I decided to test with 25k about 5 % of my portfolio which is small enough to lose without panic . I spent 3 weeks paper trading before going live and my strategy is selling credit spreads on spx nothing_fancy then follow specific entry rules defined position sizing clear exit criteria . 8 weeks in the account is up 11.4 % . I made money 6 out of 8 weeks two losing weeks that gave back about 4 % total and the time commitment is minimal maybe 10 minutes daily at market close when I get trade signals but what surprised me most is how systematic it can be I thought options trading was all gut feel and predictions but this approach removes discretion completely just follow the rules take the outcome and dont overthink it . Im still treating this as an experiment I will not_scale up allocation until I have tracked a full year including some market turbulence . But so far its adding value to my portfolio without creating stress or consuming time ."

A term sheet seen by Reuters suggests this would be one of the largest private funding rounds in the robotics AI space so far. Skild AI develops foundation models for robots, which are large AI systems designed to help machines understand and interact with the physical world a different challenge than text- or image-based AI. While language models dominate headlines, robotics models aim to bring intelligence into warehouses, factories, logistics, and even household environments. The potential investor lineup is notable. SoftBank has a long history of large tech bets, especially in AI and robotics, going back to its early ARM investment and its aggressive Vision Fund era. Nvidia, on the other hand, continues to expand beyond just selling chips quietly positioning itself across the entire AI ecosystem, from data centers to software and now physical-world AI. If this deal goes through, it would signal that big money is shifting focus from just generative AI into real-world automation, where returns could take longer but potentially reshape entire industries. It also raises questions about valuations: a $14B price tag for a private robotics startup shows how aggressive capital remains in the AI space, even after recent volatility in tech stocks.

      "title": "MoonLake ($MLTX) YOLO. DD. Divorce.",
      "selftext": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics ($MLTX) YOLO. I added on to my position here today. **I still like the stock.** TL;DR: MoonLake ($MLTX) is primed to be a chronic inflammatory disease (CID) powerhouse. We have an upcoming FDA Type B meeting on December 15, 2025. This is just the beginning. MoonLake has a shareholder friendly management team and a massive potential addressable market. We already have a robust dataset from various clinical trials on SLK efficacy across various indications in the CID landscape. DD is available here: [ We recently got a Phase 2 LEDA data readout just last month. PPP is an untapped market; there are no approved treatments for PPP in the US or EU and the company plans to move forward with a Phase 3 next year. [ Also, I don’t really like talking about personal details, but here is some context: My personal life is a mess. I’m living out of a hotel right now. My wife kicked me out of the house, removed my access from the Tesla app, and took our only car. [Telsa]( I currently have a rental car, and the internet here is horrible. I’m moving to another one later today; my morning is stacked with meetings. I need to physically move hotels, as well as secure various accounts. My soon-to-be ex-wife linked her new bank account to one of my Fidelity accounts last night. I set up UTMA accounts for my kids that each have about 100K in them currently, which I already don’t have access to trade. (Side note: If my soon-to-be ex-wife happens to read this: please take some free cash in there and invest it in MLTX for the children) [Sneaky Links?]( I say this for context; I believe I am finally seeing things more clearly than I have in a while, but there are distractions everywhere. I’ll try and answer any questions as they come up, but that may not be until later because my personal life is a mess, and I think everyone has a right to know what I’m going through for perspective. I said weeks ago here: That I fully expect MLTX to buy me a car, maybe a house: [Reddit r\\/InvestingandTrading]( I’m buying another car and likely another house. I fully expect MLTX stock to more than pay for it… But I’m not selling MLTX stock. Luckily, I have other trades like this I can free up capital with: [Silver 100&#37; YTD]( And anyone who knows me personally knows I like silver, even at these levels. With the long standing global fiscal deficits, the increasing global debt levels, the cost to service this debt is going to be increasingly monetization. Debasement has to accelerate here. This is bullish for real assets. Stock valuations are currently elevated. Does it make sense that stock valuations are this high? TINA. Increasingly, there is no alternative. Holders of debt-based currencies are going to increasingly lose purchasing power. That dynamic is outstandingly bullish for real assets comparatively. Silver is positioned as one of the most atractive metals right now with a tight supply and robust industrial demand, and a persistent supply deficit. We have already seen cracks in the silver market, and the world needs hard money now more than ever. That just goes to say, as much as I like silver, I like MLTX more. I don’t reduce my silver position lightly. MLTX is poised as the single greatest asymmetric setup I have seen in my investment career, and the catalysts are staggering: [MLTX Catalyst Pipeline]( I’ve said before I don’t like price targets, and I’ve said MLTX can 3X, 4X, or 5X by next year. Next year is only a few weeks away. MLTX is currently a 1 billion dollar company as I write this. The opportunity across the CID space is huge. A 10X from here only needs MLTX to hit roughly a 10 billion market capitalization. That equates to right around $140 a share. Long-term, MLTX appreciation can potentially rise much higher with the variety of CID indications SLK can possibly address. [Possible SLK Indications]( On top of this, MoonLake appears to have one of the best management teams I have seen. The company is quick, capital-efficient, and transparent. They should not need to dilute going forward; they have a cash runway well into 2027. They are not burdened by any massive debt. Additionally, they have a non-dilutive debt facility in place to provide additional funding well into potential commercialization. This is a management team that respects shareholders. This is a company that I want to be part of. Some context on options: Please be responsible here. MLTX is still a small cap stock. MLTX options are thinly traded with wide spreads and low liquidity. I can't recommend trading these unless you fully understand the risks you are taking. I have December 2025 calls because it was a very cost-effective way to gain leverage, and it’s a very small percentage of my overall allocation to MLTX. I am willing to lose the entire investment, and to make these pay off, I am pretty much relying on a positive statement from the company after the Dec 15 FDA meeting outlining a path forward for an SLK BLA for HS prior to expiration as the official minutes from the meeting I don’t expect to be released until well after the expiration date. I am not relying on the official FDA meeting minutes. I expect these things to happen, but the timing is tight. The timing risk is real, and if this catalyst misses the tight window of the Dec options expiration, they are worthless. If I had limited capital, I was willing to lose; that’s my lottery ticket. But if they pay off – I’m looking at a potential 100X or more on the invested capital on those options. Taking asymmetric payoff on an asymmetric stock is capital efficiency at its best. A path forward to SLK approval after the Dec 15 FDA Type B meeting could rerate MLTX violently higher. I also have some other short-dated calls I put on just to gain inexpensive leverage to potential MLTX appreciation; the bulk of my position is as a long-term MLTX shareholder. This is not financial advice. But please take this advice: don’t play the lottery if you don’t have the capital to lose, and do your due diligence first. Not just on MLTX, but any investment. Misinformation is everywhere. Trade smart, stay disciplined, Richard Doxtator, MBA, CFA",

      "selftext_processed": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics $ MLTX YOLO . I added on to my position here today . I still like the stock . TLDR MoonLake $ MLTX is primed to be a chronic inflammatory disease CID powerhouse . We have an upcoming FDA Type B meeting on December 15 2025 . This is just the beginning . MoonLake has a shareholder friendly management team and a massive potential addressable market . We already have a robust dataset from various clinical trials on SLK efficacy across various indications in the CID landscape . DD is available here We recently got a Phase 2 LEDA data readout just last month . PPP is an untapped market there are no_approved treatments for PPP in the US or EU and the company plans to move forward with a Phase 3 next year . Also I don ’ t really like talking about personal details but here is some context My personal life is a mess . I ’ m living out of a hotel right now . My wife kicked me out of the house removed my access from the Tesla app and took our only car . Telsa I currently have a rental car and the internet here is horrible . I ’ m moving to another one later today my morning is stacked with meetings . I need to physically move hotels as well as secure various accounts . My soontobe exwife linked her new bank account to one of my Fidelity accounts last night . I set up UTMA accounts for my kids that each have about 100K in them currently which I already don ’ t have access to trade . Side note If my soontobe exwife happens to read this please take some free cash in there and invest it in MLTX for the children Sneaky Links I say this for context I believe I am finally seeing things more clearly than I have in a while but there are distractions everywhere . I ’ ll try and answer any questions as they come up but that may not_be until later because my personal life is a mess and I think everyone has a right to know what I ’ m going through for perspective . I said weeks ago here That I fully expect MLTX to buy me a car maybe a house Reddit rInvestingandTrading I ’ m buying another car and likely another house . I fully expect MLTX stock to more than pay for it… But I ’ m not_selling MLTX stock . Luckily I have other trades like this I can free up capital with Silver 10037 YTD And anyone who knows me personally knows I like silver even at these levels . With the long standing global fiscal deficits the increasing global debt levels the cost to service this debt is going to be increasingly monetization . Debasement has to accelerate here . This is bullish for real assets . Stock valuations are currently elevated . Does it make sense that stock valuations are this high TINA . Increasingly there is no_alternative . Holders of debtbased currencies are going to increasingly lose purchasing power . That dynamic is outstandingly bullish for real assets comparatively . Silver is positioned as one of the most atractive metals right now with a tight supply and robust industrial demand and a persistent supply deficit . We have already seen cracks in the silver market and the world needs hard money now more than ever . That just goes to say as much as I like silver I like MLTX more . I don ’ t reduce my silver position lightly . MLTX is poised as the single greatest asymmetric setup I have seen in my investment career and the catalysts are staggering MLTX Catalyst Pipeline I ’ ve said before I don ’ t like price targets and I ’ ve said MLTX can 3X 4X or 5X by next year . Next year is only a few weeks away . MLTX is currently a 1 billion dollar company as I write this . The opportunity across the CID space is huge . A 10X from here only needs MLTX to hit roughly a 10 billion market capitalization . That equates to right around $ 140 a share . Longterm MLTX appreciation can potentially rise much higher with the variety of CID indications SLK can possibly address . Possible SLK Indications On top of this MoonLake appears to have one of the best management teams I have seen . The company is quick capitalefficient and transparent . They should not_need to dilute going forward they have a cash runway well into 2027 . They are not_burdened by any massive debt . Additionally they have a nondilutive debt facility in place to provide additional funding well into potential commercialization . This is a management team that respects shareholders . This is a company that I want to be part of . Some context on options Please be responsible here . MLTX is still a small cap stock . MLTX options are thinly traded with wide spreads and low liquidity . I cant recommend trading these unless you fully understand the risks you are taking . I have December 2025 calls because it was a very costeffective way to gain leverage and it ’ s a very small percentage of my overall allocation to MLTX . I am willing to lose the entire investment and to make these pay off I am pretty much relying on a positive statement from the company after the Dec 15 FDA meeting outlining a path forward for an SLK BLA for HS prior to expiration as the official minutes from the meeting I don ’ t expect to be released until well after the expiration date . I am not_relying on the official FDA meeting minutes . I expect these things to happen but the timing is tight . The timing risk is real and if this catalyst misses the tight window of the Dec options expiration they are worthless . If I had limited capital I was willing to lose that ’ s my lottery ticket . But if they pay off – I ’ m looking at a potential 100X or more on the invested capital on those options . Taking asymmetric payoff on an asymmetric stock is capital efficiency at its best . A path forward to SLK approval after the Dec 15 FDA Type B meeting could rerate MLTX violently higher . I also have some other shortdated calls I put on just to gain inexpensive leverage to potential MLTX appreciation the bulk of my position is as a longterm MLTX shareholder . This is not_financial advice . But please take this advice don ’ t play the lottery if you don ’ t have the capital to lose and do your due diligence first . Not_just on MLTX but any investment . Misinformation is everywhere . Trade smart stay disciplined Richard Doxtator MBA CFA"

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I currently hold a broad diversified ETF as the core of my portfolio, but I’d like to add a small tech position to boost long-term growth (5–10 years). If you had to choose one individual stock for a long-term tech tilt, would you go with Meta or Microsoft? Microsoft seems strongly positioned in AI through Azure + OpenAI, while Meta has strong advertising growth and LLaMA, but is more volatile. Which one do you think offers the better long-term risk/reward profile? Thanks!",

The stock is currently trading around $466.76. Even after the pullback, Synopsys is still priced pretty richly, with a P/E ratio of about 63, which keeps valuation concerns front and center.

      "selftext": "According to the UBS Billionaire Ambitions Report 2025, a total of 287 new billionaires were created this year, pushing the global count to 2,919. Total billionaire wealth rose to a record $15.8 trillion by the end of Q3, up about 13% from last year. Out of the total, 2,059 billionaires are self-made while 860 inherited their wealth. This is the second-highest number of new billionaires UBS has ever recorded, behind only 2021. Over the last four years alone, 727 people have crossed the billionaire mark. While tech and AI still dominate headlines, this year’s new billionaires came from a wider mix of sectors including software, genetics, infrastructure, natural gas, and even restaurants. Some of the new names include Colossal co-founder Ben Lamm, Stonepeak CEO Michael Dorrell, and Venture Global founders Bob Pender and Mike Sabel. Source: [",

      "selftext": "Let’s say John keeps a lightbulb on in an empty room for 20 hours, after which his name and the number 1 are written into a public table. Mike keeps the same kind of lightbulb on for 100 hours, so the number 5 is written next to his name. The numbers proportionally represent the energy spent. Later, Alex pays 100,000 dollars to have the number 1 written next to his name, and to have everything next to John’s name erased to 0. The question: Did John \"mine\" some coins or create money or an asset? Did Alex invest? No. It is funny to even ask. John and Mike spent energy and received some kind of measure of that expenditure. That is all that happened. Alex simply bought that measure, which updated the table. No money or asset was created, and there is nothing to invest in. There is only a table with numbers. This is exactly how Bitcoin works. Instead of a lightbulb in an empty room, energy is wasted on useless guessing of hash values. The result is a numerical metric of energy expenditure (btc). After that, people pay to have that metric placed next to their IDs, and these entries are stored in a distributed table called the blockchain. There is nothing to invest in because investment always rests on a resource that generates a return. Let’s look at examples to make this obvious. With stocks, there is a company that creates profit and has capital. Returns in the form of dividends, buybacks, or liquidation value come from these sources. With bonds, there is a debtor who must repay the debt. The dollar is a more complex type of investment. Here is how it works in practice. A bank lends money to a company by creating dollars out of nothing. The company uses those dollars to pay workers and buy machinery and then produces, say, a car. You buy the car and pay with dollars. The company then takes those dollars back to the bank to repay the loan. When the bank receives the dollars, it simply deletes them, removes them from its balance sheet, and they disappear from the market. You received a car, and the dollar as an investment did its job and vanished. The return, in the form of the car, came from the company that owed the bank. Or another example: you pay taxes to the government in dollars. The government uses those dollars to repay its bonds held by the Federal Reserve. Those dollars are deleted from the Fed’s balance sheet and disappear from the market. You received a service, meaning your tax obligation was erased and you do not go to jail. Again, the return in the form of that service came from the debtor (the government). Bitcoin is not issued like a company share or as someone’s debt, so that a company or debtor could generate returns for Bitcoin holders. Also, there is no money, commodity, or asset because every such thing provides some benefit to people, either through the returns mentioned above or directly. Gold conducts electricity and decorates. Wheat feeds. Oil powers machines and heats homes. An MP3 provides entertainment. A painting provides visual experience. Casino chips and gift cards pay out money or goods. All of these things have clearly measurable usefulness for people. Bitcoins (btc), as a metric of energy spent, do none of that. Now, why individuals and institutions pay enormous sums for this metric, why they call it 'money', 'an investment', or 'an asset', and why they call its arbitrary limit 'scarcity', is a phenomenon that one day many fields will study: from cultural anthropologists and scholars of religion, to philosophers and cognitive psychologists, to behavioral economists and experts on memetics. They will study it as the greatest, most expensive, and most successful collective digital cult or mythic phenomenon in the history of humankind.",

      "selftext_processed": "Let ’ s say John keeps a lightbulb on in an empty room for 20 hours after which his name and the number 1 are written into a public table . Mike keeps the same kind of lightbulb on for 100 hours so the number 5 is written next to his name . The numbers proportionally represent the energy spent . Later Alex pays 100000 dollars to have the number 1 written next to his name and to have everything next to John ’ s name erased to 0 . The question Did John mine some coins or create money or an asset Did Alex invest No_It is funny to even ask . John and Mike spent energy and received some kind of measure of that expenditure . That is all that happened . Alex simply bought that measure which updated the table . No_money or asset was created and there is nothing_to invest in . There is only a table with numbers . This is exactly how Bitcoin works . Instead of a lightbulb in an empty room energy is wasted on useless guessing of hash values . The result is a numerical metric of energy expenditure btc . After that people pay to have that metric placed next to their IDs and these entries are stored in a distributed table called the blockchain . There is nothing_to invest in because investment always rests on a resource that generates a return . Let ’ s look at examples to make this obvious . With stocks there is a company that creates profit and has capital . Returns in the form of dividends buybacks or liquidation value come from these sources . With bonds there is a debtor who must repay the debt . The dollar is a more complex type of investment . Here is how it works in practice . A bank lends money to a company by creating dollars out of nothing_The company uses those dollars to pay workers and buy machinery and then produces say a car . You buy the car and pay with dollars . The company then takes those dollars back to the bank to repay the loan . When the bank receives the dollars it simply deletes them removes them from its balance sheet and they disappear from the market . You received a car and the dollar as an investment did its job and vanished . The return in the form of the car came from the company that owed the bank . Or another example you pay taxes to the government in dollars . The government uses those dollars to repay its bonds held by the Federal Reserve . Those dollars are deleted from the Fed ’ s balance sheet and disappear from the market . You received a service meaning your tax obligation was erased and you do not_go to jail . Again the return in the form of that service came from the debtor the government . Bitcoin is not_issued like a company share or as someone ’ s debt so that a company or debtor could generate returns for Bitcoin holders . Also there is no_money commodity or asset because every such thing provides some benefit to people either through the returns mentioned above or directly . Gold conducts electricity and decorates . Wheat feeds . Oil powers machines and heats homes . An MP3 provides entertainment . A painting provides visual experience . Casino chips and gift cards pay out money or goods . All of these things have clearly measurable usefulness for people . Bitcoins btc as a metric of energy spent do none of that . Now why individuals and institutions pay enormous sums for this metric why they call it money an investment or an asset and why they call its arbitrary limit scarcity is a phenomenon that one day many fields will study from cultural anthropologists and scholars of religion to philosophers and cognitive psychologists to behavioral economists and experts on memetics . They will study it as the greatest most expensive and most successful collective digital cult or mythic phenomenon in the history of humankind ."

      "selftext": "*I am just trying to sharpen my analytical skills. My reports are designed for informational purposes only and do not constitute investment advice. Do your own due diligence and contact a professional before investing.* EV: 10.87B, trailing P/E: 5.12, P/S: 0.14, P/B: 0.84, profit Margin: -9.44%, Ret on Equity: -42.19%, Net loss: -1.73B. Goodyear Tire and Rubber, one of the world’s oldest and most iconic tire companies, also ranks as the third-largest tire manufacturer globally. **But competitive pressure from Chinese manufacturers' low-cost efficient production has been particularly damaging to its bottom line.** In fact, the company’s debt-laden capital structure is now marred by decades of failed corporate bureaucrats’ acquisition-driven growth plans that have merely saturated the company's balance sheet with debt and justified corporate officers' juicy pay and benefits packages. **For instance, during his final year as Chairman in 2023, former CEO Richard Kramer was paid a staggering $14.7 million while the company incurred $689 million in losses.** In contrast, Florian Menegaux, the CEO of Michelin, received a total compensation of $3.26 million in 2024. Similarly, Shuichi Ishibashi, the CEO of Bridgestone Global, earned just $1.89 million in 2024 while Bridgestone has consistently maintained its position as the largest and most profitable tire manufacturer globally. Notably, both Michelin and Bridgestone are dividend-paying stocks. **For nearly a decade, Kramer, a CPA by training, mismanaged the company while leading it to a decline in its market share, simultaneously granting himself lavish pay and benefit packages.** **In addition to Chinese entrants in the tire sector, Goodyear’s competitive edge has also been impacted by renewed pressure from its better capitalized international brands such Michelin, Sumitomo, Bridgestone, and Pirelli.** **On the positive note, Goodyear boasts a legacy brand with a leading position in a core essential service sector. The brand’s recognition as a quality tire manufacturer and its popularity among customers stem from its long-standing relationship with manufacturers since the days of Henry Ford's Model T.** **David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management’s recent stock accumulation can be seen as a vote of confidence in management turn around plan, and may even spark retail interest in the company.** [Undervalued metrics or justifiable underperformance?]( Given the company’s substantial liabilities and debt load, further debt restructuring efforts are expected. Shareholders have been sacrificed for far too long, and a turnaround strategy is crucial to improve owner equity. Mark Stewart’s $24M pay package for 2024 must therefore be \" earned\" with stockholders' capital gain. The $3B net equity on total assets of $20B input a more aggressive asset divestiture plan and renewed focus on customer satisfaction and profitability. The company’s depressed shares are therefore poised for a turnaround if corporate officers uphold their commitments in cost reduction and net income maximization. **In conclusion:** **At $8/share, the stock is fairly valued considering the current market downside volatility and the lingering effects of decade-long corporate misaligned strategy in an industry exposed to Chinese low-cost alternatives such as Zhongce rubber Group, Giti Tire, Sailun group, and the Koreans Kumho and Hankook tires.** **A turnaround is probable given the company’s legacy brand and revenues. In fact, a retail meme fervor could easily ignite a fire under the shares, pushing equities to relative highs.** **Should Goodyear ($GT) get acquired?** **Current valuation warrants serious consideration from private equity given management's strategic commitment to optimizing its portfolio, cutting down debt, and improving margins. However, the company's legacy of overpaid \" technocrats\" demands a radical approach. Basically, investors are fed up with the old \" turnaround\" tale designed to gaslight the public and secure execs' compensation package over shareholders' returns: Asset stripping, layoffs, vanity projects...At this juncture, firing the overpaid execs and truly thinning off the balance sheet fat is necessary to salvage the company's legacy.** **Overall, the stock warrants a speculative buy grade. A radical change in executive culture is necessary, warranting either an acquisition or going going-private restructuring.** **Estimated Fair Value: $12/share.** Going private estimation: $18/share.",

Do your own due diligence and contact a professional before investing . EV 10.87B trailing PE 5.12 PS 0.14 PB 0.84 profit Margin 9.44 % Ret on Equity 42.19 % Net loss 1.73B . Goodyear Tire and Rubber one of the world ’ s oldest and most iconic tire companies also ranks as the thirdlargest tire manufacturer globally . But competitive pressure from Chinese manufacturers lowcost efficient production has been particularly damaging to its bottom line . In fact the company ’ s debtladen capital structure is now marred by decades of failed corporate bureaucrats ’ acquisitiondriven growth plans that have merely saturated the companys balance sheet with debt and justified corporate officers juicy pay and benefits packages . For instance during his final year as Chairman in 2023 former CEO Richard Kramer was paid a staggering $ 14.7 million while the company incurred $ 689 million in losses . In contrast Florian Menegaux the CEO of Michelin received a total compensation of $ 3.26 million in 2024 . Similarly Shuichi Ishibashi the CEO of Bridgestone Global earned just $ 1.89 million in 2024 while Bridgestone has consistently maintained its position as the largest and most profitable tire manufacturer globally . Notably both Michelin and Bridgestone are dividendpaying stocks . For nearly a decade Kramer a CPA by training mismanaged the company while leading it to a decline in its market share simultaneously granting himself lavish pay and benefit packages . In addition to Chinese entrants in the tire sector Goodyear ’ s competitive edge has also been impacted by renewed pressure from its better capitalized international brands such Michelin Sumitomo Bridgestone and Pirelli . On the positive note Goodyear boasts a legacy brand with a leading position in a core essential service sector . The brand ’ s recognition as a quality tire manufacturer and its popularity among customers stem from its longstanding relationship with manufacturers since the days of Henry Fords Model T. David Tepper ’ s Appaloosa Management ’ s recent stock accumulation can be seen as a vote of confidence in management turn around plan and may even spark retail interest in the company . Undervalued metrics or justifiable underperformance Given the company ’ s substantial liabilities and debt load further debt restructuring efforts are expected . Shareholders have been sacrificed for far too long and a turnaround strategy is crucial to improve owner equity . Mark Stewart ’ s $ 24M pay package for 2024 must therefore be earned with stockholders capital gain . The $ 3B net equity on total assets of $ 20B input a more aggressive asset divestiture plan and renewed focus on customer satisfaction and profitability . The company ’ s depressed shares are therefore poised for a turnaround if corporate officers uphold their commitments in cost reduction and net income maximization . In conclusion At $ 8share the stock is fairly valued considering the current market downside volatility and the lingering effects of decadelong corporate misaligned strategy in an industry exposed to Chinese lowcost alternatives such as Zhongce rubber Group Giti Tire Sailun group and the Koreans Kumho and Hankook tires . A turnaround is probable given the company ’ s legacy brand and revenues . In fact a retail meme fervor could easily ignite a fire under the shares pushing equities to relative highs . Should Goodyear $ GT get acquired Current valuation warrants serious consideration from private equity given managements strategic commitment to optimizing its portfolio cutting down debt and improving margins . However the companys legacy of overpaid technocrats demands a radical approach . Basically investors are fed up with the old turnaround tale designed to gaslight the public and secure execs compensation package over shareholders returns Asset stripping layoffs vanity projects ... At this juncture firing the overpaid execs and truly thinning off the balance sheet fat is necessary to salvage the companys legacy . Overall the stock warrants a speculative buy grade . A radical change in executive culture is necessary warranting either an acquisition or going goingprivate restructuring . Estimated Fair Value $ 12share . Going private estimation $ 18share ."

      "selftext": "Liquidated my SOFI position last week. This was about half my portfolio. I love the company and think they'll go much further in the long run, however, I personally believe there's an impending market correction inbound and I want to sit on majority cash until then. I don't think it's a \"huge bubble crash that'll destroy capitalism!\" type event, but definitely a correction sometime between April - June next year. Basically it's based on historic events where you had run away crazy insane investing into the new \"it\" thing and even when valuations held up, hype wore off, and while spending didn't stop it was reduced which caused a drawn down/correction. This is what I think will happen to AI on a significant scale. Not a crash, but a correction of about 25% - 30% draw down over a 3 - 8 month period followed by a rebound. 40% drop or more, in this administration, highly unlikely. Overall I think SOFI will be okay and bounce around $25 - $29 until the correction and then hit around $18 - $22 at the low point. Long term, very bullish though. 2028/2029 they will be hitting all time highs again and more. SP500 inclusion and could easily be a $75 billion - $100 billion market cap in early 2030s. But until then I'm going to take advantage of potential upcoming opportunities to increase my gains even more. Not quite sure what the move will be, I have months to wait, but I'm sitting on $600k until then. I have other positions currently open that I'm going to ride through the correction that I feel will fair better long term through the correction, but when the dust settles (around late 2026 - early/mid 2027) I'll jump back into SOFI, and take advantage of other opportunities at the time as well. If this doesn't happen? Oh well. I've been apart of WSB since 2016, and if I have learned anything it's: There's ALWAYS another play.",

      "selftext_processed": "Liquidated my SOFI position last week . This was about half my portfolio . I love the company and think theyll go much further in the long run however I personally believe theres an impending market correction inbound and I want to sit on majority cash until then . I dont think its a huge bubble crash thatll destroy capitalism type event but definitely a correction sometime between April June next year . Basically its based on historic events where you had run away crazy insane investing into the new it thing and even when valuations held up hype wore off and while spending didnt stop it was reduced which caused a drawn downcorrection . This is what I think will happen to AI on a significant scale . Not_a crash but a correction of about 25 % 30 % draw down over a 3 8 month period followed by a rebound . 40 % drop or more in this administration highly unlikely . Overall I think SOFI will be okay and bounce around $ 25 $ 29 until the correction and then hit around $ 18 $ 22 at the low point . Long term very bullish though . 20282029 they will be hitting all time highs again and more . SP500 inclusion and could easily be a $ 75 billion $ 100 billion market cap in early 2030s . But until then Im going to take advantage of potential upcoming opportunities to increase my gains even more . Not_quite sure what the move will be I have months to wait but Im sitting on $ 600k until then . I have other positions currently open that Im going to ride through the correction that I feel will fair better long term through the correction but when the dust settles around late 2026 earlymid 2027 Ill jump back into SOFI and take advantage of other opportunities at the time as well . If this doesnt happen Oh well . Ive been apart of WSB since 2016 and if I have learned anything its Theres ALWAYS another play ."

Mountain View Californiabased Confluent provides technology needed to manage massive realtime data streams for artificial intelligence models . IBM and ⁠Confluent together will enable enterprises ‌to deploy generative and agentic AI better and faster Krishna said in a statement .

The offer price of $ 31 per share represents a premium of around 34 % to Confluents last close . Confluents ​shares surged nearly 30 % in premarket trading while IBM fell more ‌than 2 % . The Confluent stock is up nearly 44 % since October 7 the last trading session before Reuters reported that the company was exploring a sale after attracting acquisition interest .

In April last year ⁠the company bought cloud firm HashiCorp in ​a deal valued at $ 6.4 billion . Its $ 34 billion ​deal for Red Hat in 2019 is credited by analysts as the central catalyst that boosted its cloud business . IBM will fund ‍the Confluent deal ⁠with cash on hand and the transaction is expected to close by the middle of 2026 .

My goal is to invest consistently every month and slowly grow my portfolio over the years. Right now, I’m trying to decide which direction makes more sense in the long run. Should someone focus on interest-bearing savings accounts, precious metals like gold, or a portfolio of stocks and index funds like Nvidia Google etc? I’m especially curious about what tends to perform better over long periods, and how people usually balance these different options based on their goals and risk tolerance.

      "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway announced several structural changes ahead of Warren Buffett stepping down as CEO later this year, and one of the bigger ones is the departure of Todd Combs. Combs, who has been both an investment officer at Berkshire and CEO of Geico, will be moving to JPMorgan Chase. At JPMorgan, he’ll lead a newly created Security and Resiliency Initiative focused on direct equity investments across defense, aerospace, healthcare, and energy. He had already been serving on JPMorgan’s board before this move. With Buffett transitioning out and now Combs leaving, it really feels like Berkshire is entering a new chapter. Curious how people here view the long-term impact of these changes on Berkshire’s investment culture and operating businesses. Source:",

The experience has been... okay. Nothing magical, nothing terrible – just another tool with its own risks and compromises. It is clear that: there is a platform risk buyback guarantees are not real guarantees it can go wrong, especially in unfavorable macroeconomic conditions This is not advice or a recommendation. I'm just interested in what the community thinks about it. So: are you still investing in P2P, or have you completely abandoned it in favor of ETFs/stocks?

      "selftext": "Remember when Bessent said a housing emergency may be declared? I think the government shutdown messed with the timing but now I think we have two catalysts that will make a declaration soon be smart from the White House: 1. Road to Housing Act - somehow a bipartisan bill from Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren. It passed the senate and is attached to the NDAA. Now the house needs to decide if it’s going to add it on their end. Road to Housing is huge and if it passes alone makes my trade good. Ask AI to explain it to you and what it does for housing stocks 2. FOMC meeting. With 2.5 days to go until a decision it would be dumb to introduce anything that could be construed as inflationary towards home prices. If the rate cut hits and Road to Housing passes, things are a lot easier for the executive to do their whole declare stuff that may or may not stick thing. I don’t fully think materials tariffs will be lowered but Bessent did talk about it. Now, there’s a wrinkle here. We don’t have enough construction workers. So from my POV we have two solutions: 1. Lift the cap on H2B workers - which may be done temporarily via executive order, particularly if a housing emergency is declared. 2. Road to Housing act incentivizes localities to relax zoning for manufactured houses. I think Road To Housing is the key element here. It provides a ton of benefits to manufactured housing, small houses, and cheaper housing. It couldn’t move forward without the government reopening. The government is open and we may get our rate cut. It passed the senate, and the White House wants the house to add it. I think this ends up being a path of political survival now that it’s clear affordability is what will be driving voters at midterms. Stocks I bought (see screenshots): Builders and materials: ITB QXO DHI LGIH Manufactured: CVCO SKY UMH ELS More People Buying and Moving: RKT Z COMP I think materials and most builders aren’t ideal for this because the workers shortage is a real bottleneck. Manufactured could be huge here, but DHI and LGIH sell a lot of starter homes. The RKT Z COMP stocks do best if rates fall and if the portable mortgages, 40/50 yr mortgage ideas get put in action. If Hassett replaces JP we’ll probably get the lower rates. Unrelated to all the policy and rate specific stuff, Cathie Wood oddly referenced housing as a good trade 2 days ago: I deleted my last DD on this because it was too heavy on materials and didn’t have the manufactured homes builders. I still want to get this up so I can feel good about having told everyone before it all goes off. Not financial advice.",

      "selftext_processed": "Remember when Bessent said a housing emergency may be declared I think the government shutdown messed with the timing but now I think we have two catalysts that will make a declaration soon be smart from the White House 1 . Road to Housing Act somehow a bipartisan bill from Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren . It passed the senate and is attached to the NDAA . Now the house needs to decide if it ’ s going to add it on their end . Road to Housing is huge and if it passes alone makes my trade good . Ask AI to explain it to you and what it does for housing stocks 2 . FOMC meeting . With 2.5 days to go until a decision it would be dumb to introduce anything that could be construed as inflationary towards home prices . If the rate cut hits and Road to Housing passes things are a lot easier for the executive to do their whole declare stuff that may or may not_stick thing . I don ’ t fully think materials tariffs will be lowered but Bessent did talk about it . Now there ’ s a wrinkle here . We don ’ t have enough construction workers . So from my POV we have two solutions 1 . Lift the cap on H2B workers which may be done temporarily via executive order particularly if a housing emergency is declared . 2 . Road to Housing act incentivizes localities to relax zoning for manufactured houses . I think Road To Housing is the key element here . It provides a ton of benefits to manufactured housing small houses and cheaper housing . It couldn ’ t move forward without the government reopening . The government is open and we may get our rate cut . It passed the senate and the White House wants the house to add it . I think this ends up being a path of political survival now that it ’ s clear affordability is what will be driving voters at midterms . Stocks I bought see screenshots Builders and materials ITB QXO DHI LGIH Manufactured CVCO SKY UMH ELS More People Buying and Moving RKT Z COMP I think materials and most builders aren ’ t ideal for this because the workers shortage is a real bottleneck . Manufactured could be huge here but DHI and LGIH sell a lot of starter homes . The RKT Z COMP stocks do best if rates fall and if the portable mortgages 4050 yr mortgage ideas get put in action . If Hassett replaces JP we ’ ll probably get the lower rates . Unrelated to all the policy and rate specific stuff Cathie Wood oddly referenced housing as a good trade 2 days ago I deleted my last DD on this because it was too heavy on materials and didn ’ t have the manufactured homes builders . I still want to get this up so I can feel good about having told everyone before it all goes off . Not_financial advice ."

      "selftext": "[I created a realistic DCF model using GME's last four quarters.]( Now that GME is net profitable, and the transformation is taking place, it seems useful to project future cashflows based on the current operations from this past year. I created three different scenarios to highlight the different possibilities: * **Bear case $13.36/share**: declining sales, weak traffic, and continued capex cuts for cash preservation. This lower valuation shows GME's resilience through a difficult market. * **Neutral case $18.04/share**: stabilized sales, margins return to historical averages \\~3%, routine store upkeep and slight NWC outflow due to growing inventory from sales. This neutral valuation shows GME's fair price if nothing else really changes. * **Bull case $32.67/share**: Stronger revenue growth, improved operation leverage EBIT margins to 5-6% (historically achievable), more online investments and profitable initiatives (Power Packs), NWC outflows shrinking as inventory turns improve. This shows the upside if GME invests their cash and grows their operations into profitable endeavors. Even in a brutal Bear Case, where revenue slips, margins compress, and working capital works against them, the model still supports a valuation around \\~$13/share. That’s the “everything goes wrong, no turnaround, just pure survival mode” scenario. And GME still doesn’t implode. In the Neutral Case, where the business stabilizes, margins revert to historical norms, and nothing extraordinary happens, the valuation lines up right around \\~$18/share, essentially fairly valued based on what the company is today. But in the Bull Case, where GME executes a modest but realistic operational improvement, better merchandise cycles, cleaner inventory turns, and mid-single-digit EBIT margins, the implied valuation pushes toward \\~$33/share. What’s interesting is that you don’t need hyper growth or moon numbers for that bull scenario. You just need competent execution and reasonable retail economics. The bull case is well within reach if RC can continue focusing on operational improvement. Edit: Updated outstanding shares from 426.5M to 447.91M Edit: Updated D&A rev % on neutral case",

      "selftext_processed": "I created a realistic DCF model using GMEs last four quarters . Now that GME is net profitable and the transformation is taking place it seems useful to project future cashflows based on the current operations from this past year . I created three different scenarios to highlight the different possibilities Bear case $ 13.36share declining sales weak traffic and continued capex cuts for cash preservation . This lower valuation shows GMEs resilience through a difficult market . Neutral case $ 18.04share stabilized sales margins return to historical averages 3 % routine store upkeep and slight NWC outflow due to growing inventory from sales . This neutral valuation shows GMEs fair price if nothing_else really changes . Bull case $ 32.67share Stronger revenue growth improved operation leverage EBIT margins to 56 % historically achievable more online investments and profitable initiatives Power Packs NWC outflows shrinking as inventory turns improve . This shows the upside if GME invests their cash and grows their operations into profitable endeavors . Even in a brutal Bear Case where revenue slips margins compress and working capital works against them the model still supports a valuation around $ 13share . That ’ s the “ everything goes wrong no_turnaround just pure survival mode ” scenario . And GME still doesn ’ t implode . In the Neutral Case where the business stabilizes margins revert to historical norms and nothing_extraordinary happens the valuation lines up right around $ 18share essentially fairly valued based on what the company is today . But in the Bull Case where GME executes a modest but realistic operational improvement better merchandise cycles cleaner inventory turns and midsingledigit EBIT margins the implied valuation pushes toward $ 33share . What ’ s interesting is that you don ’ t need hyper growth or moon numbers for that bull scenario . You just need competent execution and reasonable retail economics . The bull case is well within reach if RC can continue focusing on operational improvement . Edit Updated outstanding shares from 426.5M to 447.91M Edit Updated DA rev % on neutral case"

      "selftext": "Hi all - I bought 160 shares of Palantir in late 2024 in a smaller account. I studied the company and watched the stock like crazy before I invested, but I should’ve bought more. Some were purchased at $31 and some were purchased at $43. I let my dad sometimes manage one of my accounts, a smaller, diversified portfolio, as he has done really well in the stock market. I’ve was pregnant this past year and not looking at my accounts as I didn’t want to make any rash decisions (pregnancy hormones). He asked me in May 2025 if I would think about selling some shares since I made a good profit and he thought palantir’s rapid growth was unsustainable. I told him he could sell 10 shares, but I’d really prefer him not to. In June 2025 I told him, I hope you didn’t sell any palantir, and he replied “you’re good.” I found out last week after I got back on my account for the first time that he sold 160 shares, 60 at $121.02 in May 2025 and 80 shares at $158.65 in August 2025. He didn’t tell me about this, and I didn’t see the emails or check my account so I didn’t find out until last week. Usually I manage my account weekly. Now I only have 20 shares left. In my dads defense, he has made me a lot of money on stocks, so while I am angry at him, he always tells me before he buys and sells and I do the bulk of the trading. My stock advisor only manages big funds and not individual stocks, so he doesn’t place any trades for me. I am wondering if I should buy back Palantir, at least 30 shares, as its growth is expected to continue to skyrocket. I know its trading at $181 but have no problem putting a couple thousand into it.",

I studied the company and watched the stock like crazy before I invested but I should ’ ve bought more . Some were purchased at $ 31 and some were purchased at $ 43 . I let my dad sometimes manage one of my accounts a smaller diversified portfolio as he has done really well in the stock market . I ’ ve was pregnant this past year and not_looking at my accounts as I didn ’ t want to make any rash decisions pregnancy hormones . He asked me in May 2025 if I would think about selling some shares since I made a good profit and he thought palantir ’ s rapid growth was unsustainable . I told him he could sell 10 shares but I ’ d really prefer him not_to . In June 2025 I told him I hope you didn ’ t sell any palantir and he replied “ you ’ re good. ” I found out last week after I got back on my account for the first time that he sold 160 shares 60 at $ 121.02 in May 2025 and 80 shares at $ 158.65 in August 2025 . He didn ’ t tell me about this and I didn ’ t see the emails or check my account so I didn ’ t find out until last week . Usually I manage my account weekly . Now I only have 20 shares left . In my dads defense he has made me a lot of money on stocks so while I am angry at him he always tells me before he buys and sells and I do the bulk of the trading . My stock advisor only manages big funds and not_individual stocks so he doesn ’ t place any trades for me . I am wondering if I should buy back Palantir at least 30 shares as its growth is expected to continue to skyrocket . I know its trading at $ 181 but have no_problem putting a couple thousand into it ."

      "selftext": "I posted this on Friday predicting SP inclusion, but the mods deleted it. Anyway… I’ve been studying/trading Carvana for many years. The key to survival has been understanding that the CVNA CEO and his father (who owns nearly 40% of the diluted share count an sits at #42 in the Forbes list) are evil, but extremely clever. They have manipulated both the share price as well as the company’s financials by controlling the float and establishing 4 quarters of profitability via related party transactions. Their end goal was always SP inclusion, which now creates continuous liquidity to turn back on the 10b5-1 trading plan and unload on passive buyers. Due to the conditions that enabled the above, this ain’t a gap up, it’s a supply crisis. Institutions currently own 90-95% of the tradeable float. The actual loose float available is only 10-15 million shares. Tomorrow morning three big buyers are hitting a wall of zero supply: - Short interest is still ~12M shares. Many are facing a margin call at the open and must buy to cover. - MM were selling calls all week on the rumor. With the AH gap to $440, thousands of Dec 19 contracts just went Deep ITM. MM need to buy 2.5M - 3M shares to stay delta neutral. - The SP500 index funds need to buy roughly 16 million shares (approx. $7B) by Dec 19. They can't buy yet, so arb desks will be buying Monday to warehousefor them. The level of greed is on mars right now because every trading desk is aware of the mechanics and liquidity crunch. Institutions are holding because they know indexes will pay whatever it takes on Dec 18. Buying demand far outweighs supply. It’s hard to say how exactly this plays out, but this is stock is crazy and this event is extremely unique. If I had to guess, CVNA gaps up 15%+ and has the potential to rip higher. I’m expecting a high in the 470-500 range. Absurd, I know, but this is the grand finale of one of the greatest marker manipulations in history. It’ll be fun to watch tomorrow.",

The key to survival has been understanding that the CVNA CEO and his father who owns nearly 40 % of the diluted share count an sits at 42 in the Forbes list are evil but extremely clever . They have manipulated both the share price as well as the company ’ s financials by controlling the float and establishing 4 quarters of profitability via related party transactions . Their end goal was always SP inclusion which now creates continuous liquidity to turn back on the 10b51 trading plan and unload on passive buyers . Due to the conditions that enabled the above this ain ’ t a gap up it ’ s a supply crisis . Institutions currently own 9095 % of the tradeable float . The actual loose float available is only 1015 million shares . Tomorrow morning three big buyers are hitting a wall of zero supply Short interest is still 12M shares . Many are facing a margin call at the open and must buy to cover . MM were selling calls all week on the rumor . With the AH gap to $ 440 thousands of Dec 19 contracts just went Deep ITM . MM need to buy 2.5M 3M shares to stay delta neutral . The SP500 index funds need to buy roughly 16 million shares approx . $ 7B by Dec 19 . They cant buy yet so arb desks will be buying Monday to warehousefor them . The level of greed is on mars right now because every trading desk is aware of the mechanics and liquidity crunch . Institutions are holding because they know indexes will pay whatever it takes on Dec 18 . Buying demand far outweighs supply . It ’ s hard to say how exactly this plays out but this is stock is crazy and this event is extremely unique . If I had to guess CVNA gaps up 15 % and has the potential to rip higher . I ’ m expecting a high in the 470500 range . Absurd I know but this is the grand finale of one of the greatest marker manipulations in history . It ’ ll be fun to watch tomorrow ."

      "selftext": "Buying VOO and shorting a few stocks is not for me. As the Mag 7 combined are now ~ 35% of S&P500, VOO has become a less diversified investment. As a principle, I don’t like concentration. TSLA ’s valuation in particular is an outlier. Buying VOO and shorting TSLA (or any other) requires margin and the market could stay irrational longer than one can stay solvent. What if I just don’t own it? I found XMAG is an ETF with full replication of S&P493 ( it excludes the Mag 7). Fees are 0.35% so quite more than VOO 0.03% but lower than direct indexing, has no minimum and no headache of transferring assets to another brokerage. It rebalances quarterly. I see one drawback, it’s new and relatively small (67M in assets! ) The bid & ask spread yesterday was a few cents (17 bps). It’s pretty simple to add any of the Mag7 by adding individual stock(s).",

My question is: Given this is 90% of my stock portfolio… what is the strategic thing to do with this? I do believe very strongly that the company will continue to grow and that this stock will grow, but I’m also a bit uncomfortable at the lack of diversity in my portfolio. Do people sell their company’s stock after a year of ownership and reinvest, or just stay the course, or? Just looking for some advice.

I also have about 50k in a 401k account that is invested in an allocated fund. I invest 15% of my paycheck into my 401k which comes to about $620 biweekly. I also invest $300 a week to my Robinhood account which is evenly distributed to each of my holdings. I am curious to know any and all thoughts you all have on my investing direction. I plan to continue this strategy for the rest of my life. Am I behind on where I should be for my age? Should I be investing more? Do you agree with my holding? Should I be more diversified? Will this strategy give me enough for retirement? Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you! Edit: also forgot to mention I am a home owner. My brother and I I own a multi family home that we paid 250k for and we purchased about 2 years ago. Still owe 240k on the mortgage. And I also fully own a car that is a 2015 Mazda Cx5.

      "selftext": "My grandfather retired in 1998 at 48 years old(around when I was born to help out), he had about $75k in an IRA and a pension that covered most of his expenses. He currently has $170k in a Roth IRA. Since then he’s invested only in stocks (no bonds or ETFs), he mostly did short term trades until 5-7 years ago he started long term investing. The last 20 years he withdrew between $15-25k a year to help cover expenses. He’s always talked to me about investing and taught me maybe half of what I know. It helped set me on a really solid path, but I never actually knew how well he did and he never tracked it. But yesterday I finally grew the balls to ask to check his Fidelity account and look at what its performance tracker says, he’s old now and literally didn’t know it had that feature. So over the last 10 years he had annualized returns of 14.2%, the first couple years were a bit harder to gauge since he moved everything from a trad ira to a Roth IRA. But I got it down to 10.7% annualized over 27 years. I see sp500 over that time annualized 9.02%, but the nasdaq (which is his preferred benchmark) is 11-12% I couldn’t get an exact number easily. So he outperformed the sp500 but underperformed the nasdaq. I’d argue he did much better than he likely would have with an advisor (after fees) or even just following the normal 80/20 recommendation. So I think his performance is good. However, I don’t think it was great and likely when risk adjusted significantly underperformed. Curious what others think as everyone here always says “well good luck maintaining that for 30 years” and I never see realistic posts of people’s 30 year return so I figured I’d share a real life example.",

Using Zacks.com’s stock screener, I downloaded all public stocks with: (1) a market cap above $100 billion, (2) an operating margin above 0%, and (3) a sales growth forecast above 0%. This screen gave me 118 stocks (including the Class B shares for GOOG/L). I then put those stocks in a scatter plot to identify the Stars: [Growth Profit Matrix]( With no surprise, the semiconductor stocks NVDA and AVGO were the furthest into the Star region. PLTR, HOOD, LLY and TSM also made the cut. MA, APP and V are examples of high operating margin but lower revenue growth stocks. For my Value Points calculation, I like stocks that have a combined operating margin and projected revenue growth of at least 40 (above the blue line). This could include Stars, Cash Cows and Question Marks. Once I’ve identified the good companies, the next step, of course, is to determine whether they currently are overvalued, undervalued or appropriately priced. We will run that analysis on individual stocks over the coming weeks.",

Using Zacks.com ’ s stock screener I downloaded all public stocks with 1 a market cap above $ 100 billion 2 an operating margin above 0 % and 3 a sales growth forecast above 0 % . This screen gave me 118 stocks including the Class B shares for GOOGL . I then put those stocks in a scatter plot to identify the Stars Growth Profit Matrix With no_surprise the semiconductor stocks NVDA and AVGO were the furthest into the Star region . PLTR HOOD LLY and TSM also made the cut . MA APP and V are examples of high operating margin but lower revenue growth stocks . For my Value Points calculation I like stocks that have a combined operating margin and projected revenue growth of at least 40 above the blue line . This could include Stars Cash Cows and Question Marks . Once I ’ ve identified the good companies the next step of course is to determine whether they currently are overvalued undervalued or appropriately priced . We will run that analysis on individual stocks over the coming weeks ."

      "selftext": "My grandfather retired in 1998 at 48 years old(around when I was born to help out), he had about $75k in an IRA and a pension that covered most of his expenses. He currently has $170k in a Roth IRA. Since then he’s invested only in stocks (no bonds or ETFs), he mostly did short term trades until 5-7 years ago he started long term investing. The last 20 years he withdrew between $15-25k a year to help cover expenses. He’s always talked to me about investing and taught me maybe half of what I know. It helped set me on a really solid path, but I never actually knew how well he did and he never tracked it. But yesterday I finally grew the balls to ask to check his Fidelity account and look at what its performance tracker says, he’s old now and literally didn’t know it had that feature. So over the last 10 years he had annualized returns of 14.2%, the first couple years were a bit harder to gauge since he moved everything from a trad ira to a Roth IRA. But I got it down to 10.7% annualized over 27 years. I see sp500 over that time annualized 9.02%, but the nasdaq (which is his preferred benchmark) is 11-12% I couldn’t get an exact number easily. So he outperformed the sp500 but underperformed the nasdaq. I’d argue he did much better than he likely would have with an advisor (after fees) or even just following the normal 80/20 recommendation. So I think his performance is good. However, I don’t think it was *great* and likely when risk adjusted significantly underperformed. Curious what others think as everyone here always says “well good luck maintaining that for 30 years” and I never see realistic posts of people’s 30 year return so I figured I’d share a real life example.",

      "selftext_processed": "My grandfather retired in 1998 at 48 years oldaround when I was born to help out he had about $ 75k in an IRA and a pension that covered most of his expenses . He currently has $ 170k in a Roth IRA . Since then he ’ s invested only in stocks no bonds or ETFs he mostly did short term trades until 57 years ago he started long term investing . The last 20 years he withdrew between $ 1525k a year to help cover expenses . He ’ s always talked to me about investing and taught me maybe half of what I know . It helped set me on a really solid path but I never_actually knew how well he did and he never_tracked it . But yesterday I finally grew the balls to ask to check his Fidelity account and look at what its performance tracker says he ’ s old now and literally didn ’ t know it had that feature . So over the last 10 years he had annualized returns of 14.2 % the first couple years were a bit harder to gauge since he moved everything from a trad ira to a Roth IRA . But I got it down to 10.7 % annualized over 27 years . I see sp500 over that time annualized 9.02 % but the nasdaq which is his preferred benchmark is 1112 % I couldn ’ t get an exact number easily . So he outperformed the sp500 but underperformed the nasdaq . I ’ d argue he did much better than he likely would have with an advisor after fees or even just following the normal 8020 recommendation . So I think his performance is good . However I don ’ t think it was great and likely when risk adjusted significantly underperformed . Curious what others think as everyone here always says “ well good luck maintaining that for 30 years ” and I never_see realistic posts of people ’ s 30 year return so I figured I ’ d share a real life example ."

      "selftext": "I’m 23 years old. I’ve been in the workforce for 1 year after finishing my degree and I don’t have a good job or a career yet. I’ve recently inherited a little over $1,000,000 AUD. I know there are reasons Australians have to buy a house. The first is you don't have to pay capital gains tax when you sell your Principal Place of Residence (PPOR). The second is that it's the easiest way for a normal person to get access to affordable leverage. Finally, it's a great forced savings mechanism for people without the discipline to save. On the other hand, I feel like most Australian property investors are very emotional about their investments. They see the good performance over the last couple of decades and believe that that tells them anything about the future performance of the asset class. There's also the status associated with owning a home and FOMO about being priced out of owning a home that influences them to buy. Needless to say, emotional investments have rarely made for good investments historically. Stocks seem attractive to me because of the 50 percent CGT discount for long-term holders. If you sell it slowly in retirement you can avoid paying CGT just as with a PPOR. Furthermore, while price to rental yields make purchasing property expensive in Australia right now, stocks don't have this same issue. US stocks are expensive. The average PE ratio is extraordinarily high compared to the past. The current preference of Australian investors to overweight US stocks is probably in part due to the common fallacy of investors to look at past exceptional performance to extrapolate exceptional performance in the future. Emerging market stocks are not, however. The PE ratios are low, and sentiment around EM stocks is pessimistic. They have done poorly the past 2 decades, after all. Meanwhile developing countries particularly in Asia seem to be making progress modernising and see no signs of slowing down. People there are industrious, educated and intelligent while Westerners doing the same jobs are often complacent, entitled, and lazy. So what I'm saying here is that EM stocks, to my eye, are cheap and are a solid bet and that Australian property is overrated and expensive. Is there some argument for Australian property I'm not seeing here? Do the tax benefits of owning AU property trump any potential future outperformance of owning EM stocks instead?",

I ’ ve recently inherited a little over $ 1000000 AUD . I know there are reasons Australians have to buy a house . The first is you dont have to pay capital gains tax when you sell your Principal Place of Residence PPOR . The second is that its the easiest way for a normal person to get access to affordable leverage . Finally its a great forced savings mechanism for people without the discipline to save . On the other hand I feel like most Australian property investors are very emotional about their investments . They see the good performance over the last couple of decades and believe that that tells them anything about the future performance of the asset class . Theres also the status associated with owning a home and FOMO about being priced out of owning a home that influences them to buy . Needless to say emotional investments have rarely made for good investments historically . Stocks seem attractive to me because of the 50 percent CGT discount for longterm holders . If you sell it slowly in retirement you can avoid paying CGT just as with a PPOR . Furthermore while price to rental yields make purchasing property expensive in Australia right now stocks dont have this same issue . US stocks are expensive . The average PE ratio is extraordinarily high compared to the past . The current preference of Australian investors to overweight US stocks is probably in part due to the common fallacy of investors to look at past exceptional performance to extrapolate exceptional performance in the future . Emerging market stocks are not_however . The PE ratios are low and sentiment around EM stocks is pessimistic . They have done poorly the past 2 decades after all . Meanwhile developing countries particularly in Asia seem to be making progress modernising and see no_signs of slowing down . People there are industrious educated and intelligent while Westerners doing the same jobs are often complacent entitled and lazy . So what Im saying here is that EM stocks to my eye are cheap and are a solid bet and that Australian property is overrated and expensive . Is there some argument for Australian property Im not_seeing here Do the tax benefits of owning AU property trump any potential future outperformance of owning EM stocks instead"

      "selftext": "I was born in 1998. My generation hasn’t experienced a serious market drawdown in our adult lifetime. Every asset class has gone up consistently, fueled by massive central bank stimulus quantitative easing (QE) that began in 2008. I can’t help but wonder how brutal the next real crash might be, especially considering that most of us born around the same time and now working in finance with real responsibilities have never lived through one. We just dont know what real f*cking market fear is. The new “truth” seems to be that a 10% annual return in the stock market is guaranteed, and that the risk free rate despite now yielding about the same as the S&P 500 earnings yield is for fools. I feel like freaking Gandalf, sitting in Minas Tirith, reading ancient scrolls about the ring that once existed, that no one believes could return. Except in this case, it’s “stocks can actually fall for long periods”. There was a time when stocks were considered risky, and people understood that. Now I hear friends talk about mutual funds like they’re savings accounts: “10% returns, locked in.” And since we’ve never seen anything close to a long lasting market drawdown with real fear, I can’t even imagine how badly people will panic. Just a few weeks ago, people were already calling for the Fed to step in when the S&P was still at 5000. God, when I look at my friends and our generation, I can’t stand that the only thing left is to hope we actually get a lesson. There’s an ATH of fools running around thinking they’re f*cking George Soros on Main Street. We need a 1929 event, and we need it now. I don’t care if I have to live in a tent",

      "selftext_processed": "I was born in 1998 . My generation hasn ’ t experienced a serious market drawdown in our adult lifetime . Every asset class has gone up consistently fueled by massive central bank stimulus quantitative easing QE that began in 2008 . I can ’ t help but wonder how brutal the next real crash might be especially considering that most of us born around the same time and now working in finance with real responsibilities have never_lived through one . We just dont know what real fcking market fear is . The new “ truth ” seems to be that a 10 % annual return in the stock market is guaranteed and that the risk free rate despite now yielding about the same as the SP 500 earnings yield is for fools . I feel like freaking Gandalf sitting in Minas Tirith reading ancient scrolls about the ring that once existed that no_one believes could return . Except in this case it ’ s “ stocks can actually fall for long periods ” . There was a time when stocks were considered risky and people understood that . Now I hear friends talk about mutual funds like they ’ re savings accounts “ 10 % returns locked in. ” And since we ’ ve never_seen anything close to a long lasting market drawdown with real fear I can ’ t even imagine how badly people will panic . Just a few weeks ago people were already calling for the Fed to step in when the SP was still at 5000 . God when I look at my friends and our generation I can ’ t stand that the only thing left is to hope we actually get a lesson . There ’ s an ATH of fools running around thinking they ’ re fcking George Soros on Main Street . We need a 1929 event and we need it now . I don ’ t care if I have to live in a tent"

According to CNBC, WBD has agreed to sell its studio and streaming business to Netflix, a move that reportedly leaves CEO David Zaslav financially better off but has raised plenty of questions about what WBD shareholders are actually getting out of it. Now, Paramount is said to be considering taking its offer straight to WBD shareholders instead of negotiating solely with management. The logic seems to be that a Paramount deal could have a smoother path through U.S. regulators compared to a full Netflix acquisition. Sources say Paramount was the only bidder willing to go after all of WBD’s assets together the studio, streaming business, and TV networks while Netflix and Comcast were mainly focused on Warner Bros. and HBO Max. At this point it looks like a mix of regulatory risk, deal structure, and shareholder pressure could end up deciding where these assets land. Source:",

My plan is to invest around €500 every few months, with a long-term horizon (10+ years). I’m not looking for quick gains, mainly preservation of value with a reasonable long-term return. I’ve been considering a few options: Physical gold, but many people say it’s not the best idea right now since it’s at an all-time high. An S&P 500 ETF, but I also keep seeing comments that the index is currently “too high” to enter. Some Asian/emerging markets ETFs, but opinions on those are mixed as well. So now I’m a bit stuck, it feels like everything is “not a good idea right now,” which doesn’t make sense if I want to invest regularly. Given today’s market conditions, what would you consider a sensible long-term investment strategy for someone contributing periodically and not trying to time the market?

My brain considers investing as an almost 10% guarantee over a 40 year timespan when I retire, with volatility being ironed out by time in the market, but when you apply that to any of the top individual companies, that 10% annual return gives valuations that my brain can’t comprehend and interprets as ludicrous. Could we really see companies like Apple or Microsoft (or some other company that might take over in the future) or whoever else being valued at 30 trillion in 40 years time? Or is the stock market hitting some unknown limit of size? I believe the stock market will grow more, but when you consider that growth being driven by companies being valued at 10s of trillions, it all seems impossible!",

Could we really see companies like Apple or Microsoft or some other company that might take over in the future or whoever else being valued at 30 trillion in 40 years time Or is the stock market hitting some unknown limit of size I believe the stock market will grow more but when you consider that growth being driven by companies being valued at 10s of trillions it all seems impossible"

      "selftext": "Not investment advice to buy. I own shares. Seems like a classic value unlocking play. Why interesting and boring? Well first of all it’s a conglomerate, hence probably wont explode and isn’t for day trading. Interesting? I’ll explain below. They already spun off the materials business back in Oct 2025. Since then the spinoff went up 3% but Honeywell went down 6%. The big catalyst is coming in 2026 when they seperate Aerospace. Should trade at a higher multiple as a standalone company. Also nobody talks about the quantum stake. They own 54% of Quantinuum. Based on the last valutation their stake is worth like $5B which is basically a free option embedded in the price. Quantum computing might be the next AI play? Maybe? Quantinuum might IPO in 2027. Price targets 230-260 USD. Now at 191. The fundementals seem fair here. Trading around 20x PE with a 2.5% dividend. Cash flow is strong but top line growth is slow. Is this a value trap or a smart sum of parts play. Anyone else buying?",

      "selftext": "I’ve twice previously posted on Verticals valuation; this time I want to focus on their quality. If you go to the investors section of Verticals website, you’ll see many individuals with impressive resumes who are all familiar with senior positions. I’m just going to focus briefly on 3 of the most recent recruits and their most pertinent previous roles. Patrick Ky joined Verticals board at the beginning of September 2025 following 10 years as Executive Director of The European Aviation Safety Agency. The European equivalent of the FAA. Lord Andrew Parker joined the board in June 2025 after serving as Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household, acting as the main channel of communication between the monarch and the House of Lords. This following a long career at MI5 (UK equivalent of FBI) where from 2013 to 2020 he served as Director General. Carsten Stendevad joined in May 2025. He was previously the CEO of ATP, Denmark’s national pension plan. These three people have a couple of things in common. First and chief among them is integrity. These are people whose lives are built upon it. The second is that they are not short of options, and yet Dómhnal Slattery, an aerospace entrepreneur with almost 40 years’ experience was able to cherry pick them for his board. One final thought, how would the market react if the former head of the FAA, the former head of the FBI and the former head of say The Federal Reserve were to join the board of one of Verticals peers?

Lord Andrew Parker joined the board in June 2025 after serving as Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household acting as the main channel of communication between the monarch and the House of Lords .

      "selftext": "This is the second installment of my effort to summarize some stock ideas from the week’s issue of Barron’s Magazine. Do your own due diligence and research. **WY** Weyerhaeuser is a play on lumber prices and the economic cycle. It is down 24% for the year and 33% from the high but this seems to be a trough for both lumber and for WY. If you believe that the current interest cutting cycle of the Fed will spur housing construction over the next 12-24 months, this is a good time to buy. Some down side protection from WY’s 4% dividend yield and significant analyst support, and the fact that WY doesn’t get much credit for the other profitable and growing parts of its business. Article is written by Andrew Bary who is one of Barron’s better stock pickers IMO. **CASY** Casey’s is the #3 convenience store chain in the US, and considered best in class in their distribution network in the Midwest. The impetus for the recommendation is that convenience stores do better during economic tough times, CASY is a superior operator, and is in growth mode with a plan to enter the Texas market with 1000 stores and increase their store count by a third. Not a cheap stock, it trades at a 30x PE and is near an all time high. **FISV** Fiserv is a service provider to the financial industry and has had a terrible year, halving its earnings forecast earlier this year citing deteriorating conditions in Argentina as a reason for its problems. It trades for a reasonable P/E of 10. Heavy insider buying is the reason Barron’s has highlighted FISV. A companion piece on the 10 worst performing S&P500 stocks in 2025 includes FISV (and names Chipotle (CMG) as the best bounce-back candidate). **AAPL** Two items about Apple this week. First, Apple may be the ultimate winner of the AI game because it has not had to spend any capital on its development. If you believe that AI will eventually be a commodity, then Apple may have made the smartest play by using other companies and hyperscalers (rumored to be Google Gemini) to be its supplier rather than investing hundreds of billions into its development. Second, Apple has a hit with the iPhone 17 but it also is currently killing it in growing services revenue, an analyst says. $300 price target.",

      "selftext_processed": "This is the second installment of my effort to summarize some stock ideas from the week ’ s issue of Barron ’ s Magazine . Do your own due diligence and research . WY Weyerhaeuser is a play on lumber prices and the economic cycle . It is down 24 % for the year and 33 % from the high but this seems to be a trough for both lumber and for WY . If you believe that the current interest cutting cycle of the Fed will spur housing construction over the next 1224 months this is a good time to buy . Some down side protection from WY ’ s 4 % dividend yield and significant analyst support and the fact that WY doesn ’ t get much credit for the other profitable and growing parts of its business . Article is written by Andrew Bary who is one of Barron ’ s better stock pickers IMO . CASY Casey ’ s is the 3 convenience store chain in the US and considered best in class in their distribution network in the Midwest . The impetus for the recommendation is that convenience stores do better during economic tough times CASY is a superior operator and is in growth mode with a plan to enter the Texas market with 1000 stores and increase their store count by a third . Not_a cheap stock it trades at a 30x PE and is near an all time high . FISV Fiserv is a service provider to the financial industry and has had a terrible year halving its earnings forecast earlier this year citing deteriorating conditions in Argentina as a reason for its problems . It trades for a reasonable PE of 10 . Heavy insider buying is the reason Barron ’ s has highlighted FISV . A companion piece on the 10 worst performing SP500 stocks in 2025 includes FISV and names Chipotle CMG as the best bounceback candidate . AAPL Two items about Apple this week . First Apple may be the ultimate winner of the AI game because it has not_had to spend any capital on its development . If you believe that AI will eventually be a commodity then Apple may have made the smartest play by using other companies and hyperscalers rumored to be Google Gemini to be its supplier rather than investing hundreds of billions into its development . Second Apple has a hit with the iPhone 17 but it also is currently killing it in growing services revenue an analyst says . $ 300 price target ."

I have made around 4k over 2025 by doing it and learning more with it. My question is would it be smarter for me to just be investing my money into a roth ira at this age and letting it build over time or just keep doing what i’m doing and push for an earlier retirement through a taxable account, i contribute about 10-12k a year into my taxable account and the amount i’ll invest each year will go up as I get older",

Today completely different picture, Google dominates AI with Gemini and their own hardware, and some believe they have the potential to crush the competition. Everytime a major announcement regarding an LLM is released stocks move - but what is the financial basis of this, is it justified or an overreactiin. Is there a financially rational basis for it? What is your opinion, is there room for growth for all Mag7 especially Amazon, Microsoft, Meta at the same pace or will one of them dominate the others? What is the most realistic scenario for you?

Today completely different picture Google dominates AI with Gemini and their own hardware and some believe they have the potential to crush the competition . Everytime a major announcement regarding an LLM is released stocks move but what is the financial basis of this is it justified or an overreactiin . Is there a financially rational basis for it What is your opinion is there room for growth for all Mag7 especially Amazon Microsoft Meta at the same pace or will one of them dominate the others What is the most realistic scenario for you PS sorry for my bad English at least you know its not_written with chatgpt"

And more importantly I have to say history is not an indicator of the future and as many people have been saying for the past few years, we are due for a pullback.. That pullback may come today or in 5 years. No one knows. The skeptic in me believes while maybe the trend can continue, you never know who will continue their growth, who will falter, who will be the next big thing, who will ink big deals, who will run out of money, who's tech will become superior/inferior, etc. All that to say maybe a tech etf will be safer than choosing the wrong stocks. And s&p is safer than those.

About a year and a half ago my ex, who was very abusive, filed an online report saying I was selling weed after I finally left her. I’m in Texas, so the cops went all in. They arrested me, searched my house, took all my electronics and paperwork, and even towed both of my cars and ripped through them. The only “drugs” they found were legal CBD gummies and a couple of CBD drinks I bought from a shop by a college, and I had receipts for everything. Their own field test and then the lab both came back with no THC. I was never charged with anything. They still tried to take my stuff using civil forfeiture, so I hired a lawyer and spent around 50k fighting it. That case is now over. All my property has been returned and there are no charges and no open criminal cases against me. During the investigation, one cop sent a generic “this person is under investigation” email to all my banks and to Robinhood. It was not a court order, not a levy, nothing that said “freeze this account.” All of my banks and credit card companies ignored it. Only Robinhood decided to lock my brokerage account. The account is around 160k, mostly in three big stocks I’ve held since the COVID crash. Since then, the police and the city attorney have put in writing that there is no hold, no lien, no legal freeze, and that they don’t plan to go after my Robinhood funds at all. They’ve looked at the original email and basically said Robinhood misread it and treated it like something it isn’t. Robinhood has kept the account frozen for more than 18 months now. Every time I contact support, I get the same copy-paste answer about “our team is reviewing this, we can’t give a timeline.” I’ve filed complaints with regulators. The lawyer who handled the forfeiture case has a hearing on the 15th where he’s going to ask a judge to officially say there was never any freeze or lien, but he doesn’t really know Robinhood/FINRA stuff and I don’t have money for a second lawyer. Meanwhile I’m sitting on credit card debt and money I owe family while my savings are locked. Can Robinhood legally keep my account frozen this long when there’s no court order, no lien, and no seizure according to the city attorney and police, or is this something I can realistically take to arbitration or court and expect to win? What legal steps, if any, actually exist to force them to act instead of just sending the same “under review” response? For the hearing on the 15th, I don’t even know what my lawyer should be asking the judge for beyond some kind of order clearly saying there was never any freeze or lien and nothing on the government side stopping Robinhood from releasing my funds. I’ve also wondered if it’s even possible for a judge to order the police or city to send some kind of “release” email when the police are saying there was never a freeze in the first place. If I do end up in arbitration or a lawsuit, I’d like to know whether there’s any realistic chance of getting extra damages for how long this has gone on and the financial mess it’s caused, or if it usually just ends with the account finally being opened. And I’d really appreciate guidance on what type of lawyer actually handles this kind of Robinhood/FINRA situation and how to find one who knows what they’re doing.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m posting from a throwaway because this whole thing has been a nightmare and I don ’ t want it tied back to my main . About a year and a half ago my ex who was very abusive filed an online report saying I was selling weed after I finally left her . I ’ m in Texas so the cops went all in . They arrested me searched my house took all my electronics and paperwork and even towed both of my cars and ripped through them . The only “ drugs ” they found were legal CBD gummies and a couple of CBD drinks I bought from a shop by a college and I had receipts for everything . Their own field test and then the lab both came back with no_THC . I was never_charged with anything . They still tried to take my stuff using civil forfeiture so I hired a lawyer and spent around 50k fighting it . That case is now over . All my property has been returned and there are no_charges and no_open criminal cases against me . During the investigation one cop sent a generic “ this person is under investigation ” email to all my banks and to Robinhood . It was not_a court order not_a levy nothing_that said “ freeze this account. ” All of my banks and credit card companies ignored it . Only Robinhood decided to lock my brokerage account . The account is around 160k mostly in three big stocks I ’ ve held since the COVID crash . Since then the police and the city attorney have put in writing that there is no_hold no_lien no_legal freeze and that they don ’ t plan to go after my Robinhood funds at all . They ’ ve looked at the original email and basically said Robinhood misread it and treated it like something it isn ’ t . Robinhood has kept the account frozen for more than 18 months now . Every time I contact support I get the same copypaste answer about “ our team is reviewing this we can ’ t give a timeline. ” I ’ ve filed complaints with regulators . The lawyer who handled the forfeiture case has a hearing on the 15th where he ’ s going to ask a judge to officially say there was never_any freeze or lien but he doesn ’ t really know RobinhoodFINRA stuff and I don ’ t have money for a second lawyer . Meanwhile I ’ m sitting on credit card debt and money I owe family while my savings are locked . Can Robinhood legally keep my account frozen this long when there ’ s no_court order no_lien and no_seizure according to the city attorney and police or is this something I can realistically take to arbitration or court and expect to win What legal steps if any actually exist to force them to act instead of just sending the same “ under review ” response For the hearing on the 15th I don ’ t even know what my lawyer should be asking the judge for beyond some kind of order clearly saying there was never_any freeze or lien and nothing_on the government side stopping Robinhood from releasing my funds . I ’ ve also wondered if it ’ s even possible for a judge to order the police or city to send some kind of “ release ” email when the police are saying there was never_a freeze in the first place . If I do end up in arbitration or a lawsuit I ’ d like to know whether there ’ s any realistic chance of getting extra damages for how long this has gone on and the financial mess it ’ s caused or if it usually just ends with the account finally being opened . And I ’ d really appreciate guidance on what type of lawyer actually handles this kind of RobinhoodFINRA situation and how to find one who knows what they ’ re doing ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m 23 years old, earning €1,500 per month. I’ve been investing €235 monthly for the last 4 months. My goal is to keep this amount until I build a savings buffer that I personally feel comfortable with, and then increase my monthly contributions. For context, I already have an emergency fund equal to 6 months of my salary. My current portfolio allocation is: • 85% VWCE • 15% IBIT I want to keep at least 5% IBIT long-term, and I want VWCE to remain my core holding. However, since I’m still young, I’m considering adding a technology ETF or possibly a semiconductor ETF for higher growth potential. If you have a better strategy in mind that fits my profile, feel free to suggest it. Additional info: • My country has no capital gains tax on stocks/ETFs. • I’m currently investing through Trading212, but I plan to move to IBKR once my portfolio reaches a certain size. All opinions and advice are welcome.",

      "selftext": "I have spent the last year working on tools that helps investors do research quickly and understand their own portfolios. Here's some observations on what people say they'll do and what they actually do when the markets get choppy or goes sideways. 1. **The \"I'll buy the dip\" crowd that never does** Everyone has a plan until the markets drop 10%. Then suddenly that cash on the sidelines stay on the sidelines. Even worse is that some sell at the bottom and convince that they will get back in when everything stabilize. They rarely do. The investors who actually benefit from volatility are the ones who automate their buying or have rules they stick to **2. Checking Portfolios way too often** There is some good research on this already and some of you may already aware of it, but watching it in practice is something else. The folks who check daily usually tend to make more changes. More changes usually means worse returns. The one's who check monthly or quarterly tend to be better at riding out the noise and end up better off. **3. Confusing narrative with strategy** \"AI is the future\" is NOT a portfolio strategy. Neither is \"The dollar is collapsing\" or \"real estate always goes up\" or something is a bubble etc. The investors that actually do well tend to have actual rules for allocation, percentages, a thesis, exit strategy etc. The ones chasing themes tend to buy high, panic sell at lows and end up worse than they'd just held a boring index fund. None of this is new, but seeing it play out at our analysis repeatedly made it real in a way that reading about it never did. What behavioral traps have you caught yourself falling into ?",

Heres some observations on what people say theyll do and what they actually do when the markets get choppy or goes sideways . 1 . The Ill buy the dip crowd that never_does Everyone has a plan until the markets drop 10 % . Then suddenly that cash on the sidelines stay on the sidelines . Even worse is that some sell at the bottom and convince that they will get back in when everything stabilize . They rarely do . The investors who actually benefit from volatility are the ones who automate their buying or have rules they stick to 2 . Checking Portfolios way too often There is some good research on this already and some of you may already aware of it but watching it in practice is something else . The folks who check daily usually tend to make more changes . More changes usually means worse returns . The ones who check monthly or quarterly tend to be better at riding out the noise and end up better off . 3 . Confusing narrative with strategy AI is the future is NOT_a portfolio strategy . Neither_is The dollar is collapsing or real estate always goes up or something is a bubble etc . The investors that actually do well tend to have actual rules for allocation percentages a thesis exit strategy etc . The ones chasing themes tend to buy high panic sell at lows and end up worse than theyd just held a boring index fund . None of this is new but seeing it play out at our analysis repeatedly made it real in a way that reading about it never_did . What behavioral traps have you caught yourself falling into"

      "selftext": "I’ve been taking time off work and during the break I’ve been trying to understand money and investing a bit more deeply, beyond the usual “buy stocks, buy index funds” talking points. Something I keep coming back to is the way interest rates and markets interact. We’re living in a time where interest rates are generally quite low (with some spikes here and there recently), and inflation is mostly kept under control. But if you look back a few decades, high interest rates (double digits) weren’t unusual at all. It made me wonder: are low rates simply the new normal because of how modern economies are structured? Or is this just another phase in a longer cycle? And when interest rates stay low, the money tends to flow into equities and indexes like the S&P 500. Over long stretches, the S&P has massively outperformed other investment avenues from GIC/Precious Metals/Bank Savings, depending on the timeframe you choose. I’m trying to understand if that’s purely because of real economic growth and innovation, or if low rates artificially push valuations up. I’m definitely not saying the S&P is a Ponzi (it clearly represents real companies), but the way it keeps going up almost nonstop made me wonder if there’s a point where the growth stalls, like for ex, what happened to Japan’s Nikkei after its massive boom. So my question is basically: Is the long-term rise of the S&P 500 mostly driven by productivity and innovation, or by monetary policy and liquidity? And if the latter, what happens when liquidity can’t expand forever? Could we ever see a long sideways/down market like Japan, or are the situations too different to compare? I’m just trying to understand how money actually works in the big picture, so any explanation or reading material would be appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been taking time off work and during the break I ’ ve been trying to understand money and investing a bit more deeply beyond the usual “ buy stocks buy index funds ” talking points . Something I keep coming back to is the way interest rates and markets interact . We ’ re living in a time where interest rates are generally quite low with some spikes here and there recently and inflation is mostly kept under control . But if you look back a few decades high interest rates double digits weren ’ t unusual at all . It made me wonder are low rates simply the new normal because of how modern economies are structured Or is this just another phase in a longer cycle And when interest rates stay low the money tends to flow into equities and indexes like the SP 500 . Over long stretches the SP has massively outperformed other investment avenues from GICPrecious MetalsBank Savings depending on the timeframe you choose . I ’ m trying to understand if that ’ s purely because of real economic growth and innovation or if low rates artificially push valuations up . I ’ m definitely not_saying the SP is a Ponzi it clearly represents real companies but the way it keeps going up almost nonstop made me wonder if there ’ s a point where the growth stalls like for ex what happened to Japan ’ s Nikkei after its massive boom . So my question is basically Is the longterm rise of the SP 500 mostly driven by productivity and innovation or by monetary policy and liquidity And if the latter what happens when liquidity can ’ t expand forever Could we ever see a long sidewaysdown market like Japan or are the situations too different to compare I ’ m just trying to understand how money actually works in the big picture so any explanation or reading material would be appreciated ."

      "selftext": "Say the Warner Bros deal actually closes, Netflix would effectively win the streaming wars along with YouTube. But winning the streaming wars & doing a transformative M&A deal doesn't mean the stock will go up. Using two examples: Disney acquired Fox for $71 billion & Comcast acquired Sky for $39 billion. Both acquisitions made Disney+ & Peacock more competitive, but both stocks have failed to provide shareholder value over the past 5 years. Disney is down 32% Comcast is down 47% I 100% agree that both companies did strengthen their streaming platforms (Disney+ and Peacock), but none of that translated into shareholder value. Scale improved. Market share improved. Financial performance did not. Megadeals can help the platform, but there is no track record in recent history that it helps the stock. Netflix is facing a similar dynamic. Expect 12 - 18 months of purgatory as they close the deal through regulatory scrutiny. The DoJ striking this deal down could actually help Netflix stock. Debt load will increase dramatically and cash flow will be used to cover interest + debt payments Even if Netflix “wins the deal,” the stock could be stuck in the same 5-year malaise Disney and Comcast experienced after their megamergers. The market rewards operating leverage which is why Netflix outperformed Disney/Comcast in the past 5 years, not media conglomerate complexity. Curious what others think: Does Netflix escape the Disney/Comcast trap or are we about to watch the same movie again?",

But winning the streaming wars doing a transformative MA deal doesnt mean the stock will go up . Using two examples Disney acquired Fox for $ 71 billion Comcast acquired Sky for $ 39 billion . Both acquisitions made Disney Peacock more competitive but both stocks have failed to provide shareholder value over the past 5 years . Disney is down 32 % Comcast is down 47 % I 100 % agree that both companies did strengthen their streaming platforms Disney and Peacock but none of that translated into shareholder value . Scale improved . Market share improved . Financial performance did not_Megadeals can help the platform but there is no_track record in recent history that it helps the stock . Netflix is facing a similar dynamic . Expect 12 18 months of purgatory as they close the deal through regulatory scrutiny . The DoJ striking this deal down could actually help Netflix stock . Debt load will increase dramatically and cash flow will be used to cover interest debt payments Even if Netflix “ wins the deal ” the stock could be stuck in the same 5year malaise Disney and Comcast experienced after their megamergers . The market rewards operating leverage which is why Netflix outperformed DisneyComcast in the past 5 years not_media conglomerate complexity . Curious what others think Does Netflix escape the DisneyComcast trap or are we about to watch the same movie again"

      "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway had a pretty interesting run this year, especially around the time Warren Buffett announced he would step down as CEO at the end of the year. Before that surprise in early May, BRK.B was actually beating the S&P 500 by a wide margin outperformance of over 22 percentage points in 2025. That changed quickly after the announcement. Over the next three months, the stock slid nearly 15% to a low around $459 in early August. Since then, it’s bounced back about 10% and now sits near $504, putting it up roughly 11% for the year. The problem is the broader market hasn’t slowed down. The S&P 500 is up almost 38% since its April low and nearly 17% year-to-date, closing just a few points below its all-time high. Even with Berkshire’s rebound, it hasn’t been able to catch up with that pace. Feels like a year where the market is rewarding risk and momentum more than steady, conservative names. Curious how others see Berkshire here long-term hold as usual, or starting to fall behind in this kind of market? Source:",

      "selftext_processed": "Berkshire Hathaway had a pretty interesting run this year especially around the time Warren Buffett announced he would step down as CEO at the end of the year . Before that surprise in early May BRK.B was actually beating the SP 500 by a wide margin outperformance of over 22 percentage points in 2025 . That changed quickly after the announcement . Over the next three months the stock slid nearly 15 % to a low around $ 459 in early August . Since then it ’ s bounced back about 10 % and now sits near $ 504 putting it up roughly 11 % for the year . The problem is the broader market hasn ’ t slowed down . The SP 500 is up almost 38 % since its April low and nearly 17 % yeartodate closing just a few points below its alltime high . Even with Berkshire ’ s rebound it hasn ’ t been able to catch up with that pace . Feels like a year where the market is rewarding risk and momentum more than steady conservative names . Curious how others see Berkshire here longterm hold as usual or starting to fall behind in this kind of market Source"

I know The medallion fund was 66% a year, however they still had the restrains of having a large amount of money to move around. So if they were trading individual accounts it probably could have been 100% a year or more potentially. So I want to see if anyone has any idea. I'm thinking 70-120% range",

      "selftext": "In the history of human economic relations, wealth and power have always had only two sources: a) you hold a resource others depend on; b) you hold an instrument of someone's obligation (others owe you) Whoever holds the key to someone else’s dependence is free. Whoever depends on others is a slave. Quite simple. If you hold oil, grain, or electricity, people and companies must come to you and pay you to drive their vehicles, feed themselves, or heat their homes and factories. Without that resource, their normal functioning stops. If you hold most apartments in a city where there is not enough housing, individuals and families must pay you rent or the purchase price, often handing over a large part of their income for decades. Without access to an apartment, they cannot normally live and work in that city. If you hold supermarket gift cards, airline \"miles,\" casino chips, or shares in a company, the issuers owe you goods, services, cash, dividends, or liquidation proceeds. If you hold dollars or euros, bank debtors must come to you or they will lose their house or factory, and the state will be unable to pay its bonds. This is because that money is created through bank loans. Every person with a mortgage must bring that money to the bank to get the lien removed from their house. Every company with a loan must bring it to get the lien removed from its factory. Every state with bonds must bring it to avoid bankruptcy. That is why millions of people work, sell, and beg just to obtain those same dollars or euros and close their loans. You, who hold that money, don't have to do anything. Others work for you. In all these examples, you possess leverage over others: people must come to you, beg you, work for you, or bring you something to get what they need or to get rid of their obligations. Bitcoin gives you none of that. It gives you neither a physical nor a systemic resource on which the functioning of others depends (as with energy, housing, or dollars). There is no issuer who owes you anything (as with stocks, casino chips, or gift cards). In short, Bitcoin does not give you control over others. Instead, it gives you control over a number in a shared database. To obtain that \"number,\" you had to give up things that gave you real power: other people's obligations, other people's dependence, other people's fear of being left without what you control. The moment you traded that power for Bitcoin, you traded leverage for emptiness. You no longer have anything that others depend on. All that remains is the naked hope that the market will voluntarily accept your number. In other words: before, others had to come to you; now you have to beg them. Before, you held an instrument that was someone else's obligation or the key to their functioning. Now you have thrown it away and are left with a number that obliges no one to anything. You gave up power and received pure dependence. That is why all the talk of \"digital gold,\" \"sovereignty,\" and \"financial freedom\" is just a marketing trick. True freedom and sovereignty exist only when others depend on you, when you hold something without which they cannot function or something that obliges them to do something for you. With Bitcoin it is the opposite: you are the one who depends on other people's acceptance, on other people's will. That is not liberation; it is a voluntary entry into slavery.",

Whoever depends on others is a slave . Quite simple . If you hold oil grain or electricity people and companies must come to you and pay you to drive their vehicles feed themselves or heat their homes and factories . Without that resource their normal functioning stops . If you hold most apartments in a city where there is not_enough housing individuals and families must pay you rent or the purchase price often handing over a large part of their income for decades . Without access to an apartment they can not normally live and work in that city . If you hold supermarket gift cards airline miles casino chips or shares in a company the issuers owe you goods services cash dividends or liquidation proceeds . If you hold dollars or euros bank debtors must come to you or they will lose their house or factory and the state will be unable to pay its bonds . This is because that money is created through bank loans . Every person with a mortgage must bring that money to the bank to get the lien removed from their house . Every company with a loan must bring it to get the lien removed from its factory . Every state with bonds must bring it to avoid bankruptcy . That is why millions of people work sell and beg just to obtain those same dollars or euros and close their loans . You who hold that money dont have to do anything . Others work for you . In all these examples you possess leverage over others people must come to you beg you work for you or bring you something to get what they need or to get rid of their obligations . Bitcoin gives you none of that . It gives you neither_a physical nor a systemic resource on which the functioning of others depends as with energy housing or dollars . There is no_issuer who owes you anything as with stocks casino chips or gift cards . In short Bitcoin does not_give you control over others . Instead it gives you control over a number in a shared database . To obtain that number you had to give up things that gave you real power other peoples obligations other peoples dependence other peoples fear of being left without what you control . The moment you traded that power for Bitcoin you traded leverage for emptiness . You no_longer have anything that others depend on . All that remains is the naked hope that the market will voluntarily accept your number . In other words before others had to come to you now you have to beg them . Before you held an instrument that was someone elses obligation or the key to their functioning . Now you have thrown it away and are left with a number that obliges no_one to anything . You gave up power and received pure dependence . That is why all the talk of digital gold sovereignty and financial freedom is just a marketing trick . True freedom and sovereignty exist only when others depend on you when you hold something without which they can not function or something that obliges them to do something for you . With Bitcoin it is the opposite you are the one who depends on other peoples acceptance on other peoples will . That is not_liberation it is a voluntary entry into slavery ."

      "title": "Puts vs. inverse ETFs? A one year update on MSTR",
      "selftext": "A year ago on Saturday, December 7, 2024, [I joined the chorus of skeptics in calling bullshit on MSTR]( which had closed the previous Friday (December 6, 2024) at 395.01. As I was 100% convinced it would go down, I wanted to figure how to establish a bearish position. Unfortunately, as a long-only investor, I had no experience in doing this, so I thought asked this subreddit how best to achieve this exposure. * Most of the posters called me crazy. * Some agreed with my thesis but advised me not to pursue this: they were right. * Some thought MSTR would continue to moon. * Some suggested inverse ETFs. * Some suggested puts. Ultimately, I decided to sit this out. However, so that I could be prepared the next time an opportunity presented itself, I decided to follow the outcomes of various strategies I would have considered. As you probably know, being bearish on a stock not only requires that you are directionally correct, but that you are on point with the timing as well because you otherwise get gaped by exorbitant interest (with shorts), volatility decay (with inverse ETFs), or theta decay (with options). To make sure I didn't cherry pick the perfect time points, I chose **exactly one year** (12/7/24 to 12/6/25) for each of these securities. For the put options, I chose one- and two-year January dated expirations with round numbers (all initial prices adjusted for reverse splits). Note that the specific options denoted in asterisk have extremely low volumes: |Ticker|Strategy|Position|Initial|Current|% Change| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |[MSTR](|Underlying Stock|Long|395.01|178.99|(-54.69%)| |[MSTZ](|2x Inverse ETF|Short|19.06|13.02|(-31.69%)| |[SMST](|2x Inverse ETF|Short|113.00|71.24|(-36.96%)| |[MSTR260116P00300000](|Jan 2026 300p|Short|104.02|121.27|\\+16.58%| |[MSTR260116P00250000\\*](|Jan 2026 250p|Short|74.30|72.81|(-2.01%)| |[MSTR260116P00200000](|Jan 2026 200p|Short|49.65|30.71|(-38.15%)| |[MSTR270115P00300000](|Jan 2027 300p|Short|132.00|144.05|\\+9.13%| |[MSTR270115P00250000\\*](|Jan 2027 250p|Short|98.80|100.00|\\+1.21%| |[MSTR270115P00200000\\*](|Jan 2027 200p|Short|69.09|67.20|(-2.74%)| As you can see, I was **spectacularly right** that the price of MSTR would plummet. MSTR bagholders have had a miserable time (-55%). However, I would have also lost about 1/3 of my principle with inverse ETFs MSTZ or SMST, as they naturally \"sell low\" and \"buy high\" (the basis of their volatility decay). Note that even though MSTR has fallen below the strike price for all the options, the less initially OTM put options (300p) would have been positive whereas the 200p would have been in the red. **\"Why don't you short it?\"** In the end, it pretty much never makes sense to short a stock, even one that is completely garbage. You get an average of 11% per year with much less risk just for indexing (which requires no conviction), >20% in recent years. If you really have the ability to generate alpha--as one must suppose to justify a short position--you can presumably get much higher than >20% annual returns.",

As I was 100 % convinced it would go down I wanted to figure how to establish a bearish position . Unfortunately as a longonly investor I had no_experience in doing this so I thought asked this subreddit how best to achieve this exposure . Most of the posters called me crazy . Some agreed with my thesis but advised me not_to pursue this they were right . Some thought MSTR would continue to moon . Some suggested inverse ETFs . Some suggested puts . Ultimately I decided to sit this out . However so that I could be prepared the next time an opportunity presented itself I decided to follow the outcomes of various strategies I would have considered . As you probably know being bearish on a stock not_only requires that you are directionally correct but that you are on point with the timing as well because you otherwise get gaped by exorbitant interest with shorts volatility decay with inverse ETFs or theta decay with options . To make sure I didnt cherry pick the perfect time points I chose exactly one year 12724 to 12625 for each of these securities . For the put options I chose one and twoyear January dated expirations with round numbers all initial prices adjusted for reverse splits .

MSTR bagholders have had a miserable time 55 % . However I would have also lost about 13 of my principle with inverse ETFs MSTZ or SMST as they naturally sell low and buy high the basis of their volatility decay . Note that even though MSTR has fallen below the strike price for all the options the less initially OTM put options 300p would have been positive whereas the 200p would have been in the red . Why dont you short it In the end it pretty much never_makes sense to short a stock even one that is completely garbage . You get an average of 11 % per year with much less risk just for indexing which requires no_conviction 20 % in recent years . If you really have the ability to generate alphaas one must suppose to justify a short positionyou can presumably get much higher than 20 % annual returns ."

It really works so I was wondering if anyone in here did/does it? I plan on using NTSX as my base. At its core, return stacking is the idea of layering one investment return on top of another to achieve more than $1.00 of exposure for every $1.00 invested. This is typically done to maintain core portfolio exposure (like stocks and bonds) while simultaneously introducing new, diversifying return streams (like managed futures or other alternative strategies).",

      "title": "Controversial Take as a Stock Trader",
      "selftext": "The general Financial wisdom is to invest in index funds and never touch it, even more specifically the S&P 500 as it has outperformed 90% of all individual stocks in about 85% of all hedge funds and 75% of all asset classes including creating your own business which requires your own work and labor. This is why the S&P 500 is the absolute golden standard for all investments and asset classes, period. While all of this may be true, there is something that still needs to be considered: When the market valuations are reaching levels of pre Great depression and levels of peak 2007, it is foolish to sit there and pretend like nothing is wrong and just keep passively investing. The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. That is true and generally speaking with that strategy you should just keep investing when the market is expensive, however, there is a point where expensive becomes ludicrous. The markets are at the ludicrous level and although they might keep pushing up for another 6 months to 2 years at Max, the coming recession is seeming to be a everything bubble and will likely drop markets by 50% or more and if the government and the Federal reserve try to prevent a 50% decline, The US dollar will devalue dramatically. In this current predicament, I would not say that it is wise to ignore the ludicrous levels of the market and just keep dollar cost averaging. If you were to buy in 2007 or pre- Great depression you would have been sitting on a almost 20 to 25-year wait to break even inflation adjusted with the S&P 500. And for the Great depression, it was somewhere around 40 to 50 years just to break even. So in essence you are saying that you are willing to take the risk of 20-40 years waiting for the reward of at most 2 years. This is completely insane and is putting your head in the ground ignoring what is going on. According to all the data and statistics that I have seen as a stock trader, it seems that the market is indeed likely to keep going higher for at least 3 months if not 9 months, but somewhere around the 6 to 9 months from now is a very strong sell signal and I would recommend selling everything and swapping into foreign bonds, not US bonds for reasons I can discuss later, as well as gold but keeping in mind that gold does start to drop about mid recession. So when the recession begins you want to sell your gold as it is up and then have the rest of your money and bonds or short positions. After a substantial decline my goal is buy at -20%, then -35% then near -50% is when you can allocate your capital to great growth companies that will have large returns after the recession. Please do not be foolish and ignore the obvious economic and Market signals that are flashing danger for the long term. PS. My average annualized percent gain is 50%. Try getting that in an index fund",

      "selftext_processed": "The general Financial wisdom is to invest in index funds and never_touch it even more specifically the SP 500 as it has outperformed 90 % of all individual stocks in about 85 % of all hedge funds and 75 % of all asset classes including creating your own business which requires your own work and labor . This is why the SP 500 is the absolute golden standard for all investments and asset classes period . While all of this may be true there is something that still needs to be considered When the market valuations are reaching levels of pre Great depression and levels of peak 2007 it is foolish to sit there and pretend like nothing_is wrong and just keep passively investing . The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent . That is true and generally speaking with that strategy you should just keep investing when the market is expensive however there is a point where expensive becomes ludicrous . The markets are at the ludicrous level and although they might keep pushing up for another 6 months to 2 years at Max the coming recession is seeming to be a everything bubble and will likely drop markets by 50 % or more and if the government and the Federal reserve try to prevent a 50 % decline The US dollar will devalue dramatically . In this current predicament I would not_say that it is wise to ignore the ludicrous levels of the market and just keep dollar cost averaging . If you were to buy in 2007 or pre Great depression you would have been sitting on a almost 20 to 25year wait to break even inflation adjusted with the SP 500 . And for the Great depression it was somewhere around 40 to 50 years just to break even . So in essence you are saying that you are willing to take the risk of 2040 years waiting for the reward of at most 2 years . This is completely insane and is putting your head in the ground ignoring what is going on . According to all the data and statistics that I have seen as a stock trader it seems that the market is indeed likely to keep going higher for at least 3 months if not_9 months but somewhere around the 6 to 9 months from now is a very strong sell signal and I would recommend selling everything and swapping into foreign bonds not_US bonds for reasons I can discuss later as well as gold but keeping in mind that gold does start to drop about mid recession . So when the recession begins you want to sell your gold as it is up and then have the rest of your money and bonds or short positions . After a substantial decline my goal is buy at 20 % then 35 % then near 50 % is when you can allocate your capital to great growth companies that will have large returns after the recession . Please do not_be foolish and ignore the obvious economic and Market signals that are flashing danger for the long term . PS . My average annualized percent gain is 50 % . Try getting that in an index fund"

      "title": "Google - not AMD - is Nvidia’s greatest threat because of their full-stack AI and AlphaEvolve",
      "selftext": "AMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else, but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company’s conception. Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000: \"Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we had the ultimate search engine, it would understand everything on the web; it would understand, um, you know, exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. And that's obviously artificial intelligence.\"[ Google Co-Founder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI (2000)]( \\- For those that don’t know, it was supposedly Larry Page’s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI. # Full-stack AI Now, imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation. Your first thought will probably be: Which should I pick? ChatGPT immediately comes to mind, but you want to do your research properly. Through your research, you find that Google's Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck, at least among American AI models. Plus, they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model. Perfect. Google seems like a good choice. Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity (especially if they improve). But what about implementation? Google offers enterprise-ready API:s via Vertex with more features coming like auth, database and payments, Google Cloud for storage, and now even at location TPU:s that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible. Super. Suddenly, your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google, and along the way, you never touch an Nvidia product. But before you make your final decision, you ask yourself: Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term, so I don’t get vendor-locked with an inferior offering? I’ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never want to bet against the man - and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way. I don’t imagine Nvidia is particularly - or really at all - threatened by Google in the short term, though Google's TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices, reducing profit margin. Apparently, OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it, according to[ Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis]( worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia. Though what is actually important is not the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future. # AlphaEvolve I allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed[ AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms]( The evolutionary AI system had, in secret, improved everything from the training of their AI models to Google's hardware, i.e., their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multi-billion dollar deal for them, with Meta considering the same. The remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro, not even Gemini 2.5. Today, it’s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations, and in the future, it will use far more powerful models than that. Meaning that the better Google’s AI models get, the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google’s models and hardware. The cheaper and better Google’s hardware, the more powerful models can be built and run. The more powerful the models, the better the hardware. And so on. Better AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia’s CUDA moat. One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code, causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA. But once AI models become sufficiently advanced, the programming difficulty may not be a concern, or Google and Gemini create some CUDA-variant of their own. Rumors also exist of them doing just that. # All in all This means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business, it’s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia. If they do it often enough, AI labs will eventually wonder: can you build better AI models without Nvidia? This will be especially true if other AI-labs do it too:[ “resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs”]( Does this mean I think Nvidia is done for? Not at all, as I said, I've spent enough time studying Jensen that I'd never want to bet against him. After all, he is a man who roommated with a 17-year-old ex-con covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5-trillion-dollar man. Jensen has a ton of cards to play, and he’s already playing them perfectly. Nvidia still has a hardware/hardware-software lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future. If they make a substantial compute leap, Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia’s AI lab, absorb one of the AI labs, or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race. He is securing long-term deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia. Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development. He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem. Nvidia will likely begin to offer full-stack solutions of its own. And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia, Google and AMD. **Disclaimer:** I hold a significant long position in Google (Alphabet). The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not constitute financial or investment advice. Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions. **TLDR;** Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term, though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin. But over the long term, Google’s full stack offerings - AI models/applications, cloud and TPUs - with AI model’s designed to improve AI models and hardware (AlphaEvolve) getting better, Google might even take a long term lead. Though, Jensen is playing Nvidia’s cards perfectly.",

      "selftext_processed": "AMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company ’ s conception . Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000 Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google . So we had the ultimate search engine it would understand everything on the web it would understand um you know exactly what you wanted and it would give you the right thing . And thats obviously artificial intelligence . Google CoFounder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI 2000 For those that don ’ t know it was supposedly Larry Page ’ s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI . Fullstack AI Now imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation . Your first thought will probably be Which should I pick ChatGPT immediately comes to mind but you want to do your research properly . Through your research you find that Googles Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck at least among American AI models . Plus they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model . Perfect . Google seems like a good choice . Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity especially if they improve . But what about implementation Google offers enterpriseready APIs via Vertex with more features coming like auth database and payments Google Cloud for storage and now even at location TPUs that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible . Super . Suddenly your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google and along the way you never_touch an Nvidia product . But before you make your final decision you ask yourself Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term so I don ’ t get vendorlocked with an inferior offering I ’ ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never_want to bet against the man and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way . I don ’ t imagine Nvidia is particularly or really at all threatened by Google in the short term though Googles TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices reducing profit margin . Apparently OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it according to Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia . Though what is actually important is not_the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future . AlphaEvolve I allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve A Geminipowered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms The evolutionary AI system had in secret improved everything from the training of their AI models to Googles hardware i.e . their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multibillion dollar deal for them with Meta considering the same . The remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro not_even Gemini 2.5 . Today it ’ s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations and in the future it will use far more powerful models than that . Meaning that the better Google ’ s AI models get the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google ’ s models and hardware . The cheaper and better Google ’ s hardware the more powerful models can be built and run . The more powerful the models the better the hardware . And so on . Better AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia ’ s CUDA moat . One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA . But once AI models become sufficiently advanced the programming difficulty may not_be a concern or Google and Gemini create some CUDAvariant of their own . Rumors also exist of them doing just that . All in all This means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business it ’ s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia . If they do it often enough AI labs will eventually wonder can you build better AI models without Nvidia This will be especially true if other AIlabs do it too “ resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs ” Does this mean I think Nvidia is done for Not_at all as I said Ive spent enough time studying Jensen that Id never_want to bet against him . After all he is a man who roommated with a 17yearold excon covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5trilliondollar man . Jensen has a ton of cards to play and he ’ s already playing them perfectly . Nvidia still has a hardwarehardwaresoftware lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future . If they make a substantial compute leap Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia ’ s AI lab absorb one of the AI labs or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race . He is securing longterm deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia . Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development . He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem . Nvidia will likely begin to offer fullstack solutions of its own . And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia Google and AMD . Disclaimer I hold a significant long position in Google Alphabet . The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not_constitute financial or investment advice . Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions . TLDR Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin . But over the long term Google ’ s full stack offerings AI modelsapplications cloud and TPUs with AI model ’ s designed to improve AI models and hardware AlphaEvolve getting better Google might even take a long term lead . Though Jensen is playing Nvidia ’ s cards perfectly ."

      "title": "$2.4 Million Bet On RIVN - Cursed Carmaker Turnaround",
      "selftext": "Hey! First post on WSB. Here's why I'm betting big on Rivian: **Customers Love The Product** Talk to anyone you know who owns a Rivian, currently owns another EV and wants an upgrade, or posts on any of the EV/Rivian forums or subreddits. The product has well-documented reliability issues and despite that is still #1 in EV customer satisfaction. According to Consumer Reports' November 2025 survey, 86% of Rivian owners would buy again. BMW comes in second at 77%. Tesla is third at 75% with complaints about build quality. **CEO Has The Right Stuff** If you're seriously considering investing in Rivian, I urge you to watch an RJ Scaringe interview ([Here's one]( with John Collison, founder of Stripe). I've listened to hundreds of business and world leader interviews, and this guy comes across as one of the most authentic, ambitious, and competent CEOs out there. He got his PhD from MIT Sloan Automotive Lab and started Rivian in 2009. His passion for cars and specifically building the best possible electric vehicle from a product perspective really shows. Rivian is often compared to Lucid as car companies that IPO'd and fell off a cliff but are still hanging around. Lucid's leadership does not hold a candle to this guy. Go watch them yourself (Marc Winterhoff, Peter Rawlinson) and see the difference. **Solid Company Culture** I don't look at Glassdoor. Tech people tell you what they really feel about their companies on [Blind]( Before making an investment in a tech company, I always look at Blind reviews to get an overall feel for what it's like working there. For example, I don't want to see things like \"excellent work-life balance\" or \"nepotism\" because they suggest an unproductive environment. The overall vibe I get from Rivian is a fast-paced, scrappy startup that makes a lot of mistakes and pivots frequently. I like that. **The R2 Is A Game-Changer** At a much more accessible $45,000 base and slightly smaller than the R1S, production begins in early 2026 at their massive new VW-backed Georgia plant. This one makes or breaks the company, and initial reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. They're also planning a smaller, cheaper R3 crossover later in 2026. **Autonomy & AI Day On Dec 11** Rivian will likely unveil hands-free driving features, an overview of their sensor stack, and future autonomous roadmap. Not yet comparable to Tesla, but any unexpected good news here can boost the stock. **Amazon Delivery Vehicles** Rivian built about 2.5% of Amazon's fleet (30,000 vehicles) with a projection of over 10% by 2030 as gas vans are phased out. Rivian currently accounts for about 80-90% of Amazon's EV fleet. Take a look around you. If you see a cute-looking Amazon van, on the side you'll notice it's \"powered by Rivian\". **Platform Architecture Joint Venture With VW** With VW's financial backing, Rivian is developing a modular, vertically-integrated EV software stack. VW already plans to use it across its brands, giving Rivian a software licensing revenue stream. Any other manufacturer adopting the platform would be a major win. **Major Institutional Backing** Amazon owns 13% and VW owns 12.3% of Rivian. A welcome vote of confidence, given how closely they work together. Vanguard (6%), BlackRock (4%), UBS (1.6%) and a whole host of other well-known institutional investors are in as well. **The Chart Looks Awfully Like Major Accumulation** I'll admit it - I'm an astrologer. But you can't look at this chart and say something didn't change after the last earnings call. Popped from 12-18, consolidated at 14.5-15, and headed higher all within a month. Every intraday dip is getting bought back up with intensity. This stock has been beaten down for so long that many potential investors who love the company are waiting for it to drop to 12-13 again \"like it always does.\" It has steadily been making higher lows (6 separate times since Apr 2024 - roughly 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and just recently 14) and once it breaks out, all these dip buyers who are waiting for Godot are going to have to buy in much higher. **Some Personal Anecdotes** * An AI/ML PhD friend of mine currently working in the self-driving space claimed that Tesla FSD (Full Self-Driving) is a \"long-running failure\", bought Rivian stock because he \"likes the car and company\" and will buy a Rivian as his next vehicle. * My scammer ex-girlfriend had a Tesla but wanted me to buy a Rivian for her. I didn't, but every time we'd drive around town and she saw one she'd point at it and excitedly say \"Rivian!\" in that cute little Russian accent of hers. I don't miss her all that much, she was a complete pain in the ass. Really, I don't.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey First post on WSB . Heres why Im betting big on Rivian Customers Love The Product Talk to anyone you know who owns a Rivian currently owns another EV and wants an upgrade or posts on any of the EVRivian forums or subreddits . The product has welldocumented reliability issues and despite that is still 1 in EV customer satisfaction . According to Consumer Reports November 2025 survey 86 % of Rivian owners would buy again . BMW comes in second at 77 % . Tesla is third at 75 % with complaints about build quality . CEO Has The Right Stuff If youre seriously considering investing in Rivian I urge you to watch an RJ Scaringe interview Heres one with John Collison founder of Stripe . Ive listened to hundreds of business and world leader interviews and this guy comes across as one of the most authentic ambitious and competent CEOs out there . He got his PhD from MIT Sloan Automotive Lab and started Rivian in 2009 . His passion for cars and specifically building the best possible electric vehicle from a product perspective really shows . Rivian is often compared to Lucid as car companies that IPOd and fell off a cliff but are still hanging around . Lucids leadership does not_hold a candle to this guy . Go watch them yourself Marc Winterhoff Peter Rawlinson and see the difference . Solid Company Culture I dont look at Glassdoor . Tech people tell you what they really feel about their companies on Blind Before making an investment in a tech company I always look at Blind reviews to get an overall feel for what its like working there . For example I dont want to see things like excellent worklife balance or nepotism because they suggest an unproductive environment . The overall vibe I get from Rivian is a fastpaced scrappy startup that makes a lot of mistakes and pivots frequently . I like that . The R2 Is A GameChanger At a much more accessible $ 45000 base and slightly smaller than the R1S production begins in early 2026 at their massive new VWbacked Georgia plant . This one makes or breaks the company and initial reviews have been overwhelmingly positive . Theyre also planning a smaller cheaper R3 crossover later in 2026 . Autonomy AI Day On Dec 11 Rivian will likely unveil handsfree driving features an overview of their sensor stack and future autonomous roadmap . Not_yet comparable to Tesla but any unexpected good news here can boost the stock . Amazon Delivery Vehicles Rivian built about 2.5 % of Amazons fleet 30000 vehicles with a projection of over 10 % by 2030 as gas vans are phased out . Rivian currently accounts for about 8090 % of Amazons EV fleet . Take a look around you . If you see a cutelooking Amazon van on the side youll notice its powered by Rivian . Platform Architecture Joint Venture With VW With VWs financial backing Rivian is developing a modular verticallyintegrated EV software stack . VW already plans to use it across its brands giving Rivian a software licensing revenue stream . Any other manufacturer adopting the platform would be a major win . Major Institutional Backing Amazon owns 13 % and VW owns 12.3 % of Rivian . A welcome vote of confidence given how closely they work together . Vanguard 6 % BlackRock 4 % UBS 1.6 % and a whole host of other wellknown institutional investors are in as well . The Chart Looks Awfully Like Major Accumulation Ill admit it Im an astrologer . But you cant look at this chart and say something didnt change after the last earnings call . Popped from 1218 consolidated at 14.515 and headed higher all within a month . Every intraday dip is getting bought back up with intensity . This stock has been beaten down for so long that many potential investors who love the company are waiting for it to drop to 1213 again like it always does . It has steadily been making higher lows 6 separate times since Apr 2024 roughly 8 9 10 11 12 and just recently 14 and once it breaks out all these dip buyers who are waiting for Godot are going to have to buy in much higher . Some Personal Anecdotes An AIML PhD friend of mine currently working in the selfdriving space claimed that Tesla FSD Full SelfDriving is a longrunning failure bought Rivian stock because he likes the car and company and will buy a Rivian as his next vehicle . My scammer exgirlfriend had a Tesla but wanted me to buy a Rivian for her . I didnt but every time wed drive around town and she saw one shed point at it and excitedly say Rivian in that cute little Russian accent of hers . I dont miss her all that much she was a complete pain in the ass . Really I dont ."

      "selftext": "As we all know, 2025 has been a great year for equities yet again, with major indices significantly outpacing historic gains. Personally, as far as an AI bubble is concerned, the market still has legs to run -- and empirical as this is, I don't think we'll have a crash when everyone has a crash at the back of their mind. Here's my current portfolio weights, how I'll be reallocating for the new year, and my predictions on how each will move! I'll be deleting my trading apps once the new year starts due to other commitments and come back to this post at the end of next year :) NVDA - 17% Nvidia continues to be my largest holding. There is significant overlap with my ETFs, but it was and continues to be a long hold for me which I'm comfortable having overweight. Doubt we will see 30+% gains after such a huge run-up though, although a 20% gain wouldn't surprise me. QQQ - 16% I've unfortunately been holding QQQ from a time I didn't realise there were alternatives (QQQM) with much lower expense ratios. Anyway, doesn't make sense for me to sell and buy back, but just a note for beginners. Mag 7 propelled it to 20+% gains this year, I'm predicting a more conservative but evenly distributed 12% gain in 2026, supported by more mid caps. VOO - 15% Essentially the same thing as QQQ but with slightly less tech. Predicting a healthy 9% as tech continues to outpace other sectors. AAPL - 11% The Vision Pro hasn't seen much success yet, and I think it's very much a work in progress especially given the extremely high price point. However, with Apple regaining its spot as the top smartphone manufacturer and likely releasing a foldable phone next year, I think it'll continue to see revenue growth. Predicting a 16% upside. META - 9% Great to see that Metaverse expenditure is being cut, hope to see more of that in the coming year. While Meta AI is one of the worst AIs out there now, I don't think it'll be difficult for them to improve their model seeing how quickly Gemini has caught up with ChatGPT. As far as I'm concerned, the core advertising business continues to be a solid model and Instagram is still growing in terms of MAUs and average usage. Share price has been relatively shaky this year, but I think it will deliver more stable shareholder returns of 18%. VT - 7% Going to continue DCAing into VT, likely will be my top holding before the start of the new year. Non-US markets outperformed in the first half of 2025 but I don't have enough conviction to go into VXUS. Assuming global markets do better than the US, I'm projecting 11% upside. XLU - 6% My only defensive holding in utilities. Being capital-intensive, utilities should benefit greatly from a low-rate environment and having some exposure marginally reduces my drawdown risk. Looking to add on dips to increase holding as well. Don’t expect big gains, at most 8%, just on pace with the overall market. DUOL - 5% One of my only two high-risk plays. Down from highs over 540 this year, share price has begun to consolidate. The CEO mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that they are prioritising long-term user growth and teaching quality which was taken negatively by the market, but this is a good long-term outlook. With a 34% 3-5 year projected EPS growth rate, I expect the market to revalue the company more optimistically with a 32% gain. ANET - 3% Last but not least, my smallest holding (for now). My long-term AI data centre play that has a lot more upside than the big names have. Quite a volatile stock that has a high beta especially in tech downturns, but with the prospect of a continue, albeit slowing bull market, I believe renewed data centre investment will propel sales and earnings growth. My guess is 35%, and I will be adding ANET/VRT on dips close to their 50MA. Let me know what you guys think about my predictions!",

      "selftext_processed": "As we all know 2025 has been a great year for equities yet again with major indices significantly outpacing historic gains . Personally as far as an AI bubble is concerned the market still has legs to run and empirical as this is I dont think well have a crash when everyone has a crash at the back of their mind . Heres my current portfolio weights how Ill be reallocating for the new year and my predictions on how each will move Ill be deleting my trading apps once the new year starts due to other commitments and come back to this post at the end of next year NVDA 17 % Nvidia continues to be my largest holding . There is significant overlap with my ETFs but it was and continues to be a long hold for me which Im comfortable having overweight . Doubt we will see 30 % gains after such a huge runup though although a 20 % gain wouldnt surprise me . QQQ 16 % Ive unfortunately been holding QQQ from a time I didnt realise there were alternatives QQQM with much lower expense ratios . Anyway doesnt make sense for me to sell and buy back but just a note for beginners . Mag 7 propelled it to 20 % gains this year Im predicting a more conservative but evenly distributed 12 % gain in 2026 supported by more mid caps . VOO 15 % Essentially the same thing as QQQ but with slightly less tech . Predicting a healthy 9 % as tech continues to outpace other sectors . AAPL 11 % The Vision Pro hasnt seen much success yet and I think its very much a work in progress especially given the extremely high price point . However with Apple regaining its spot as the top smartphone manufacturer and likely releasing a foldable phone next year I think itll continue to see revenue growth . Predicting a 16 % upside . META 9 % Great to see that Metaverse expenditure is being cut hope to see more of that in the coming year . While Meta AI is one of the worst AIs out there now I dont think itll be difficult for them to improve their model seeing how quickly Gemini has caught up with ChatGPT . As far as Im concerned the core advertising business continues to be a solid model and Instagram is still growing in terms of MAUs and average usage . Share price has been relatively shaky this year but I think it will deliver more stable shareholder returns of 18 % . VT 7 % Going to continue DCAing into VT likely will be my top holding before the start of the new year . NonUS markets outperformed in the first half of 2025 but I dont have enough conviction to go into VXUS . Assuming global markets do better than the US Im projecting 11 % upside . XLU 6 % My only defensive holding in utilities . Being capitalintensive utilities should benefit greatly from a lowrate environment and having some exposure marginally reduces my drawdown risk . Looking to add on dips to increase holding as well . Don ’ t expect big gains at most 8 % just on pace with the overall market . DUOL 5 % One of my only two highrisk plays . Down from highs over 540 this year share price has begun to consolidate . The CEO mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that they are prioritising longterm user growth and teaching quality which was taken negatively by the market but this is a good longterm outlook . With a 34 % 35 year projected EPS growth rate I expect the market to revalue the company more optimistically with a 32 % gain . ANET 3 % Last but not_least my smallest holding for now . My longterm AI data centre play that has a lot more upside than the big names have . Quite a volatile stock that has a high beta especially in tech downturns but with the prospect of a continue albeit slowing bull market I believe renewed data centre investment will propel sales and earnings growth . My guess is 35 % and I will be adding ANETVRT on dips close to their 50MA . Let me know what you guys think about my predictions"

      "selftext": "Netflix has prevailed in its bid to buy much of Warner Bros. Discovery, agreeing to pay $72 billion for the Burbank-based Warner Bros. film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO. The two companies announced the blockbuster deal early Friday morning. The deal would give Netflix such beloved characters as Batman, Harry Potter and Fred Flintstone. “Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a statement. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies — from timeless classics like ‘Casablanca’ and ‘Citizen Kane’ to modern favorites like ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Friends’ — with our culture-defining titles like ‘Stranger Things,’ ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ and ‘Squid Game,’ we’ll be able to do that even better.” Netflix’s cash and stock transaction is valued at about $27.75 per Warner Bros. Discovery shares. Netflix also agreed to take on more than $10 billion in Warner Bros. debt, pushing the deal’s value to $82.7 billion. The breakthrough came late Thursday, soon after a deadline for deal sweeteners. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast had submitted bids earlier in the week as jockeying intensified for Hollywood’s biggest prize.",

I hadn't really put a finger on the possible value of the write-down, but I know it would be large. However, now we know. Warner Brothers Dscovery has taken a $9 billion write-down of its TV assets. On many levels this doesn't bode well for the company. WBD still has about $43 billion dollars in combined long-term and short-term debt on its balance sheet and still tens of billions of dollars in intangible assets. However, the good thing is that the company has been generating relatively decent free cash flow. So, again, that's a good thing. The companies wanting to buy this company would do well to really knuckle down on doing it's due diligence. At this point, I give the stock a rating of HOLD.",

      "selftext": "Basically: legendary Tom Lee is going all out and telling people Ethereum is about to have its 1971 moment. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, is also calling for the next evolution in market infrastructure, saying tokenization will transform finance. And everybody with a brain still firing neurons knows that tokenization will mainly happen on Ethereum. Traditional stock platforms take days to settle and won’t even allow you to swap one share for another — the current financial market is slow and non-lenient. Thankfully, decentralized and trustworthy Ethereum and their smart contracts are finally ready to change that, because digital is the future, and the financial markets are currently stuck in the centralized past, outside of the decentralized, democratized blockchain. Despite the biggest dogs calling for a financial revolution built on Ethereum, Ethereum has been flat for the last 5 years. This is your final chance to get your supercharged Ethereum golden ticket, BMNR, before the biggest evolution in market infrastructure reprices Ethereum forever.",

Larry Fink the CEO of BlackRock is also calling for the next evolution in market infrastructure saying tokenization will transform finance . And everybody with a brain still firing neurons knows that tokenization will mainly happen on Ethereum . Traditional stock platforms take days to settle and won ’ t even allow you to swap one share for another — the current financial market is slow and nonlenient . Thankfully decentralized and trustworthy Ethereum and their smart contracts are finally ready to change that because digital is the future and the financial markets are currently stuck in the centralized past outside of the decentralized democratized blockchain . Despite the biggest dogs calling for a financial revolution built on Ethereum Ethereum has been flat for the last 5 years . This is your final chance to get your supercharged Ethereum golden ticket BMNR before the biggest evolution in market infrastructure reprices Ethereum forever ."

      "selftext": "From doing past analysis, I realized that most people, including myself, miss out on life-changing huge gains because we sell our stocks too early. There are ton of stocks that within 1Y went up 100-200% and some over 5Y went up 1000%-3000%. One thing I noticed people like to do is day-trade or swing-trade and they feel good making a few thousand in one trade in just a few days. They think that they just made their monthly salary in a quick amount of time effortlessly. But then afterwards, the stock that they just sold ends up going up +30% in one day suddenly, then continues to go up consistently day by day, +5%, +7%, +3%... and so on, eventually before you know it, the stock has already went up +100%. Personally, I have changed my strategy and adopted more of a buy-and-hold approach. I view each share as precious and something that could be cheap now could be very valuable in the future. Hence, I try my absolute best not to sell any share unless I want to take profit and switch the money to either a defensive cash position to wait and buy dips/crashes, or switch the money to another stock that I feel has higher growth potential.",

There are ton of stocks that within 1Y went up 100200 % and some over 5Y went up 1000 % 3000 % . One thing I noticed people like to do is daytrade or swingtrade and they feel good making a few thousand in one trade in just a few days . They think that they just made their monthly salary in a quick amount of time effortlessly . But then afterwards the stock that they just sold ends up going up 30 % in one day suddenly then continues to go up consistently day by day 5 % 7 % 3 % ... and so on eventually before you know it the stock has already went up 100 % . Personally I have changed my strategy and adopted more of a buyandhold approach . I view each share as precious and something that could be cheap now could be very valuable in the future . Hence I try my absolute best not_to sell any share unless I want to take profit and switch the money to either a defensive cash position to wait and buy dipscrashes or switch the money to another stock that I feel has higher growth potential ."

In the following scenario, how much would my wash sale amount be? 1 March: I sell my entire position (100 shares) for a $100 realized loss; 1 April: I re-buy 100 shares of the stock (30 days’ past so no wash sale); 15 April: I sell 50 of the 100 shares of the stock for a $50 loss.

      "title": "TAL EDUCATION $TAL – A Bet on China Policy Shift",
      "selftext": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist. I've been openly bullish on Chinese equities, not blindly on the macro, but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years. My core China positions are BABA, BILI, WB, PDD, etc., and while digging through various research notes and podcasts, TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse. **Here's my thinking:** China's economy has been hit hard, much of it self-inflicted. The real estate crisis hit consumption, valuations eventually collapsed, Western capital stepped away, and the regulatory wave in 2020-2021 crushed entire industries overnight, private education/tutoring being one of the hardest hit. TAL, a leader in the space, went from a \\~$90 stock to a \\~$1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed. But today, the macro backdrop is subtly shifting. Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy, support job creation, and encourage entrepreneurship. Real estate cleanup efforts are underway, consumer data, while not amazing, is, and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift. None of this screams \"China is fixed,\" but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction. **The Key Catalyst: Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions** One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinese-focused podcasts and panels is this: Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education. Remember: the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out China's private tutoring industry, which had been massive. TAL went from a \\~$90 stock to $1. That was the market pricing in near-death. Logic behind potential easing makes sense: * ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer * ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category * It acted as a foundational support for talent creation. Which is now a h * Households spend \\~17% of income on education (\\~5x the global average) * Investment + hiring + innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured, regulated private education aligns with national goals, especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs. Beijing seeks to nurture local talent, enhance educational outcomes, and boost household spending. Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense, as it can stimulate the economy, revive consumption, and promote upward mobility. This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules, making it a rational strategy. The Kicker: If the tutoring industry reopens, even partially, TAL and New Oriental (EDU) would effectively operate as a duopoly. Heavy compliance requirements + political scrutiny = massive barriers to new entrants. For Beijing, this is actually preferable, and for investors, even more so. **Why TAL Specifically?** This is no longer the old hyper-growth, hyper-aggressive, burn-capital tutoring giant. TAL today is: * Leaner * ﻿﻿More tech-driven * Operating within defined regulatory lanes * ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves * ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward ed-tech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly, TAL's operational muscle memory, national presence, brand trust, and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage. Think of it as a coiled spring. Regulatory easing doesn't need to revive 2019 TAL. It just needs to allow profitable, compliant business lines to scale. The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $8 and $11 for months. It's been essentially flat, under-owned, and overlooked. For me, this is what an asymmetric setup looks like: limited structural downside, but substantial upside if policy shifts in TAL's favor. A re-rating doesn't require TAL to return to its old model-it simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries. **MY POSITION:** 200 Contracts of the $10 Strike, Jan 15 2027 Calls Paid an Average of $3.5 in premiums for a total of $71,712 **TL;DR** * ﻿﻿China may be easing or clarifying the 2021 tutoring crackdown-big potential catalyst. * Education is huge in China: households spend \\~17% of income on it (\\~5x global avg). * Reopening the sector helps job creation, consumption, and talent development. * ﻿﻿If rules loosen, TAL + EDU become a near-duopoly due to heavy compliance barriers * ﻿﻿Stock has been range-bound ($8-$11) but sentiment + policy tone in China is improving. * I'm in Jan 2027 $10 calls (200 contracts, \\~$72K) as a long-term bet.",

      "selftext_processed": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist . Ive been openly bullish on Chinese equities not_blindly on the macro but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years . My core China positions are BABA BILI WB PDD etc . and while digging through various research notes and podcasts TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse . Heres my thinking Chinas economy has been hit hard much of it selfinflicted . The real estate crisis hit consumption valuations eventually collapsed Western capital stepped away and the regulatory wave in 20202021 crushed entire industries overnight private educationtutoring being one of the hardest hit . TAL a leader in the space went from a $ 90 stock to a $ 1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed . But today the macro backdrop is subtly shifting . Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy support job creation and encourage entrepreneurship . Real estate cleanup efforts are underway consumer data while not_amazing is and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift . None of this screams China is fixed but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction . The Key Catalyst Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinesefocused podcasts and panels is this Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education . Remember the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out Chinas private tutoring industry which had been massive . TAL went from a $ 90 stock to $ 1 . That was the market pricing in neardeath . Logic behind potential easing makes sense ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category It acted as a foundational support for talent creation . Which is now a h Households spend 17 % of income on education 5x the global average Investment hiring innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured regulated private education aligns with national goals especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs . Beijing seeks to nurture local talent enhance educational outcomes and boost household spending . Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense as it can stimulate the economy revive consumption and promote upward mobility . This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules making it a rational strategy . The Kicker If the tutoring industry reopens even partially TAL and New Oriental EDU would effectively operate as a duopoly . Heavy compliance requirements political scrutiny massive barriers to new entrants . For Beijing this is actually preferable and for investors even more so . Why TAL Specifically This is no_longer the old hypergrowth hyperaggressive burncapital tutoring giant . TAL today is Leaner ﻿﻿More techdriven Operating within defined regulatory lanes ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward edtech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly TALs operational muscle memory national presence brand trust and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage . Think of it as a coiled spring . Regulatory easing doesnt need to revive 2019 TAL . It just needs to allow profitable compliant business lines to scale . The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $ 8 and $ 11 for months . Its been essentially flat underowned and overlooked . For me this is what an asymmetric setup looks like limited structural downside but substantial upside if policy shifts in TALs favor . A rerating doesnt require TAL to return to its old modelit simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries . MY POSITION 200 Contracts of the $ 10 Strike Jan 15 2027 Calls Paid an Average of $ 3.5 in premiums for a total of $ 71712 TLDR ﻿﻿China may be easing or clarifying the 2021 tutoring crackdownbig potential catalyst . Education is huge in China households spend 17 % of income on it 5x global avg . Reopening the sector helps job creation consumption and talent development . ﻿﻿If rules loosen TAL EDU become a nearduopoly due to heavy compliance barriers ﻿﻿Stock has been rangebound $ 8 $ 11 but sentiment policy tone in China is improving . Im in Jan 2027 $ 10 calls 200 contracts $ 72K as a longterm bet ."

      "selftext": "MoonLake ($MLTX) is soaring today, and I believe we are just getting started. This is the beginning of a move from additional data that can drop any day now, and a run-up to an FDA meeting on Dec 15th. Thesis (TL;DR): MoonLake fell off a cliff after its big HS Phase 3 readout—down nearly 90%—because the market hyper-focused on a single narrowly missed endpoint, not the whole data set. Under the surface, sonelokimab (SLK) hit consistent, significant efficacy and is being evaluated for multiple diseases, with two pivotal catalysts coming within weeks. This is one of those rare moments where “disaster” headlines might be the exact signal for opportunity. Data & Why the Panic Is Overdone: • VELA-1: Big win. Mid-30s HiSCR response vs teens placebo, all core secondaries positive. • VELA-2: Drug effect consistent with VELA-1, but placebo rate jumped—primary missed by a thread (p ≈ .05). All secondary endpoints still positive; combined analysis is strongly significant (p < 0.001). [SLK HS VELA Trial Data]( ￼​• Takeaway: High placebo noise like this is standard in HS trials. Look at the totality: consistent drug effect, positive secondaries, and durable benefit, not “dead drug.” More Than HS: Platform Upside (4 Indications):SLK is not a one-trick pony. MoonLake is moving fast across multiple indications, including: • Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS): Adult and adolescent, with long-term extension data. • Palmoplantar Pustulosis (PPP): LEDA Phase 2, Company expects to move froward to a Phase 3 Q3 2026. • Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA): S-OLARIS readout Q1 2026. • Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): IZAR Phase 3, 2026. Upcoming Catalysts (Why Act Now): • Dec 15, 2025: FDA Type B meeting to discuss whether the current HS data package is sufficient to support a Biologics License Application. A “yes” could drive a meaningful stock rerating higher, while a “not without additional data” outcome appears largely already reflected in the prior 90% one‑day decline but would buy additional time setting MLTX up for potential rerating as we get additional data readouts on the various trials and indications within the next year. ￼​• Q1–Q2 2026: S-OLARIS (axSpA), VELA-TEEN/long-term HS, IZAR (PsA). You might only have a week or two to get a thesis-confirming or thesis-breaking regulatory answer—at panic-level valuations. Balance Sheet: MoonLake isn’t hurting for cash. They have hundreds of millions on hand, a fresh $75M raise, with extended runway into 2027. You’re not waiting for a raise headline after every catalyst; you’re waiting for data, and more data is coming imminently. Lawsuit/FUD Section (for the Record):Yes, the numerous class actions headlines exist: they claim management pumped SLK effectiveness beyond what the data readouts allegedly showed, if you only focus one a single narrowly missed data point ultimately caused by higher placebo response. In biotech, legal and headline risk is always present post-drop, but those lawsuits don’t change the underlying drug effect or what the FDA—and larger future pharma buyers—will review soon. The lawsuits are noise; the SLK’s efficacy and a path forward to an FDA approval is the signal. Risks: • FDA could require more data or reject the BLA proposal—delays and more cash burn. • Pipeline indications could go nowhere and this is still a one-asset, high-volatility biotech—but I like the data so far. Asymmetric Setup: Almost all the bad is priced in after the crash—what’s not priced in is a credible FDA greenlight, and the multi-indication platform angle. The next immediate catalyst, FDA, will likely decide if this rerates violently higher, in the very near term. This window, with catalyst stacked throughout 2026. And the whole Street trading off panic and lawsuits, could close fast. Part of the reason I'm so bullish here is MLTX is a small overlooked stock, which has pretty much been left for dead here after the Phase 3 VELA Primary Endpoint headline \"miss\". The data is there - SLK works, the market has priced MLTX like SLK doesn't work. But the data says it does, and there are additional trials to show that SLK works across not just HS, but also PPP, PsA, axSpA but the market is still pricing MLTX like SLK doesn't work. I believe that means the market needs to reprice higher, and rapidly with the barrage of catalysts ahead on this one. ￼​Disclosure: I (obviously) own MLTX stock and MLTX stock options, my kids even own MLTX. I like the stock. I don't know your personal financial situation, this is not financial advice. Do your own research [I have other holdings than this but just to satisfy requirements—I'm posting this one.](",

      "selftext_processed": "MoonLake $ MLTX is soaring today and I believe we are just getting started . This is the beginning of a move from additional data that can drop any day now and a runup to an FDA meeting on Dec 15th . Thesis TLDR MoonLake fell off a cliff after its big HS Phase 3 readout—down nearly 90 % —because the market hyperfocused on a single narrowly missed endpoint not_the whole data set . Under the surface sonelokimab SLK hit consistent significant efficacy and is being evaluated for multiple diseases with two pivotal catalysts coming within weeks . This is one of those rare moments where “ disaster ” headlines might be the exact signal for opportunity . Data Why the Panic Is Overdone • VELA1 Big win . Mid30s HiSCR response vs teens placebo all core secondaries positive . • VELA2 Drug effect consistent with VELA1 but placebo rate jumped—primary missed by a thread p ≈ .05 . All secondary endpoints still positive combined analysis is strongly significant p 0.001 . SLK HS VELA Trial Data ￼​• Takeaway High placebo noise like this is standard in HS trials . Look at the totality consistent drug effect positive secondaries and durable benefit not_ “ dead drug. ” More Than HS Platform Upside 4 IndicationsSLK is not_a onetrick pony . MoonLake is moving fast across multiple indications including • Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Adult and adolescent with longterm extension data . • Palmoplantar Pustulosis PPP LEDA Phase 2 Company expects to move froward to a Phase 3 Q3 2026 . • Axial Spondyloarthritis axSpA SOLARIS readout Q1 2026 . • Psoriatic Arthritis PsA IZAR Phase 3 2026 . Upcoming Catalysts Why Act Now • Dec 15 2025 FDA Type B meeting to discuss whether the current HS data package is sufficient to support a Biologics License Application . A “ yes ” could drive a meaningful stock rerating higher while a “ not without additional data ” outcome appears largely already reflected in the prior 90 % one‑day decline but would buy additional time setting MLTX up for potential rerating as we get additional data readouts on the various trials and indications within the next year . ￼​• Q1–Q2 2026 SOLARIS axSpA VELATEENlongterm HS IZAR PsA . You might only have a week or two to get a thesisconfirming or thesisbreaking regulatory answer—at paniclevel valuations . Balance Sheet MoonLake isn ’ t hurting for cash . They have hundreds of millions on hand a fresh $ 75M raise with extended runway into 2027 . You ’ re not_waiting for a raise headline after every catalyst you ’ re waiting for data and more data is coming imminently . LawsuitFUD Section for the RecordYes the numerous class actions headlines exist they claim management pumped SLK effectiveness beyond what the data readouts allegedly showed if you only focus one a single narrowly missed data point ultimately caused by higher placebo response . In biotech legal and headline risk is always present postdrop but those lawsuits don ’ t change the underlying drug effect or what the FDA—and larger future pharma buyers—will review soon . The lawsuits are noise the SLK ’ s efficacy and a path forward to an FDA approval is the signal . Risks • FDA could require more data or reject the BLA proposal—delays and more cash burn . • Pipeline indications could go nowhere_and this is still a oneasset highvolatility biotech—but I like the data so far . Asymmetric Setup Almost all the bad is priced in after the crash—what ’ s not_priced in is a credible FDA greenlight and the multiindication platform angle . The next immediate catalyst FDA will likely decide if this rerates violently higher in the very near term . This window with catalyst stacked throughout 2026 . And the whole Street trading off panic and lawsuits could close fast . Part of the reason Im so bullish here is MLTX is a small overlooked stock which has pretty much been left for dead here after the Phase 3 VELA Primary Endpoint headline miss . The data is there SLK works the market has priced MLTX like SLK doesnt work . But the data says it does and there are additional trials to show that SLK works across not_just HS but also PPP PsA axSpA but the market is still pricing MLTX like SLK doesnt work . I believe that means the market needs to reprice higher and rapidly with the barrage of catalysts ahead on this one . ￼​Disclosure I obviously own MLTX stock and MLTX stock options my kids even own MLTX . I like the stock . I dont know your personal financial situation this is not_financial advice . Do your own research I have other holdings than this but just to satisfy requirements—Im posting this one ."

      "title": "[DD] WIX: The Market Says \"Dead Legacy Tech.\" The Math Says \"Rule of 40\" Cash Cow (9x EV/FCF).",
      "selftext": "I've been screening for value in SaaS lately because everything feels expensive, and I kept ignoring **Wix (WIX)**. Like most of you, I still thought of them as that annoying legacy website builder from 2015 that loses money and gets crushed by Shopify. But I finally dug into their 10-Ks and updated guidance for 2025, and honestly, the numbers tell a completely different story than the sentiment. It looks like a classic capital return play that's being priced like a distressed asset. I wanted to throw my thesis out here to see if I'm missing something obvious. Here is the raw math I’m looking at: 1. They actually stopped burning cash This was my biggest surprise. I thought they were unprofitable. Turns out management did a hard pivot on efficiency over the last 18 months and it's showing up in the GAAP numbers. Check out the Free Cash Flow (FCF) margin ramp: * **2022:** 2% (Barely broke even at $32M) * **2023:** 16% ($246M) * **2024:** 28% ($488M) * **2025 (Est):** 30%+ (On track for \\~$600M) Basically, they hit the \"Rule of 40\" way faster than anyone expected, but the stock price hasn't really moved to reflect that they are now a cash cow. 2. The Multiple is weirdly low If you look at other SaaS companies growing revenue in the double digits with 30% margins, they usually trade at a premium. WIX is in the basement. * **WIX is trading at \\~9.0x EV/FCF.** * **The median for their peer group is around 14.2x.** * **The \"Quality\" names trade at 15-25x.** Even if you don't think WIX is a \"premium\" asset, a 40% discount to the *median* seems excessive for a company printing $600M a year in cash. 3. The \"AI Risk\" might be backwards The bear case is always \"AI will make website builders obsolete.\" I looked into this, and it seems like AI is actually acting as a funnel for them right now. Two things stood out in the segments: 1. **Partners (Agencies):** This isn't DIY revenue. This is B2B revenue from agencies building sites for clients. It grew at a **30% CAGR** and hit **$610M** in 2024. This revenue is way stickier than the churn-heavy DIY stuff. 2. **Base44:** They bought/launched this AI app builder recently. It went from **300k users in June '25 to 2 Million in October**. I haven't modeled much revenue from this yet to be safe, but it gives them a foot in the door of the $25B low-code market. Valuation / Summary I ran a DCF assuming they just hold the line on margins (low 30s) and keep growing revenue at a boring 15%. My model spits out an intrinsic value of around **$170**. Even if I'm wrong on the growth and just apply a standard 14x multiple to their current cash flow, the stock should be significantly higher than $96. **Where could I be wrong? (Bear Case)** I'm trying to kill this trade before I size up. * Obviously, Shopify is the elephant in the room. WIX seems to be winning on \"services\" websites vs. pure e-commerce, but the overlap is scary. * Are SMBs about to get crushed in 2026? If the macro turns, their churn could look ugly fast. Has anyone else looked at their Partner numbers recently? Am I overestimating the stickiness there? **Disclosure:** Long WIX. **Reference:** I put all my charts and other details into a PDF if you want to check my math on my blog: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been screening for value in SaaS lately because everything feels expensive and I kept ignoring Wix WIX . Like most of you I still thought of them as that annoying legacy website builder from 2015 that loses money and gets crushed by Shopify . But I finally dug into their 10Ks and updated guidance for 2025 and honestly the numbers tell a completely different story than the sentiment . It looks like a classic capital return play thats being priced like a distressed asset . I wanted to throw my thesis out here to see if Im missing something obvious . Here is the raw math I ’ m looking at 1 . They actually stopped burning cash This was my biggest surprise . I thought they were unprofitable . Turns out management did a hard pivot on efficiency over the last 18 months and its showing up in the GAAP numbers . Check out the Free Cash Flow FCF margin ramp 2022 2 % Barely broke even at $ 32M 2023 16 % $ 246M 2024 28 % $ 488M 2025 Est 30 % On track for $ 600M Basically they hit the Rule of 40 way faster than anyone expected but the stock price hasnt really moved to reflect that they are now a cash cow . 2 . The Multiple is weirdly low If you look at other SaaS companies growing revenue in the double digits with 30 % margins they usually trade at a premium . WIX is in the basement . WIX is trading at 9.0x EVFCF . The median for their peer group is around 14.2x . The Quality names trade at 1525x . Even if you dont think WIX is a premium asset a 40 % discount to the median seems excessive for a company printing $ 600M a year in cash . 3 . The AI Risk might be backwards The bear case is always AI will make website builders obsolete . I looked into this and it seems like AI is actually acting as a funnel for them right now . Two things stood out in the segments 1 . Partners Agencies This isnt DIY revenue . This is B2B revenue from agencies building sites for clients . It grew at a 30 % CAGR and hit $ 610M in 2024 . This revenue is way stickier than the churnheavy DIY stuff . 2 . Base44 They boughtlaunched this AI app builder recently . It went from 300k users in June 25 to 2 Million in October . I havent modeled much revenue from this yet to be safe but it gives them a foot in the door of the $ 25B lowcode market . Valuation Summary I ran a DCF assuming they just hold the line on margins low 30s and keep growing revenue at a boring 15 % . My model spits out an intrinsic value of around $ 170 . Even if Im wrong on the growth and just apply a standard 14x multiple to their current cash flow the stock should be significantly higher than $ 96 . Where could I be wrong Bear Case Im trying to kill this trade before I size up . Obviously Shopify is the elephant in the room . WIX seems to be winning on services websites vs. pure ecommerce but the overlap is scary . Are SMBs about to get crushed in 2026 If the macro turns their churn could look ugly fast . Has anyone else looked at their Partner numbers recently Am I overestimating the stickiness there Disclosure Long WIX . Reference I put all my charts and other details into a PDF if you want to check my math on my blog"

      "selftext": "Been investing for a while now. Stocks, real estate, some Solana through Asgard, the usual mix. My rule: 70% return, I take half off minimum. Sometimes all of it. Why? Because I've watched too many people ride winners back to zero waiting for \"just a bit more.\" The greed is real and it kills portfolios. That said - I break this rule for stuff I'm actually long on. Real estate that's throwing off cash? Not selling. Solana I'm staking? Staying put. Quality dividend plays? Those compound forever. But random defi yields, momentum stocks, anything that smells like hype? 70% and gone. No second thoughts. Basically: exit the bets, hold the investments. Time frame - 12 to 15 yrs you all have a number like this???",

Real estate thats throwing off cash Not_selling . Solana Im staking Staying put . Quality dividend plays Those compound forever .

Dealer Backlash/Cancellations: A group of UK car dealers are publicly protesting $AUTO's high listing prices and are threatening package downgrades/cancellations. 2. Macro Headwinds: Concerns over constrained used car supply (cars selling too fast means dealers buy fewer premium ads) and an FCA investigation into motor finance created industry uncertainty. TL;DR? The market is panicking over dealer squabbles and temporary car supply issues. Today's Price vs. Last Time The current price point is sitting near where it was a couple of years ago. The key difference? The company is fundamentally stronger now. We are buying 2026 earnings at a 2023 valuation. The Buy Thesis: Why You'll Get Rich • The Moat (90%+ Market Share): $AUTO is the UK's undisputed car-buying destination. Dealers must be on the platform. This is a perpetual license to raise prices and print cash. • Insane Margins: A 63% Operating Margin is unheard of for a business like this. It's a tech company masquerading as a car platform. • Share Buybacks: The company is actively executing a huge buyback, confirming that management believes their own stock is dirt cheap. This artificially boosts EPS and rewards shareholders. stop looking at the noise. Look at the balance sheet. This is a high-quality, high-profit monopoly trading at a fear discount. Load up.",

TLDR The market is panicking over dealer squabbles and temporary car supply issues . Todays Price vs. Last Time The current price point is sitting near where it was a couple of years ago . The key difference The company is fundamentally stronger now . We are buying 2026 earnings at a 2023 valuation . The Buy Thesis Why Youll Get Rich • The Moat 90 % Market Share $ AUTO is the UKs undisputed carbuying destination . Dealers must be on the platform . This is a perpetual license to raise prices and print cash . • Insane Margins A 63 % Operating Margin is unheard of for a business like this . Its a tech company masquerading as a car platform . • Share Buybacks The company is actively executing a huge buyback confirming that management believes their own stock is dirt cheap .

The company even changed its name to Meta from Facebook in 2021 to signal its priorities. >The proposed metaverse cuts are part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound ⁠in Hawaii last month, Bloomberg reported. >Cuts ‌that high would most likely include layoffs as early as January, according to the report. Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters ‍request for comment. >\"Smart move, just late,\" said Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber. \"This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought ​years ago.\" >The metaverse group sits within Reality Labs, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality ‌headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. >Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community. >However, it has achieved an early lead with its smart glasses, as competitors such as Alphabet's Google, [Apple]( and Snap failed to ⁠capitalize on the market potential with their initial attempts. >The ​report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant ​in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. >To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 ‍billion in capital spending ⁠this year. Overall, large tech companies are expected to spend around $400 billion on AI this year. >The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, ⁠with Zuckerberg personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp ‌with million-dollar pay packages.",

The Facebook parents shares rose 4 % as the move eased ‌some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars only for the ‌business to burn more than $ 60 billion since 2020 . The company even changed its name to Meta from Facebook in 2021 to signal its priorities . The proposed metaverse cuts are part of the companys annual budget planning for 2026 which included a series of meetings at Zuckerbergs compound ⁠in Hawaii last month Bloomberg reported . Cuts ‌that high would most likely include layoffs as early as January according to the report . Meta did not_immediately respond to a Reuters ‍request for comment . Smart move just late said Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber . This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not_as prosperous as management thought ​years ago . The metaverse group sits within Reality Labs which produces the companys Quest mixedreality ‌headsets smart glasses made with EssilorLuxotticas RayBan and upcoming augmentedreality glasses . Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community . However it has achieved an early lead with its smart glasses as competitors such as Alphabets Google Apple and Snap failed to ⁠capitalize on the market potential with their initial attempts . The ​report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant ​in Silicon Valleys artificialintelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception . To fuel its ambitious goals Meta has committed as much as $ 72 ‍billion in capital spending ⁠this year . Overall large tech companies are expected to spend around $ 400 billion on AI this year . The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year ⁠with Zuckerberg personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp ‌with milliondollar pay packages ."

      "selftext": "Alcoa's (AA) stock price has recently shown a strong rally, climbing over 18% in the 90 days leading up to early November 2025. This positive momentum includes a jump of over 6% on December 3, 2025, reaching $44.09. This upward trend follows strong third-quarter 2025 earnings and new strategic contracts. Notably, the company has secured a 10-year renewable energy contract for its Massena smelter in New York. Their recent success is a growing demand for aluminum driven by emerging technologies, particularly data centers and batteries. The AI build-out is a major new demand driver for aluminum. Data centers require massive amounts of aluminum for components like server racks, cooling units, and radiators, as demand for the metal soars. In the battery sector, the global aluminum-based battery market is projected to grow significantly, driven by increasing demand for energy storage and the expansion of the EV market, as the market is forecast to grow from $5 billion to over $12 billion by 2032. ...and one of the best things I've heard from the Investor's Conference yesterday was Alcoa is considering selling some of its non-used sites to AI companies and data center operators to capitalize on the massive power infrastructure they already have in place at these locations. .Has anyone here ALSO been interested in this potential turn-around story for them?",

      "selftext": "Hi all just wanted a non biased opinion on this . Currently have 17 houses and after all expenses and repairs etc they are making around $220 profit per month . I've been doing this for the last 9 years now and considering it's costing an average of $30k to purchase the house with deposits etc etc this is a return of roughly 8% give or take . Let's say prices rise 2-3% per year it's a 10-11% return . For the simplicity of it all is this why people just get an average of 10% in the stock market each year ? It seems like a crazy amount of work on my property end to make what people are in the S&P500 . I know the stock market goes up and down and end up averaging out but if I'm looking at the next 20years . What's everyone's thoughts on steering more toward the stocks market purely because it doubles every 9years or so on average I know . House prices I don't see doubling every 9-10year . Am I missing something here ? I'll add in that I've had a very successful run with property just wondering if it's time to park the $ in stocks rather than more roofs",

Ive been doing this for the last 9 years now and considering its costing an average of $ 30k to purchase the house with deposits etc etc this is a return of roughly 8 % give or take . Lets say prices rise 23 % per year its a 1011 % return . For the simplicity of it all is this why people just get an average of 10 % in the stock market each year It seems like a crazy amount of work on my property end to make what people are in the SP500 . I know the stock market goes up and down and end up averaging out but if Im looking at the next 20years . Whats everyones thoughts on steering more toward the stocks market purely because it doubles every 9years or so on average I know . House prices I dont see doubling every 910year . Am I missing something here Ill add in that Ive had a very successful run with property just wondering if its time to park the $ in stocks rather than more roofs"

      "title": "if Tesla is just auto + energy till 2030, is mid-440s cheap or a joke?",
      "selftext": "I’ve always felt Tesla is one of the strangest stocks I follow. Every few weeks the headlines turn super bearish or sentiment feels awful, and somehow the price just refuses to die. Since October it’s actually held up better than I expected: it was around $456 back then, dropped into the high $380s in November, bounced back to ~430, and now it’s sitting in the mid-440s. After all that noise, it’s basically only a small step down from October. What’s weird to me is that the news in the same period hasn’t sounded great. I remember a bunch of pieces about “margins getting crushed” and “Tesla losing its EV lead” as cheaper EVs (especially from China) grabbed share. In places like France and Sweden, sales were down something like 40–50% YoY, and I just saw another article saying that in the UK, November sales were down about 19%, yet TSLA still roughly up 4%. After Q3, the stock did sell off for a bit, which kind of matched the mood: GAAP operating income down ~40% YoY, operating margin ~5.8%, total gross margin ~18%, auto gross margin ex-credits only mid-teens vs close to 30% at the peak. Revenue hit a record, but net income was still down ~35–40% YoY. The one real bright spot was they printed almost $4B in free cash flow and have over $40B in cash, so the balance sheet doesn’t really scare me. Personally I still see Tesla as a genuinely “very good” auto + energy business, I just can’t really call it cheap here with a big margin of safety. For me to get more comfortable, I’d want either a clear trend of margin recovery, or the AI / FSD / robotics story actually showing up as a visible line on the P&L instead of just keynotes and hype. So I’m honestly curious: if Tesla mostly stays a really good auto + energy company for the rest of this decade and robotaxis / robots aren’t huge before 2030, what kind of PE would you put on that? Under that assumption, is today’s price cheap, fair, or just straight-up expensive to you? And if I butchered any of these stats, feel free to correct me in the comments. aslo anyone wants to dig into the UK stuff, this was the dashboard I was looking at: [Tesla UK sales down ~19% in November, New Automotive data shows.](",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve always felt Tesla is one of the strangest stocks I follow . Every few weeks the headlines turn super bearish or sentiment feels awful and somehow the price just refuses to die . Since October it ’ s actually held up better than I expected it was around $ 456 back then dropped into the high $ 380s in November bounced back to 430 and now it ’ s sitting in the mid440s . After all that noise it ’ s basically only a small step down from October . What ’ s weird to me is that the news in the same period hasn ’ t sounded great . I remember a bunch of pieces about “ margins getting crushed ” and “ Tesla losing its EV lead ” as cheaper EVs especially from China grabbed share . In places like France and Sweden sales were down something like 40–50 % YoY and I just saw another article saying that in the UK November sales were down about 19 % yet TSLA still roughly up 4 % . After Q3 the stock did sell off for a bit which kind of matched the mood GAAP operating income down 40 % YoY operating margin 5.8 % total gross margin 18 % auto gross margin excredits only midteens vs close to 30 % at the peak . Revenue hit a record but net income was still down 35–40 % YoY . The one real bright spot was they printed almost $ 4B in free cash flow and have over $ 40B in cash so the balance sheet doesn ’ t really scare me . Personally I still see Tesla as a genuinely “ very good ” auto energy business I just can ’ t really call it cheap here with a big margin of safety . For me to get more comfortable I ’ d want either a clear trend of margin recovery or the AI FSD robotics story actually showing up as a visible line on the PL instead of just keynotes and hype . So I ’ m honestly curious if Tesla mostly stays a really good auto energy company for the rest of this decade and robotaxis robots aren ’ t huge before 2030 what kind of PE would you put on that Under that assumption is today ’ s price cheap fair or just straightup expensive to you And if I butchered any of these stats feel free to correct me in the comments . aslo anyone wants to dig into the UK stuff this was the dashboard I was looking at Tesla UK sales down 19 % in November New Automotive data shows ."

In the best case, I would make around an 11% profit if I sold during the buyback. However, I currently receive about a 10% dividend per year after taxes (based on the tax rules in my country). At the moment, I would not sell. I have held the stock for 12 months already, which means I have already gotten back 10% of my purchase price through dividends. I also believe that asset-backed lending, specialty financing, and hybrid capital are financial instruments that will be used even more in the future. What is your opinion on BCP?",

      "selftext": "Japan’s 10-year JGB yield touched 1.917% on Thursday the highest level since 2007. It’s basically the market’s way of signaling that investors aren’t fully convinced about the Bank of Japan’s current policy path. The BOJ is stuck between two bad options: Raise rates further: yields likely push even higher, tightening conditions at a time when parts of the economy are still fragile. Cut or stay on hold: risks re-accelerating inflation after spending most of the decade trying to get it under control.It’s one of those situations where any direction introduces new problems. The next BOJ meeting should be interesting because the window for “gentle normalization” looks like it’s narrowing fast. Source:",

The BOJ is stuck between two bad options Raise rates further yields likely push even higher tightening conditions at a time when parts of the economy are still fragile . Cut or stay on hold risks reaccelerating inflation after spending most of the decade trying to get it under control.It ’ s one of those situations where any direction introduces new problems . The next BOJ meeting should be interesting because the window for “ gentle normalization ” looks like it ’ s narrowing fast . Source"

Intrinsic value of time and trials is not priced in. edit: this sub being against it for vibes instead of science and money is all the proof i need that the stock is down and undervalued due to regards. Reverse reddit. Calls. As we all know Moderna came into being as a cancer immunotherapy company then used their tech to create the covid vax and made a ton of money on it so their stock skyrocketed and now its where it started. Since then the trials for their immunotherapy cleared phase 1, 2, and is now a year into phase 3 and its massively successful in clearing cancer in half the patients. So we have a product that can generate billions working out and is basically just a couple approvals away from the market. The stock has been shorted to the earth and is stable in the mid 20s while not going further down. So this suggests this is the bottom so already a safe entry point. Low risk of losing any significant amounts. The price factors in lawsuits that will be settled this spring while not factoring in any upside to literal cancer therapies. before anyone comes at me saying its just melanoma; the pipeline works for any cancer and they can use that data to apply for expedited approvals for the rest of the cancer suit. lower side seems to be non-existent while the up side seems to be 10x. What am i missing here? Postion: 30k shares at 27.5 Average.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Moderna bottomed out where it was when it started in 2019 on their cancer immunotherapy . Intrinsic value of time and trials is not_priced in . edit this sub being against it for vibes instead of science and money is all the proof i need that the stock is down and undervalued due to regards . Reverse reddit . Calls . As we all know Moderna came into being as a cancer immunotherapy company then used their tech to create the covid vax and made a ton of money on it so their stock skyrocketed and now its where it started . Since then the trials for their immunotherapy cleared phase 1 2 and is now a year into phase 3 and its massively successful in clearing cancer in half the patients . So we have a product that can generate billions working out and is basically just a couple approvals away from the market . The stock has been shorted to the earth and is stable in the mid 20s while not_going further down . So this suggests this is the bottom so already a safe entry point . Low risk of losing any significant amounts . The price factors in lawsuits that will be settled this spring while not_factoring in any upside to literal cancer therapies . before anyone comes at me saying its just melanoma the pipeline works for any cancer and they can use that data to apply for expedited approvals for the rest of the cancer suit . lower side seems to be nonexistent while the up side seems to be 10x . What am i missing here Postion 30k shares at 27.5 Average ."

      "selftext": "Amid the ongoing AI investment boom, market concerns had previously surfaced that Oracle (ORCL.US) might issue up to $100 billion in debt to fund its AI ambitions. Worries over Oracle's debt situation drove its five year credit default swap (CDS) to surge to a three year high. However, BNP Paribas believes Oracle's actual debt issuance will be significantly less than $100 billion. Therefore, Oracle may only need to issue $25 billion to $35 billion in debt to fund its AI infrastructure development. While this additional debt issuance would come on top of the company's recent $18 billion bond offering, it remains far below the $100 billion level that had investors concerned. It's worth noting that given Oracle's high profit margins in its cloud infrastructure business, we also have reason to believe the company can withstand a higher debt burden. Management could also explore alternative financing solutions (such as vendor financing) to alleviate upfront cash outlay pressures. Many institutions have already assigned Oracle an “Overweight” rating, but due to increased capital expenditures and currency fluctuations, some have lowered their target price from $430 to $390. Furthermore, the market currently prices Oracle's collaboration with OpenAI at only a “minimal upside.” This can be calculated: approximately 84% of Oracle's current market capitalization is supported by its non AI businesses. Estimates suggest Oracle's cloud infrastructure business could contribute approximately $13 per share to earnings by fiscal year 2027. This implies significant upside potential should the cloud infrastructure business approach its targets.",

If Polymarket (or any regulated on chain exchange) enters the U.S. with the same user experience but legal clarity, the old sportsbook model stops being competitive overnight.

      "selftext": "No paywall: [ >Macy’s on Wednesday beat Wall Street’s sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company’s turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum. >The department store operator raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook after its better-than-expected fiscal third quarter. The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $2 and $2.20, up from its previous expectation of $1.70 to $2.05, and net sales of $21.48 billion to $21.63 billion, compared with its prior outlook of $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion. >Macy’s said it expects flat to roughly 0.5% comparable sales growth from the previous year. That compares to its previous expectations for a year-over-year decline of between 0.5% and 1.5%. The industry metric takes out one-time dynamics like store openings and closures, and Macy’s includes merchandise that it owns, items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its third-party online marketplace. >It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy’s raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook. The company had cut its full-year earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs, more promotions and “some moderation” in discretionary spending. >Even so, the projected annual sales would represent a drop from the year-ago net sales of $22.29 billion. Macy’s said about $700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year, which ended Feb. 1, and in the early part of this fiscal year. >And Macy’s said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter. >Shares dropped about 6% in premarket trading on Wednesday. >In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a “prudent view” of the fourth quarter because it faces tough year-over-year comparisons and because it’s not sure how “aspirational customers,” those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured, may spend during the season. >“We’re pleased with the fourth quarter to date, but we have a big holiday in front of us,” he said. >He said Macy’s department store model is an advantage during the gift-giving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices, from off-price to luxury. >Here’s how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: >Earnings per share: 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents >Revenue: $4.71 billion vs. $4.62 billion expected >Macy’s is trying to put up better and more consistent sales, particularly for its namesake brand. Macy’s department stores account for the majority of the New York City-based legacy retailer’s business, but their performance has lagged behind the company’s higher-end department store, Bloomingdale’s, and beauty chain, Bluemercury. To try to reverse that trend, the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing, sharper merchandise and eye-catching displays at Macy’s stores. It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations, which were dubbed the “First 50,” and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy’s locations. That’s more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy’s plans to keep open. >Along with the added investment, it has shuttered lower-performing Macy’s locations. It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027, while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury. >The company hasn’t yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year. >In the three-month period that ended Nov. 1, Macy’s net income fell to $11 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $28 million, or 10 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for some one-time items, including gains on the sale of real estate, it reported earnings per share of 9 cents. >Revenue decreased from $4.74 billion in the year-ago quarter. >In the fiscal third quarter, companywide comparable sales rose 3.2% including owned and licensed merchandise and its third-party marketplace. When the company excluded stores that won’t be part of its go-forward business, that growth was 3.4%. >Bloomingdale’s posted the strongest performance of the company’s brands, with comparable sales jumping 9% year over year on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including its third-party marketplace. And Bluemercury’s comparable sales increased 1.1%. >Spring attributed the company’s better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy’s has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like high-end home goods company MacKenzie-Childs. >He said he visited Macy’s stores, and those of its competitors, on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw. >“I like the way we’re showing up,” he said. “We look crisp. We look clean. We look interesting, compelling, inspiring, easy to shop.” >The snap to cooler weather helped, too, he said. As temperatures turned cooler in October, shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters, outerwear and boots. >For the holiday season, Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the year-ago period at Macy’s stores and website, along with those of its competitors. >Higher tariffs, however, will mean higher prices for some items. Macy’s has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties, and the hit to margins in the third quarter came was lower than the company expected, he said. >Still, Spring said Macy’s has made “selective” price increases in almost every category, with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs. >As of Tuesday’s close, Macy’s shares have risen about 34% so far this year. That outpaces the S&P 500′s 16% gains during the same period. Macy’s stock closed Tuesday at $22.71, bringing the company’s market cap to about $6.10 billion.",

The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $ 2 and $ 2.20 up from its previous expectation of $ 1.70 to $ 2.05 and net sales of $ 21.48 billion to $ 21.63 billion compared with its prior outlook of $ 21.15 billion and $ 21.45 billion . Macy ’ s said it expects flat to roughly 0.5 % comparable sales growth from the previous year . That compares to its previous expectations for a yearoveryear decline of between 0.5 % and 1.5 % . The industry metric takes out onetime dynamics like store openings and closures and Macy ’ s includes merchandise that it owns items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its thirdparty online marketplace . It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy ’ s raised its fullyear sales and earnings outlook . The company had cut its fullyear earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs more promotions and “ some moderation ” in discretionary spending . Even so the projected annual sales would represent a drop from the yearago net sales of $ 22.29 billion . Macy ’ s said about $ 700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year which ended Feb. 1 and in the early part of this fiscal year . And Macy ’ s said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter . Shares dropped about 6 % in premarket trading on Wednesday . In an interview with CNBC CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a “ prudent view ” of the fourth quarter because it faces tough yearoveryear comparisons and because it ’ s not_sure how “ aspirational customers ” those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured may spend during the season . “ We ’ re pleased with the fourth quarter to date but we have a big holiday in front of us ” he said . He said Macy ’ s department store model is an advantage during the giftgiving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices from offprice to luxury . Here ’ s how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected based on a survey of analysts by LSEG Earnings per share 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents Revenue $ 4.71 billion vs. $ 4.62 billion expected Macy ’ s is trying to put up better and more consistent sales particularly for its namesake brand . Macy ’ s department stores account for the majority of the New York Citybased legacy retailer ’ s business but their performance has lagged behind the company ’ s higherend department store Bloomingdale ’ s and beauty chain Bluemercury . To try to reverse that trend the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing sharper merchandise and eyecatching displays at Macy ’ s stores . It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations which were dubbed the “ First 50 ” and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy ’ s locations . That ’ s more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy ’ s plans to keep open . Along with the added investment it has shuttered lowerperforming Macy ’ s locations . It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027 while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale ’ s and Bluemercury . The company hasn ’ t yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year . In the threemonth period that ended Nov. 1 Macy ’ s net income fell to $ 11 million or 4 cents per share compared with $ 28 million or 10 cents per share in the yearago period . Adjusting for some onetime items including gains on the sale of real estate it reported earnings per share of 9 cents . Revenue decreased from $ 4.74 billion in the yearago quarter . In the fiscal third quarter companywide comparable sales rose 3.2 % including owned and licensed merchandise and its thirdparty marketplace . When the company excluded stores that won ’ t be part of its goforward business that growth was 3.4 % . Bloomingdale ’ s posted the strongest performance of the company ’ s brands with comparable sales jumping 9 % year over year on an ownedpluslicensed basis including its thirdparty marketplace . And Bluemercury ’ s comparable sales increased 1.1 % . Spring attributed the company ’ s better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy ’ s has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like highend home goods company MacKenzieChilds . He said he visited Macy ’ s stores and those of its competitors on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw . “ I like the way we ’ re showing up ” he said . “ We look crisp . We look clean . We look interesting compelling inspiring easy to shop. ” The snap to cooler weather helped too he said . As temperatures turned cooler in October shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters outerwear and boots . For the holiday season Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the yearago period at Macy ’ s stores and website along with those of its competitors . Higher tariffs however will mean higher prices for some items . Macy ’ s has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties and the hit to margins in the third quarter came was lower than the company expected he said . Still Spring said Macy ’ s has made “ selective ” price increases in almost every category with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs . As of Tuesday ’ s close Macy ’ s shares have risen about 34 % so far this year . That outpaces the SP 500′s 16 % gains during the same period . Macy ’ s stock closed Tuesday at $ 22.71 bringing the company ’ s market cap to about $ 6.10 billion ."
