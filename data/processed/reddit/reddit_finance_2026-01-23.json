      "selftext": "It’s funny looking back at how many times people have panicked about the national debt. We freaked out at 1 trillion, then 5, then 10, 20, 30… every single milestone was supposed to be “the breaking point.” And nothing happened. Markets kept going, the dollar very volatile but always ended up OK even strong at points, the world keeps buying Treasuries. Even though headlines always said they will dump The big thing most people miss is that government debt doesn’t work like personal debt. Countries don’t pay it off like a credit card. They roll it over forever. What matters isn’t the number, it’s whether the world trusts your currency and wants your bonds. For the U.S., that answer is yes, and has been for decades. Treasuries are basically the plumbing of the entire global financial system. Banks, funds, foreign governments, the repo market, insurance companies, they all need Treasuries as collateral. If the U.S. ever stopped issuing debt, the global economy would actually fall apart. People don’t realize how central it is. And the U.S. issues debt in dollars. That alone changes the entire conversation. A country can’t “go bankrupt” on debt it owes in its own currency. The real constraint isn’t the debt number, it’s inflation and interest costs. As long as those are manageable, the size of the debt doesn’t mean much. Just a Number! Plus, every major country is in the same boat or worse. Japan is over 250 percent debt to GDP. Italy is around 140 percent. China has a massive pile of hidden local and off book debt. Nobody collapses because the modern financial world literally runs on this system. At the end of the day, the U.S. still has the reserve currency, the biggest capital markets, the most trusted debt, and the tech and military power that props the whole thing up. The debt number could be 60 trillion and people would still be buying Treasuries. So yeah, after freaking out at every milestone for 40 years, it’s pretty clear the number is mostly just a number. The structure underneath is what actually matters. Please explain what if I missed anything ??",

We freaked out at 1 trillion then 5 then 10 20 30… every single milestone was supposed to be “ the breaking point. ” And nothing_happened . Markets kept going the dollar very volatile but always ended up OK even strong at points the world keeps buying Treasuries . Even though headlines always said they will dump The big thing most people miss is that government debt doesn ’ t work like personal debt . Countries don ’ t pay it off like a credit card . They roll it over forever . What matters isn ’ t the number it ’ s whether the world trusts your currency and wants your bonds . For the U.S. that answer is yes and has been for decades . Treasuries are basically the plumbing of the entire global financial system . Banks funds foreign governments the repo market insurance companies they all need Treasuries as collateral . If the U.S. ever stopped issuing debt the global economy would actually fall apart . People don ’ t realize how central it is . And the U.S. issues debt in dollars . That alone changes the entire conversation . A country can ’ t “ go bankrupt ” on debt it owes in its own currency . The real constraint isn ’ t the debt number it ’ s inflation and interest costs . As long as those are manageable the size of the debt doesn ’ t mean much . Just a Number Plus every major country is in the same boat or worse . Japan is over 250 percent debt to GDP . Italy is around 140 percent . China has a massive pile of hidden local and off book debt . Nobody_collapses because the modern financial world literally runs on this system . At the end of the day the U.S. still has the reserve currency the biggest capital markets the most trusted debt and the tech and military power that props the whole thing up . The debt number could be 60 trillion and people would still be buying Treasuries . So yeah after freaking out at every milestone for 40 years it ’ s pretty clear the number is mostly just a number . The structure underneath is what actually matters . Please explain what if I missed anything"

      "selftext": "Without sharing too much personal information: I’m from a developing country with a long history of high inflation and economic instability. Because of this, it’s fairly common here for people to legally open an LLC in the US and keep their funds in reputable US banks, as protection against sudden political or economic changes that can wipe out savings overnight. This kind of thing has happened multiple times in the region over the last decades, so trust in local systems is understandably low. The issue is that, from my country, it’s not really possible to invest directly in global stock markets as an individual. The usual alternative is using local fintech platforms that offer “brokerage access” through their own US accounts, charging fees and effectively acting as both intermediary and custodian. Personally, I find this risky, since it means trusting a local third-party company to both hold and manage my funds, which in my context feels riskier than the investment itself. Given that, let’s assume I already have a properly formed US LLC with its own US bank account (for example, at Chase). What would be the correct process for that LLC to open an account with a legitimate US brokerage and start investing in US or global markets? I’d appreciate an ELI5-style explanation of the steps involved, any common pitfalls, and broker recommendations that work well with foreign-owned US LLCs. I have no issue complying with tax obligations on any gains. Thanks in advance, and apologies if my English isn’t perfect.",

      "selftext": "[]( MANAGEMENT IS NOT INSANE, THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS Dilution isn't *as* bad as it seems, as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year, but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing Snapchat glasses are releasing this year If the glasses fail and he scraps them, Snapchat saves roughly $1B a year in R&D, turns cash-flow positive, slows dilution, buys back more stock, and the market probably re-rates the company. If the glasses actually work, the upside is even bigger. Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never scrapped the project, but I believe this time is different. Looking back at 2016, this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no other tech giant had entered the arena. They rushed a product into a market that wasn’t ready, with technology that was too early for its time. The versions failed for simple reasons, including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn’t advanced enough. By 2021, while they finally had actual augmented reality, the battery life was horrible. One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $400 million/year deal with Perplexity. Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat, and this is huge for both companies. Young people love AI and they love Snapchat. It’s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity, likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year. It’s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity’s AI in its glasses. Another thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage. Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat+ for a small premium. This is huge, as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memory/storage features, and soon they will be charging for it. Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company, but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave. **Q2 2025 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): \\~$2.87 / 3 ≈ $0.96 per user per month** Snapchat+ is $3.99 per month. For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs, just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back. So the answer to my question is: yes, the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave, from a financial standpoint. And let’s be honest, the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal. They likely won’t save their photos to the app, but users will still use the app. One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don’t want to pay is that they’ll end up saving storage costs for the company, lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG. Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for “Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. We completed this program in May 2025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $500.6 million, including costs associated with the repurchases.” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2025, Snap had $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This means dilution, despite still being high, is much lower than what others are reporting. They bought back $500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025. RSUs were valued at $1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $1 billion in 2024–2025, which is by no means low, but it’s important to mention that no one mentions the buybacks. Numbers are better, everything from EPS, revenue is better then 2022, but the stock is down 50% from this time, primarily due to them burning cash (which will end once they release these glasses) and Apple's ad policy change Snapchat+ is growing steadily, making them 700 million/year A question many are asking is why Snapchat+ was released in 2022, yet the stock declined massively. This thought process is completely correct, but it’s important to look at why they’ve had massive drops during this time. Apple’s IDFA (privacy) changes, the post-pandemic tech stock drops, and the large cash burned on R&D were the main reasons for the stock dropping. However, a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money, and that they’re stepping away to other business models, which is huge. Snapchat is innovatingevery quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and non-paid subscribers. Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company, and Snapchat is not letting their app die.",

If the glasses actually work the upside is even bigger . Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never_scrapped the project but I believe this time is different . Looking back at 2016 this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no_other tech giant had entered the arena . They rushed a product into a market that wasn ’ t ready with technology that was too early for its time . The versions failed for simple reasons including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn ’ t advanced enough . By 2021 while they finally had actual augmented reality the battery life was horrible . One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $ 400 millionyear deal with Perplexity . Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat and this is huge for both companies . Young people love AI and they love Snapchat . It ’ s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year . It ’ s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity ’ s AI in its glasses . Another thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage . Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat for a small premium . This is huge as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memorystorage features and soon they will be charging for it . Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave . Q2 2025 ARPU Average Revenue Per User $ 2.87 3 ≈ $ 0.96 per user per month Snapchat is $ 3.99 per month . For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back . So the answer to my question is yes the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave from a financial standpoint . And let ’ s be honest the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal . They likely won ’ t save their photos to the app but users will still use the app . One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don ’ t want to pay is that they ’ ll end up saving storage costs for the company lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG . Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for “ Stock Repurchases In October 2024 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 500.0 million of our Class A common stock . We completed this program in May 2025 . For the nine months ended September 30 2025 we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $ 500.6 million including costs associated with the repurchases. ” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents . As of September 30 2025 Snap had $ 3.0 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities . This means dilution despite still being high is much lower than what others are reporting . They bought back $ 500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025 . RSUs were valued at $ 1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $ 1 billion in 2024–2025 which is by no_means low but it ’ s important to mention that no_one mentions the buybacks . Numbers are better everything from EPS revenue is better then 2022 but the stock is down 50 % from this time primarily due to them burning cash which will end once they release these glasses and Apples ad policy change Snapchat is growing steadily making them 700 millionyear A question many are asking is why Snapchat was released in 2022 yet the stock declined massively . This thought process is completely correct but it ’ s important to look at why they ’ ve had massive drops during this time . Apple ’ s IDFA privacy changes the postpandemic tech stock drops and the large cash burned on RD were the main reasons for the stock dropping . However a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money and that they ’ re stepping away to other business models which is huge . Snapchat is innovatingevery quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and nonpaid subscribers .

Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company, but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave. **Q2 2025 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): \\~$2.87 / 3 ≈ $0.96 per user per month** Snapchat+ is $3.99 per month.

Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for. Meta’s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms, unlike Snapchat’s, which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers; it’s not just a status thing. “Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock.

      "selftext_processed": "MANAGEMENT IS NOT_INSANE THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS Dilution isnt as bad as it seems as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing Snapchat glasses are releasing this year IT DOSENT MATTER IF THE GLASSES FLOP IT DOES NOT_IF IT FLOPS ITS GOOD EVEN If the glasses fail he will scraps them Snapchat will save roughly $ 1B a year in RD turns cashflow positive slows dilution buys back more stock and the market probably rerates the company . If the glasses actually work the upside is even bigger . Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never_scrapped the project but I believe this time is different . Looking back at 2016 this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no_other tech giant had entered the arena . They rushed a product into a market that wasn ’ t ready with technology that was too early for its time . The versions failed for simple reasons including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn ’ t advanced enough . By 2021 while they finally had actual augmented reality the battery life was horrible . One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $ 400 millionyear deal with Perplexity . Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat and this is huge for both companies . Young people love AI and they love Snapchat . It ’ s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year . It ’ s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity ’ s AI in its glasses . One thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage . Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat for a small premium . This is huge as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memorystorage features and soon they will be charging for it . Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave . Q2 2025 ARPU Average Revenue Per User $ 2.87 3 ≈ $ 0.96 per user per month Snapchat is $ 3.99 per month . For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back . So the answer to my question is yes the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave from a financial standpoint . And let ’ s be honest—the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal . They likely won ’ t save their photos to the app but users will still use the app . One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don ’ t want to pay is that they ’ ll end up saving storage costs for the company lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG . Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for . Meta ’ s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms unlike Snapchat ’ s which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers it ’ s not_just a status thing . “ Stock Repurchases In October 2024 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 500.0 million of our Class A common stock . We completed this program in May 2025 . For the nine months ended September 30 2025 we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $ 500.6 million including costs associated with the repurchases. ” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents . As of September 30 2025 Snap had $ 3.0 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities . This means dilution despite still being high is much lower than what others are reporting . They bought back $ 500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025 . RSUs were valued at $ 1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $ 1 billion in 2024–2025 which is by no_means low but it ’ s important to mention that no_one mentions the buybacks . Numbers are better everything from EPS revenue is better then 2022 but the stock is down 50 % from this time primarily due to them burning cash which will end once they release these glasses and Apples ad policy change Snapchat is growing steadily making them 700 millionyear A question many are asking is why Snapchat was released in 2022 yet the stock declined massively . This thought process is completely correct but it ’ s important to look at why they ’ ve had massive drops during this time . Apple ’ s IDFA privacy changes the postpandemic tech stock drops and the large cash burned on RD were the main reasons for the stock dropping . However a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money and that they ’ re stepping away to other business models which is huge . Snapchat is innovating—every quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and nonpaid subscribers . Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company and Snapchat is not_letting their app die ."

      "selftext": "Been investing for about 5 years now and I've noticed something weird about myself. I used to check my portfolio like 10 times a day, get stressed about red days, and try to time every little dip. My returns were mediocre. Then I realized I was basically gambling with a fundamental investing mindset, which is the worst combo. So I changed my approach. Instead of watching price action, I started tracking the stuff that actually moves markets long term. SEC filings, earnings calls, insider trades, congressional disclosures for companies I own. Sounds boring but it's genuinely changed how I think about my positions. Here's what I mean. I own some tech stocks and I used to panic when they'd drop 5% on some random Tuesday. But once I started actually reading the 10-Ks and 10-Qs, I realized most of those drops were noise. The fundamentals hadn't changed. On the flip side, I caught some early warning signs in other holdings by noticing patterns in insider selling that I would've completely missed if I was just staring at charts. The problem is this takes forever. I'm a software engineer so I'm used to automating stuff, and I got frustrated manually digging through SEC databases and trying to piece together what's actually happening with my holdings. That's when I realized how much of an advantage institutional investors have. They have teams of people doing this research. Retail investors like us are basically flying blind if we're just looking at price and volume. I started experimenting with different ways to streamline this. Tried a few different research tools and platforms. Some are clunky, some are expensive, some just regurgitate news headlines without any real insight. What actually helped was finding tools that could pull data from actual sources (SEC filings, exchange data, that kind of thing) and surface what's relevant to my specific holdings. Sounds simple but most tools just show you generic market news. Anyway, my point is this. If you're serious about fundamental investing, you need to actually know what's happening with your companies. Not the price, the actual business. And if you're like me and don't have 20 hours a week to dig through filings, you need to find a way to make that research efficient. Otherwise you're just guessing. My 1Y returns are up 29% and my 3Y average is 22%. I'm not saying that's because of this approach alone, but I'm definitely more confident in my positions now because I actually understand them. And I sleep better at night not checking my portfolio every 5 minutes. Anyone else struggle with this? How do you guys stay on top of the fundamentals without it consuming your entire life?",

      "selftext_processed": "Been investing for about 5 years now and Ive noticed something weird about myself . I used to check my portfolio like 10 times a day get stressed about red days and try to time every little dip . My returns were mediocre . Then I realized I was basically gambling with a fundamental investing mindset which is the worst combo . So I changed my approach . Instead of watching price action I started tracking the stuff that actually moves markets long term . SEC filings earnings calls insider trades congressional disclosures for companies I own . Sounds boring but its genuinely changed how I think about my positions . Heres what I mean . I own some tech stocks and I used to panic when theyd drop 5 % on some random Tuesday . But once I started actually reading the 10Ks and 10Qs I realized most of those drops were noise . The fundamentals hadnt changed . On the flip side I caught some early warning signs in other holdings by noticing patterns in insider selling that I wouldve completely missed if I was just staring at charts . The problem is this takes forever . Im a software engineer so Im used to automating stuff and I got frustrated manually digging through SEC databases and trying to piece together whats actually happening with my holdings . Thats when I realized how much of an advantage institutional investors have . They have teams of people doing this research . Retail investors like us are basically flying blind if were just looking at price and volume . I started experimenting with different ways to streamline this . Tried a few different research tools and platforms . Some are clunky some are expensive some just regurgitate news headlines without any real insight . What actually helped was finding tools that could pull data from actual sources SEC filings exchange data that kind of thing and surface whats relevant to my specific holdings . Sounds simple but most tools just show you generic market news . Anyway my point is this . If youre serious about fundamental investing you need to actually know whats happening with your companies . Not_the price the actual business . And if youre like me and dont have 20 hours a week to dig through filings you need to find a way to make that research efficient . Otherwise youre just guessing . My 1Y returns are up 29 % and my 3Y average is 22 % . Im not_saying thats because of this approach alone but Im definitely more confident in my positions now because I actually understand them . And I sleep better at night not_checking my portfolio every 5 minutes . Anyone else struggle with this How do you guys stay on top of the fundamentals without it consuming your entire life"

      "selftext": "**EDIT:** You guys rightfully tore me a mathematical asshole which I appreciate. After this post caught a little traction my 400 RKT shares magically appeared back into my account so maybe someone from RH saw this or they realized they fucked up, all is well now ________ This happened yesterday, January 21. I had 400 shares of RKT with an average price of $22.88. I was going to sell covered calls, I clicked the \"Trade\" button and saw the \"Ladder\" option which I had never seen before so wanted to check it out. This is the Ladder page on Robinhood As you can see the default setting is \"1 share\". I clicked \"Buy MKT\" to see how it worked and a popup came up saying something to the effect of 'Close and return' but I can't remember exactly what it said, I do know it said Close for sure and no buy or sell confirmation. I clicked it and the app immediately sold all 400 shares of my RKT stock at $21.28 resulting in a loss of -$651.50. After the trade happened I later checked the settings on the Ladder page and the \"Auto-send - Place orders without a confirmation\" was unchecked (it is by default) so I should've been to sent a confirmation page to confirm the order but I was not. Today I checked the Ladder page and now when you click \"Buy MKT\" it takes you to a totally separate page to confirm the order, input number of shares, set limit price, etc. I was not sent to this page yesterday. I spoke to RH support and was told they would talk to their back office to have the trade busted and my shares returned. I received an email today saying the back office was not able to bust the trade. Do I have any recourse here? I'm out 400 shares and -$651.50 directly caused by a bug on their app, isn't this a FINRA violation? Should I contact Robinhood again or file a complaint? Support chat and email I received: Chat: E-mail:",

After this post caught a little traction my 400 RKT shares magically appeared back into my account so maybe someone from RH saw this or they realized they fucked up all is well now ________ This happened yesterday January 21 . I had 400 shares of RKT with an average price of $ 22.88 . I was going to sell covered calls I clicked the Trade button and saw the Ladder option which I had never_seen before so wanted to check it out . This is the Ladder page on Robinhood As you can see the default setting is 1 share . I clicked Buy MKT to see how it worked and a popup came up saying something to the effect of Close and return but I cant remember exactly what it said I do know it said Close for sure and no_buy or sell confirmation . I clicked it and the app immediately sold all 400 shares of my RKT stock at $ 21.28 resulting in a loss of $ 651.50 . After the trade happened I later checked the settings on the Ladder page and the Autosend Place orders without a confirmation was unchecked it is by default so I shouldve been to sent a confirmation page to confirm the order but I was not_Today I checked the Ladder page and now when you click Buy MKT it takes you to a totally separate page to confirm the order input number of shares set limit price etc . I was not_sent to this page yesterday . I spoke to RH support and was told they would talk to their back office to have the trade busted and my shares returned . I received an email today saying the back office was not_able to bust the trade . Do I have any recourse here Im out 400 shares and $ 651.50 directly caused by a bug on their app isnt this a FINRA violation Should I contact Robinhood again or file a complaint Support chat and email I received Chat Email"

      "selftext": "As English is not my first language, I have used Gemini to help me. But you know what, see the positions first, cause that is all you degens care about and now the part which 99% of you guys wont read: So I have been digging through the biotech trash heap looking for gold, and I think I found the only ticker that Mr. Market is completely sleeping on. We are talking about **Altimmune ($ALT)**. If you’ve been watching the GLP-1 space (Lilly, Novo), you know the \"fat loss\" trade is crowded. But $ALT just pivoted to the holy grail: **MASH (liver disease) + Weight Loss.** And the setup right now is looking like a powder keg waiting for a match. Here is the DD. # 1. The Data is absolute fire (FDA Agrees) The market punished this thing last year because they wanted \"just another weight loss drug.\" $ALT gave them something better: **Pemvidutide.** * **BTD CONFIRMED:** As of Jan 5, 2026, the FDA granted them **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)** for MASH. This is huge. It means the FDA sees \"substantial improvement\" over existing therapies. This is also means chances of approval are now over 75%, FDA wants this drug **LET ME SAY THIS IN CAPS - BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL, only around 1/3 of applications gets accepted, and it tells big Pharma, FDA wants this drug, come fucking buy** * **The Kicker:** Unlike Madrigal’s drug (Rezdiffra) which just treats the liver, $ALT’s drug shreds fat too. Patients hit **7.5% weight loss at 48 weeks** on the high dose, and the chart showed *no plateau* (meaning they were still losing weight). It’s a two-for-one special: Fix the liver, lose the gut. # 2. The \"For Sale\" Sign is Blinking This is the most bullish part. Look at the C-Suite changes. They aren't building a 20-year dynasty; they are dressing the bride for a wedding. * **New CEO (Jan 2026):** Jerry Durso. Who is he? He was the CEO of Intercept Pharmaceuticals. **He literally just sold Intercept to Alfasigma.** He knows exactly how to package a liver drug for a buyout. * **New CFO (Nov 2024):** Greg Weaver. This guy was the CFO at Sirna (sold to Merck) and ILEX (sold to Genzyme). * **Translation:** You don't hire a liquidation squad if you plan to run independent trials for the next decade. # 3. Valuation is a Joke (The Value Play) Let’s look at the comps. This is why it’s the best value on the board. * **Madrigal ($MDGL):** Multi-Billion market cap. (Commercial stage, but expensive). * **Viking ($VKTX):** \\~$8B+ market cap. * Novo also got some company in this space for billions * **Altimmune ($ALT):** **\\~$450M - $550M Market Cap.** It is trading at cash + a handshake. If this gets even *half* the valuation of its peers, it’s a multi-bagger. The Phase 3 setup is fully aligned with the FDA. The ship is loaded. # 4. The Catalyst & The Risk * **The Hype:** The stock started heating up at the JPM Healthcare Conference (Jan 2026). Big Pharma is swimming in cash and looking for MASH assets because their patents are expiring. * **The Risk (The Bear Case):** Cash. They have \\~$210M (as of late 2025). Phase 3 is expensive. * *Scenario A:* They dilute. Stock dips, we cry, then it recovers. * *Scenario B:* Partnership (Non-dilutive cash). Stock moons. * *Scenario C:* Buyout. We retire. # Summary They have the **Data** (BTD granted), they have the **Management** (literally hired guys who sell companies), and they have the **Market Cap** (insanely low compared to peers). This isn't a pure obesity play anymore; it's the leading **MASH play** that makes you skinny. **TL;DR:** * **Ticker:** $ALT * **Catalyst:** FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation + Phase 3 start. * **Upside:** 3-5x to catch up to peer valuations. * **Risk:** Cash burn/Dilution (unless they partner/sell first). * **Prediction:** Jerry Durso didn't take this job to work a 9-5. He took it to sign a deal. bonus - 21% SI Not financial advice, but this could 2x to 10x , who the hell knows, but is should fly baby fly It ran 20 percent today for a reason.... Many people saying AI bots. Check my history, I am as degen and idiotic as any other regard. Now who comments on the threads, I can't control.",

      "selftext_processed": "As English is not_my first language I have used Gemini to help me . But you know what see the positions first cause that is all you degens care about and now the part which 99 % of you guys wont read So I have been digging through the biotech trash heap looking for gold and I think I found the only ticker that Mr. Market is completely sleeping on . We are talking about Altimmune $ ALT . If you ’ ve been watching the GLP1 space Lilly Novo you know the fat loss trade is crowded . But $ ALT just pivoted to the holy grail MASH liver disease Weight Loss . And the setup right now is looking like a powder keg waiting for a match . Here is the DD . 1 . The Data is absolute fire FDA Agrees The market punished this thing last year because they wanted just another weight loss drug . $ ALT gave them something better Pemvidutide . BTD CONFIRMED As of Jan 5 2026 the FDA granted them Breakthrough Therapy Designation BTD for MASH . This is huge . It means the FDA sees substantial improvement over existing therapies . This is also means chances of approval are now over 75 % FDA wants this drug LET ME SAY THIS IN CAPS BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL only around 13 of applications gets accepted and it tells big Pharma FDA wants this drug come fucking buy The Kicker Unlike Madrigal ’ s drug Rezdiffra which just treats the liver $ ALT ’ s drug shreds fat too . Patients hit 7.5 % weight loss at 48 weeks on the high dose and the chart showed no plateau meaning they were still losing weight . It ’ s a twoforone special Fix the liver lose the gut . 2 . The For Sale Sign is Blinking This is the most bullish part . Look at the CSuite changes . They arent building a 20year dynasty they are dressing the bride for a wedding . New CEO Jan 2026 Jerry Durso . Who is he He was the CEO of Intercept Pharmaceuticals . He literally just sold Intercept to Alfasigma . He knows exactly how to package a liver drug for a buyout . New CFO Nov 2024 Greg Weaver . This guy was the CFO at Sirna sold to Merck and ILEX sold to Genzyme . Translation You dont hire a liquidation squad if you plan to run independent trials for the next decade . 3 . Valuation is a Joke The Value Play Let ’ s look at the comps . This is why it ’ s the best value on the board . Madrigal $ MDGL MultiBillion market cap . Commercial stage but expensive . Viking $ VKTX $ 8B market cap . Novo also got some company in this space for billions Altimmune $ ALT $ 450M $ 550M Market Cap . It is trading at cash a handshake . If this gets even half the valuation of its peers it ’ s a multibagger . The Phase 3 setup is fully aligned with the FDA . The ship is loaded . 4 . The Catalyst The Risk The Hype The stock started heating up at the JPM Healthcare Conference Jan 2026 . Big Pharma is swimming in cash and looking for MASH assets because their patents are expiring . The Risk The Bear Case Cash . They have $ 210M as of late 2025 . Phase 3 is expensive . Scenario A They dilute . Stock dips we cry then it recovers . Scenario B Partnership Nondilutive cash . Stock moons . Scenario C Buyout . We retire . Summary They have the Data BTD granted they have the Management literally hired guys who sell companies and they have the Market Cap insanely low compared to peers . This isnt a pure obesity play anymore its the leading MASH play that makes you skinny . TLDR Ticker $ ALT Catalyst FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation Phase 3 start . Upside 35x to catch up to peer valuations . Risk Cash burnDilution unless they partnersell first . Prediction Jerry Durso didnt take this job to work a 95 . He took it to sign a deal . bonus 21 % SI Not_financial advice but this could 2x to 10x who the hell knows but is should fly baby fly It ran 20 percent today for a reason .... Many people saying AI bots . Check my history I am as degen and idiotic as any other regard . Now who comments on the threads I cant control ."

EPS for last quarter came in at $.15, significantly topping estiates of $.08. Revenue of $13.67 billion topped estimates of about $13.4 billion. The results for last quarter look solid.

      "selftext": "After conducting several rounds of expert calls with the meteorological expert panel known as chatgpt, claude & gemini, as well as analyzing the latest weather models from anime pfp's on twitter, I have arrived at the conclusion that America's energy infrastructure is about to be hit by the Mother Of All Snow Storms (MOASS). As a great American once said, never let a good crisis go to waste. To figure out how to capitalize on this opportunity, I looked to the work of this highly helpful Texas Consumer Association NGO that explains the \"massive windfall key industry players made during the freeze. **Energy Transfer posted its highest quarterly net income on record**, more than three times its previous best quarter\". [ $ET made a killing off Winter Storm Uri in 2021, thanks to a massive energy storage and logistics network of assets that was primed to capitalize on market dislocations from the crisis. Just look at their CEO, I am sure glad to be on his side of the table on these energy deals. I am betting on a repeat of the 2021 bonanza over this weekend, hence the yolo. Disclosures: I am not a financial professional, my own findings and financial decisions were made based on AI slop and trust me bro twitter research, and should not be the basis for anyone else's decisions.",

As a great American once said never_let a good crisis go to waste . To figure out how to capitalize on this opportunity I looked to the work of this highly helpful Texas Consumer Association NGO that explains the massive windfall key industry players made during the freeze . Energy Transfer posted its highest quarterly net income on record more than three times its previous best quarter . $ ET made a killing off Winter Storm Uri in 2021 thanks to a massive energy storage and logistics network of assets that was primed to capitalize on market dislocations from the crisis . Just look at their CEO I am sure glad to be on his side of the table on these energy deals . I am betting on a repeat of the 2021 bonanza over this weekend hence the yolo . Disclosures I am not_a financial professional my own findings and financial decisions were made based on AI slop and trust me bro twitter research and should not_be the basis for anyone elses decisions ."

But some of these ETFs claim to have \"the top 100 global companies\", but then something like Exxon Mobil will be in the top 10, when it's really more like #20, so it's deceiving or at least not immediately clear what they are using to rank the weights of their holdings. I know I can just look up like Morningstar or Fidelity reports on their holdings, but is there like some website or tool I can use to just type how many shares I have of each stock and ETF, and then it pulls the current prices and % holdings of the ETFs to calculate what the percentage makeup of your portfolio is? I just want to better understand what's in my portfolio and what's not at a glance. I can't find anything that does this.",

I know I can just look up like Morningstar or Fidelity reports on their holdings but is there like some website or tool I can use to just type how many shares I have of each stock and ETF and then it pulls the current prices and % holdings of the ETFs to calculate what the percentage makeup of your portfolio is I just want to better understand whats in my portfolio and whats not_at a glance . I cant find anything that does this ."

I’m currently low on cash in my bank account to finish paying the rest of it off. I have a RH brokerage account that holds \\~20% VOO and the rest of it is individual stocks (TSM, WMT, RKLB, etc). I use this account to hold onto stocks long term. If I sell all of my VOO, I will have enough money to pay off the rest of the ring. I plan on getting back into S&P 500 exposure either through my job’s 401K plan or a Roth IRA. Or would it be better to hold VOO and sell some of the individual stocks I own? Please let me know what you guys think. Thank you! Edit: Want to clarify here since a lot of people are asking: the engagement ring is a lab grown diamond ring, only need $2,000 to pay off the rest of it, which is about how much I have in VOO.

      "selftext": "As of writing this post gold is \\~$4900/oz and platinum is \\~$2550/oz. Platinum is estimated to be 30x rarer than gold, why is it 1/2 the cost? Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years. It has constant demand from central banks and will always be seen as the go to as a safe haven. There will always be a premium for it but 200% relative to platinum, a scarcer mineral, seems excessive. Silver I think is more comparable to platinum, it isn’t viewed in the same light as gold and doesn’t deserve the premium gold has. Yet silver has surged more than platinum, why? Perhaps it’s due to it being a cheaper alternative to gold but for every 1 oz of platinum mined there are 139 oz of silver mined. Based solely on that, silver is \\~$96, making platinum 26x more expensive. It surely has room to grow higher based only on scarcity. Platinum is primarily used in the automotive industry for catalytic converters. This provides a baseline demand and the market has seen a significant supply deficit for the past few years. Solely on this, the supply constraints will push up prices. There’s also growth as it’s used in hydrogen fuel cells as AI demands an increase in power outputs. The world spending on defence is also projected to increase due to Trump and it’s also used in manufacturing for various defence products. I see an opportunity for price increases due to scarcity and use case growth with limited downside due to baseline demand not even being met.

It has constant demand from central banks and will always be seen as the go to as a safe haven . There will always be a premium for it but 200 % relative to platinum a scarcer mineral seems excessive . Silver I think is more comparable to platinum it isn ’ t viewed in the same light as gold and doesn ’ t deserve the premium gold has . Yet silver has surged more than platinum why Perhaps it ’ s due to it being a cheaper alternative to gold but for every 1 oz of platinum mined there are 139 oz of silver mined . Based solely on that silver is $ 96 making platinum 26x more expensive . It surely has room to grow higher based only on scarcity . Platinum is primarily used in the automotive industry for catalytic converters . This provides a baseline demand and the market has seen a significant supply deficit for the past few years . Solely on this the supply constraints will push up prices . There ’ s also growth as it ’ s used in hydrogen fuel cells as AI demands an increase in power outputs . The world spending on defence is also projected to increase due to Trump and it ’ s also used in manufacturing for various defence products . I see an opportunity for price increases due to scarcity and use case growth with limited downside due to baseline demand not_even being met .

      "selftext": "Cavvy Energy (CVVY.TO), a Canadian energy company, has been locked in a awful contract for years. This deal required 80% of their sulphur production to be sold at $6/mt. Compare that to the current market value of $260/mt, and you can see how awful this deal is. This has meant Cavvy received an average of $34/mt for their sulphur last quarter against the $260/mt they could've gotten. This changes this year. In November, they entered into a new contract, wherein 1/3 of their suplhur will be sold at $225/mt, 1/3 between $205-$250/mt, and 1/3 at full market value. Averaged out, this'd put the price they get at around $250/mt, or 7.3x what they got last quarter. Cavvy currently produces around 1,100 mt/d, but can expand that to 1,400 mt/d at peak periods. Averaged at 1200 mt/d, it means Cavvy currently receives around $14M a year from sulphur, but with the new deal would be getting around $100M a year (perhaps slightly less when factoring in costs of sulphur storage and transfer, which the current $34/mt accounts for). Last year, Cavvy made around $30M a quarter in total NOI, across all areas of their business: already a significant increase from the year before. Accounting for the new suplhur pricing, they could be adding $20M per quarter to that number, or around +60% compared to last year, or a total $200M NOI compared to $120M (although yearly figures seem to shift quite a lot for Cavvy, so it may not be indicative). They've been working down their debt every quarter, to currently $160M. The large uptick in revenue would certainly help clear that faster. Their net income per quarter often brushes break-even, or dips into the negatives somewhat, but this revenue increase should put them comfortably above 0. It seems like they'll break even for last year, which again, should put them in the green this year. At C$260M cap at the moment, it wouldn't take much profit to make them undervalued. The stock's already up 200% in the past year, and I think it could go higher. I will note that what values are in USD$ or Canadian $ is a bit blurry. The suplhur market price is in USD, but the market cap in C$, so numbers may vary a little.",

      "selftext_processed": "Cavvy Energy CVVY.TO a Canadian energy company has been locked in a awful contract for years . This deal required 80 % of their sulphur production to be sold at $ 6mt . Compare that to the current market value of $ 260mt and you can see how awful this deal is . This has meant Cavvy received an average of $ 34mt for their sulphur last quarter against the $ 260mt they couldve gotten . This changes this year . In November they entered into a new contract wherein 13 of their suplhur will be sold at $ 225mt 13 between $ 205 $ 250mt and 13 at full market value . Averaged out thisd put the price they get at around $ 250mt or 7.3x what they got last quarter . Cavvy currently produces around 1100 mtd but can expand that to 1400 mtd at peak periods . Averaged at 1200 mtd it means Cavvy currently receives around $ 14M a year from sulphur but with the new deal would be getting around $ 100M a year perhaps slightly less when factoring in costs of sulphur storage and transfer which the current $ 34mt accounts for . Last year Cavvy made around $ 30M a quarter in total NOI across all areas of their business already a significant increase from the year before . Accounting for the new suplhur pricing they could be adding $ 20M per quarter to that number or around 60 % compared to last year or a total $ 200M NOI compared to $ 120M although yearly figures seem to shift quite a lot for Cavvy so it may not_be indicative . Theyve been working down their debt every quarter to currently $ 160M . The large uptick in revenue would certainly help clear that faster . Their net income per quarter often brushes breakeven or dips into the negatives somewhat but this revenue increase should put them comfortably above 0 . It seems like theyll break even for last year which again should put them in the green this year . At C $ 260M cap at the moment it wouldnt take much profit to make them undervalued . The stocks already up 200 % in the past year and I think it could go higher . I will note that what values are in USD $ or Canadian $ is a bit blurry . The suplhur market price is in USD but the market cap in C $ so numbers may vary a little ."

      "selftext": "# The Monetization of Inertia: Why Davos 2026 wasn't a capitulation, but a signal that Microsoft is winning by servicing corporate inefficiency rather than fixing it. Davos 2026 take: Microsoft isn't \"slowing down.\" They are winning by letting corporate inertia kill SaaS. Everyone is talking about how \"depressing\" or \"pragmatic\" Nadella sounded at Davos this year. The narrative seems to be that the AI revolution is hitting a wall of supply-side issues or just slowing down. I think that's a total misread. I’ve been looking at the drop in SaaS valuations (Salesforce, Workday, Asana) vs Microsoft’s positioning, and honestly, MSFT isn't winning because their AI is \"smarter.\" They are winning because they are monetizing the fact that huge companies are too dysfunctional to change. Here is what I’m seeing: **1. The \"Middle-Management Firewall\"** We all thought AI would come in and optimize inefficiencies. But in the real world (logistics, law, old-school manufacturing), the data is such a mess that AI models just choke on it. Instead of fixing the data, companies are just buying Copilot to layer on top of the mess. It’s not a revolution; it’s a patch. Microsoft realized they don't need to fix the enterprise; they just need to tax its inefficiency. **2. SaaS is bleeding out** The whole \"seat-based\" pricing model is dying. You used to pay for Asana or Salesforce so humans could click buttons to manage work. But if AI agents start doing the work, you don't need the GUI. You need the API and the data. Microsoft owns the OS and the data layer (Graph/Office). The \"middleman\" apps that just manage complexity are losing their moat. That’s why their stocks are tanking while MSFT holds. **3. Legacy is the Moat** This is the most contrarian part: The sheer ugliness of legacy infrastructure (VBA macros, old ERPs, unstructured PDFs) is actually a defense mechanism. Agile AI startups can't integrate with this garbage. Microsoft can, because they built half of it. They are effectively selling \"safety\" to dinosaurs who are too scared to rebuild their stack. **My take:** This isn't a tech stagnation. It's a shift from a war of maneuver (startups breaking things) to a war of attrition. Microsoft is digging in. The \"inertia\" of the Global 2000 companies is the biggest asset class in the world right now, and Nadella is the only one servicing it. Thoughts? Is legacy debt a long-term moat or just a temporary speed bump before agents eat everything? *I wrote this because I believe we are missing the structural shift while focusing on rhetoric. Wondering if this \"inertia as defense\" is a temporary speedbump or the permanent state of our high-tech stagnation.*",

      "selftext_processed": "The Monetization of Inertia Why Davos 2026 wasnt a capitulation but a signal that Microsoft is winning by servicing corporate inefficiency rather than fixing it . Davos 2026 take Microsoft isnt slowing down . They are winning by letting corporate inertia kill SaaS . Everyone is talking about how depressing or pragmatic Nadella sounded at Davos this year . The narrative seems to be that the AI revolution is hitting a wall of supplyside issues or just slowing down . I think thats a total misread . I ’ ve been looking at the drop in SaaS valuations Salesforce Workday Asana vs Microsoft ’ s positioning and honestly MSFT isnt winning because their AI is smarter . They are winning because they are monetizing the fact that huge companies are too dysfunctional to change . Here is what I ’ m seeing 1 . The MiddleManagement Firewall We all thought AI would come in and optimize inefficiencies . But in the real world logistics law oldschool manufacturing the data is such a mess that AI models just choke on it . Instead of fixing the data companies are just buying Copilot to layer on top of the mess . It ’ s not_a revolution it ’ s a patch . Microsoft realized they dont need to fix the enterprise they just need to tax its inefficiency . 2 . SaaS is bleeding out The whole seatbased pricing model is dying . You used to pay for Asana or Salesforce so humans could click buttons to manage work . But if AI agents start doing the work you dont need the GUI . You need the API and the data . Microsoft owns the OS and the data layer GraphOffice . The middleman apps that just manage complexity are losing their moat . That ’ s why their stocks are tanking while MSFT holds . 3 . Legacy is the Moat This is the most contrarian part The sheer ugliness of legacy infrastructure VBA macros old ERPs unstructured PDFs is actually a defense mechanism . Agile AI startups cant integrate with this garbage . Microsoft can because they built half of it . They are effectively selling safety to dinosaurs who are too scared to rebuild their stack . My take This isnt a tech stagnation . Its a shift from a war of maneuver startups breaking things to a war of attrition . Microsoft is digging in . The inertia of the Global 2000 companies is the biggest asset class in the world right now and Nadella is the only one servicing it . Thoughts Is legacy debt a longterm moat or just a temporary speed bump before agents eat everything I wrote this because I believe we are missing the structural shift while focusing on rhetoric . Wondering if this inertia as defense is a temporary speedbump or the permanent state of our hightech stagnation ."

If anything, markets seem to be pricing *less immediate downside*, not new certainty. There has been a lot of noise around geopolitics, trade rhetoric, and election-related risk, but no concrete policy shifts or confirmed deals that materially change the macro outlook. Tariff risks for Europe haven’t been removed, and broader trade uncertainty is still very much on the table. What likely supported stocks was positioning and rates. Bond yields stayed contained, volatility remained muted, and there was no catalyst forcing risk-off behavior. In that environment, even modest dip-buying can push indices higher. To me this looks more like patience than confidence. Markets aren’t panicking, but they’re also not celebrating. Until we see real policy clarity or stronger macro data, this feels like a range-bound grind where headline risk remains asymmetric. Interested how others read it.

The FDA just approved Mounjaro and Zepbound in Kwikpen and MultiDose vials . The Kwikpen has been available in international markets but they will offer them here in the states presumably for Medicare and Medicaid coverage . The most interesting thing is the MultiDose vial . This one is likely for LillyDirect and a shot across the bow to compounders . With a MultiDose vial you can now personalize your dosing with the branded drug . Mounjaro Zepbound"

      "title": "$ATEX A Play on Exclusive Rights to Smart Grid Radiocommunications Wavelength & Modernisation Needs",
      "selftext": "I'll preface this by saying, this is a play on increases in mass energy needs, the need for grid modernisation as a result, and the underlying processes that allow Smart Grids to operate. Anterix (ATEX) is a deep-value play on Smart Grids' needs for critical radio frequency communication. \\*\\***As of writing, ATEX holds the exclusive nationwide license for the 900 MHz band, a specialised frequency critical for the multi-trillion dollar US grid modernisation**.\\*\\* The current market cap sits at approximately $473 million, with the spectrum pipeline valued at nearly $3B across 60+ potential utility customers. Financial filings reveal a pivot toward profitability, with the company reporting a stellar EPS of $2.86 and increasing projected cash proceeds to $100 million from the previous $80 million guidance. On a business metrics and stock mathematics level, there is a significant valuation gap and a debt-free balance sheet. ATEX currently trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 4.9x, a solid discount compared to the telecom industry average of \\~16x. This undervaluation is further apparent when considering the company’s $250 million authorised share repurchase program, which remains active through to September 2026. \\***As of the most recent filings, over $227 million remains on this authorisation - a figure representing nearly 48% of the company's total market capitalisation**.\\* This suggests that as Anterix continues to execute its monetisation strategy, it has the liquidity to significantly reduce its share count, effectively creating a buyback floor that amplifies per-share value as revenue from long-term utility contracts scales. From a technical and operational standpoint, the turnaround is validated by accelerating contracted proceeds and strategic de-risking. The company has moved from a development phase into an execution phase, evidenced by the $147 million in contracted proceeds already on the books and the launch of TowerX with Crown Castle to speed up utility deployments. The stock chart reflects this momentum; after bottoming in late 2025 near $18, ATEX has established a strong ascending channel, with current technical support firming up around $23.50 - $24.00. With $39 million in cash and zero debt, Anterix is positioned to navigate the lumpy nature of spectrum deals while waiting for the market to re-rate its share price toward a fair value consensus of $50 - $55, which aligns with conservative spectrum-valuation methodologies of \\~$0.40/MHz-pop. \\*\\*Wireless Company Valuation\\*\\* *Conservative* If one applies a conservative $0.40/MHz pop math to Anterix’s nationwide footprint: 2.0 Billion MHz-pops x $0.40 = $800 Million (Spectrum Value) Add: \\~$40M Cash + \\~$140M in Contracted Receivables. Subtract: liabilities/burn. Divide by: \\~18-19 million shares. This calculation results in a price per share in the $50 range *Bull* At (already in contract with SDG&E) $2/MHz pop, this valuation quickly shifts to $200-250/ps Entry: $23-26 Target: $65 LFG 🍀🥸",

      "selftext_processed": "Ill preface this by saying this is a play on increases in mass energy needs the need for grid modernisation as a result and the underlying processes that allow Smart Grids to operate . Anterix ATEX is a deepvalue play on Smart Grids needs for critical radio frequency communication . As of writing ATEX holds the exclusive nationwide license for the 900 MHz band a specialised frequency critical for the multitrillion dollar US grid modernisation . The current market cap sits at approximately $ 473 million with the spectrum pipeline valued at nearly $ 3B across 60 potential utility customers . Financial filings reveal a pivot toward profitability with the company reporting a stellar EPS of $ 2.86 and increasing projected cash proceeds to $ 100 million from the previous $ 80 million guidance . On a business metrics and stock mathematics level there is a significant valuation gap and a debtfree balance sheet . ATEX currently trades at a trailing PE ratio of 4.9x a solid discount compared to the telecom industry average of 16x . This undervaluation is further apparent when considering the company ’ s $ 250 million authorised share repurchase program which remains active through to September 2026 . As of the most recent filings over $ 227 million remains on this authorisation a figure representing nearly 48 % of the companys total market capitalisation . This suggests that as Anterix continues to execute its monetisation strategy it has the liquidity to significantly reduce its share count effectively creating a buyback floor that amplifies pershare value as revenue from longterm utility contracts scales . From a technical and operational standpoint the turnaround is validated by accelerating contracted proceeds and strategic derisking . The company has moved from a development phase into an execution phase evidenced by the $ 147 million in contracted proceeds already on the books and the launch of TowerX with Crown Castle to speed up utility deployments . The stock chart reflects this momentum after bottoming in late 2025 near $ 18 ATEX has established a strong ascending channel with current technical support firming up around $ 23.50 $ 24.00 . With $ 39 million in cash and zero debt Anterix is positioned to navigate the lumpy nature of spectrum deals while waiting for the market to rerate its share price toward a fair value consensus of $ 50 $ 55 which aligns with conservative spectrumvaluation methodologies of $ 0.40MHzpop . Wireless Company Valuation Conservative If one applies a conservative $ 0.40MHz pop math to Anterix ’ s nationwide footprint 2.0 Billion MHzpops x $ 0.40 $ 800 Million Spectrum Value Add $ 40M Cash $ 140M in Contracted Receivables . Subtract liabilitiesburn . Divide by 1819 million shares . This calculation results in a price per share in the $ 50 range Bull At already in contract with SDGE $ 2MHz pop this valuation quickly shifts to $ 200250ps Entry $ 2326 Target $ 65 LFG 🍀🥸"

Notably, this rally wasn't a market-wide one. It was driven by major AI and robotics companies, including Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Hyundai Motor Company. This is interpreted as a concentrated rally driven by increased global AI investment and momentum in the semiconductor market, rather than a general market uptrend. I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Does this leading movement signal market strength, or does it raise concerns about market narrowness? I invested in a KOSPI index tracking ETF.",

      "selftext": "(I’m long on Nvidia and a dozen other major AI related stocks. I’m also in various S&P positions and funds. Just a disclaimer.) Congress is one step closer to gaining the authority to review artificial intelligence chip sales to China, a move likely to open a rift with the Trump administration over plans to let Nvidia Corp. sell its powerful H200 processors to the world’s second largest economy. A House committee focused on foreign affairs approved bipartisan legislation Wednesday that calls for arms-sale style congressional oversight of advanced AI chip exports. The text, endorsed by the panel’s Republicans and Democrats, would outright ban sales of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips to China for two years, codifying existing export controls into law. The bill marks a response to President Donald Trump’s decision last month to ease longstanding export controls on China, a move aimed at spurring adoption of American AI technology in global markets but one that drew strenuous objections from national security hawks in Congress. Trump’s approval for Nvidia’s H200 sales to Chinese customers was formalized by a new rule issued last week by the Commerce Department. The panel approved the bill by a 42-2 margin. It now heads to the House for a floor vote. The Senate has yet to release a companion version, but lawmakers there have introduced a separate bill that would effectively block H200 sales. Under the legislation, the administration would be required to notify Congress of advanced AI chip sales before they’re approved, giving lawmakers the power to review and block export licenses to China, Russia, Iran, and other adversaries through a joint resolution. The measure calls for allowing members of House Foreign Affairs and Senate Banking committees to see the numbers of chips up for export as well as the end-users buying them. It also creates a way for so-called “trusted” AI companies to receive license exemptions when sending chips to US allies and neutral countries, an approach commended by Microsoft Corp. executive Fred Humphries, and requires the administration to submit a strategy on its policy for maintaining the US lead in the AI race. Spokespeople for Nvidia didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Congress is one step closer to gaining the authority to review artificial intelligence chip sales to China a move likely to open a rift with the Trump administration over plans to let Nvidia Corp. sell its powerful H200 processors to the world ’ s second largest economy . A House committee focused on foreign affairs approved bipartisan legislation Wednesday that calls for armssale style congressional oversight of advanced AI chip exports . The text endorsed by the panel ’ s Republicans and Democrats would outright ban sales of Nvidia ’ s Blackwell chips to China for two years codifying existing export controls into law . The bill marks a response to President Donald Trump ’ s decision last month to ease longstanding export controls on China a move aimed at spurring adoption of American AI technology in global markets but one that drew strenuous objections from national security hawks in Congress . Trump ’ s approval for Nvidia ’ s H200 sales to Chinese customers was formalized by a new rule issued last week by the Commerce Department . The panel approved the bill by a 422 margin . It now heads to the House for a floor vote . The Senate has yet to release a companion version but lawmakers there have introduced a separate bill that would effectively block H200 sales . Under the legislation the administration would be required to notify Congress of advanced AI chip sales before they ’ re approved giving lawmakers the power to review and block export licenses to China Russia Iran and other adversaries through a joint resolution . The measure calls for allowing members of House Foreign Affairs and Senate Banking committees to see the numbers of chips up for export as well as the endusers buying them . It also creates a way for socalled “ trusted ” AI companies to receive license exemptions when sending chips to US allies and neutral countries an approach commended by Microsoft Corp. executive Fred Humphries and requires the administration to submit a strategy on its policy for maintaining the US lead in the AI race . Spokespeople for Nvidia didn ’ t immediately respond to a request for comment ."

      "selftext": "Hey guys, so I am trying to figure out the proper way to do a stock and bond balance. I am currently 24 and have a ROTH IRA that is at 15k and fully invested in VT. I am planning on adding bonds when I get to 40 or so. At 40 I am thinking to get to 10% bonds, then increase by 1% each ear until I am at 30% at 60. I know that is is best to have bonds in a traditional IRA and keep the ROTH 100% VT. The problem I've been thinking about is when I'm 40, lets say the ROTH is at 100k or something with me contributing the max each year. If I just start the bonds at that point in a traditional IRA, how could I get the traditional to 10K? I know you cannot transfer funds from a ROTH to traditional, and the contribution limit is around 7k shared between both of them. I was thinking maybe if I get a 401k(which I dont currently have) I could transfer that to a traditional with funds already in there. It would be nice to just immediately transfer 10% of the funds from VT to bonds, but this doesn't seem possible between a ROTH and traditional. This all seems like a headache. What is the best way to go about the bond and stock balance?",

      "selftext": "**The 30-year backstory** Japan's economy melted down in 1990 with the popping of a huge real estate and equity bubble. To restore the economy, Japan pioneered the playbook central banks now run everywhere: slash interest rates to zero, then buy massive quantities of your own government bonds. This creates artificial demand that pushes yields (aka borrowing costs) even lower. It's a bit like your left pocket owing money to your right pocket. And being able to print money to pay it back. It let Japan run up the largest debt in the world. 1.3 quadrillion yen to be exact. That's quadrillion with a Q. It also opened up an obvious trade. If you can borrow money for free, and put it in something yielding 4, 5, 6%... you've found an infinite money glitch. Japanese investors plowed into US treasury bills. This made them the largest holder of US treasuries, with $1.2 trillion. The rest went into tech stocks and anything else going up. This worked great for thirty years until COVID. Governments were forced to print money en masse, and inflation finally arrived. Japan's playbook worked when inflation was dead. But when it finally came back and prices started rising, printing money would make it worse. So Japan has had to stop printing money, and raise rates. **The $1.2 trillion dollar question** So the reason people are freaking out about Japanese bond yields being up? Because Japanese bond yields have crossed 4% for the first time in decades. For thirty years, Japanese investors had to look abroad for yield. Now they can get it at home. That $1.2 trillion in US Treasuries starts to have a reason to head back to Tokyo. All that cheap Japanese money had to go somewhere. For thirty years, it went into Treasuries, tech stocks, everything. Now imagine it leaving. And that has markets on edge. **What's next?** I don't know how this shakes out. But when Ray Dalio talks about a \"changing world order,\" this is probably part of it. One of the global market's laws of nature, endless cheap Japanese money, is coming to an end. **Note:** I wrote this as an exercise to help myself understand the situation. By no means an expert, so let me know if I missed anything obvious.",

      "selftext_processed": "The 30year backstory Japans economy melted down in 1990 with the popping of a huge real estate and equity bubble . To restore the economy Japan pioneered the playbook central banks now run everywhere slash interest rates to zero then buy massive quantities of your own government bonds . This creates artificial demand that pushes yields aka borrowing costs even lower . Its a bit like your left pocket owing money to your right pocket . And being able to print money to pay it back . It let Japan run up the largest debt in the world . 1.3 quadrillion yen to be exact . Thats quadrillion with a Q . It also opened up an obvious trade . If you can borrow money for free and put it in something yielding 4 5 6 % ... youve found an infinite money glitch . Japanese investors plowed into US treasury bills . This made them the largest holder of US treasuries with $ 1.2 trillion . The rest went into tech stocks and anything else going up . This worked great for thirty years until COVID . Governments were forced to print money en masse and inflation finally arrived . Japans playbook worked when inflation was dead . But when it finally came back and prices started rising printing money would make it worse . So Japan has had to stop printing money and raise rates . The $ 1.2 trillion dollar question So the reason people are freaking out about Japanese bond yields being up Because Japanese bond yields have crossed 4 % for the first time in decades . For thirty years Japanese investors had to look abroad for yield . Now they can get it at home . That $ 1.2 trillion in US Treasuries starts to have a reason to head back to Tokyo . All that cheap Japanese money had to go somewhere . For thirty years it went into Treasuries tech stocks everything . Now imagine it leaving . And that has markets on edge . Whats next I dont know how this shakes out . But when Ray Dalio talks about a changing world order this is probably part of it . One of the global markets laws of nature endless cheap Japanese money is coming to an end . Note I wrote this as an exercise to help myself understand the situation . By no_means an expert so let me know if I missed anything obvious ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ ]( >The European Union's legislative body on Wednesday halted work on the formal approval and implementation of the trade deal it reached last summer with President Donald Trump. >\"Given the continued and escalating threats, including tariff threats, against Greenland and Denmark, and their European allies, we have been left with no alternative but to suspend work\" on the deal, said Bernd Lange, the chairman of the European Parliament's international trade committee. >\"Until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation,\" no steps to move the deal forward would be taken, Lange said in a statement. >\"Our sovereignty and territorial integrity are at stake,\" he added in a post on X. \"Business as usual impossible.\" >The announcement came after Trump on Saturday said he would hit seven European Union countries, plus the U.K., with tariffs if they did not allow the United States to control Greenland. >The E.U. trade deal was reached in July during a visit by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Trump's golf club in Turnberry, Scotland. >The core of the deal was a cap on U.S. tariffs applied to most imports from the E.U. at just 15%. The rate was among the lowest received by any trading partner last year. >Some imports from the E.U., such as generic pharmaceuticals would have had all tariffs removed. >In exchange for the lower tariff rate, the European Union, America's largest trading partner, would have lowered tariffs on some goods it imports from the United States. This would have helped American agricultural and industrial companies sell products into the 27-country bloc. >The total trading relationship between the U.S. and E.U. was worth $1.5 trillion in goods and services annually, as of 2024. The U.S. imports more than $600 billion in goods from the bloc each year on average, while Europeans buy more than $360 billion of U.S. goods, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative. >When the so-called \"Turnberry deal\" was first announced, the European Commission hailed its potential, saying it \"restores stability and predictability.\" >But all that changed with Trump's Saturday tariff threat. >\"In politics as in business, a deal is a deal\" Von der Leyen said on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"When friends shake hands, it must mean something.\" >During his own Davos speech, Trump said that the U.S. would not use force to seize Greenland. But he did not take his threat of a 10% tariff starting Feb. 1 off the table. >Lange, the E.U. trade official, held a press conference following Trump's speech and called the president's assurances about force in Greenland \"a small positive element.\" >Nonetheless, \"It's totally clear that with this 10%-25% \\[tariffs\\] pressure, he is really getting into a new quality of relation,\" said Lange. >As long as Trump's tariff threat remains in place, \"There will be no possibility for compromise\" Lange said. >On Thursday, leaders of the 27 E.U. countries will meet to discuss their coordinated response to Trump's Greenland threats. >This may include a package of retaliatory tariffs worth nearly $110 billion, which would impact a wide range of U.S. exports, from Boeing airplanes to soybeans to Kentucky bourbon. >Another potential retaliatory measure would be to deploy the bloc's \"Anti-Coercion Instrument,\" a policy option sometimes referred to as the E.U.'s trade \"bazooka.\" >The ACI would allow the European Commission to target nearly any U.S. goods or services in Europe with a wide range of restrictions and barriers. >These could include investment restrictions, the lifting of intellectual property protections for American companies, the suspension of business licenses, and outright bans on market access to the Eurozone. >Originally proposed in 2021 to give the E.U. a powerful set of tools to counter potential Chinese economic coercion, the trade bazooka has never been deployed before. >On Wednesday, Lange said he was in favor of putting the bazooka into use.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source The European Unions legislative body on Wednesday halted work on the formal approval and implementation of the trade deal it reached last summer with President Donald Trump . Given the continued and escalating threats including tariff threats against Greenland and Denmark and their European allies we have been left with no_alternative but to suspend work on the deal said Bernd Lange the chairman of the European Parliaments international trade committee . Until the US decides to reengage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation no_steps to move the deal forward would be taken Lange said in a statement . Our sovereignty and territorial integrity are at stake he added in a post on X . Business as usual impossible . The announcement came after Trump on Saturday said he would hit seven European Union countries plus the U.K. with tariffs if they did not_allow the United States to control Greenland . The E.U . trade deal was reached in July during a visit by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Trumps golf club in Turnberry Scotland . The core of the deal was a cap on U.S. tariffs applied to most imports from the E.U . at just 15 % . The rate was among the lowest received by any trading partner last year . Some imports from the E.U . such as generic pharmaceuticals would have had all tariffs removed . In exchange for the lower tariff rate the European Union Americas largest trading partner would have lowered tariffs on some goods it imports from the United States . This would have helped American agricultural and industrial companies sell products into the 27country bloc . The total trading relationship between the U.S. and E.U . was worth $ 1.5 trillion in goods and services annually as of 2024 . The U.S. imports more than $ 600 billion in goods from the bloc each year on average while Europeans buy more than $ 360 billion of U.S. goods according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative . When the socalled Turnberry deal was first announced the European Commission hailed its potential saying it restores stability and predictability . But all that changed with Trumps Saturday tariff threat . In politics as in business a deal is a deal Von der Leyen said on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland . When friends shake hands it must mean something . During his own Davos speech Trump said that the U.S. would not_use force to seize Greenland . But he did not_take his threat of a 10 % tariff starting Feb. 1 off the table . Lange the E.U . trade official held a press conference following Trumps speech and called the presidents assurances about force in Greenland a small positive element . Nonetheless Its totally clear that with this 10 % 25 % tariffs pressure he is really getting into a new quality of relation said Lange . As long as Trumps tariff threat remains in place There will be no_possibility for compromise Lange said . On Thursday leaders of the 27 E.U . countries will meet to discuss their coordinated response to Trumps Greenland threats . This may include a package of retaliatory tariffs worth nearly $ 110 billion which would impact a wide range of U.S. exports from Boeing airplanes to soybeans to Kentucky bourbon . Another potential retaliatory measure would be to deploy the blocs AntiCoercion Instrument a policy option sometimes referred to as the E.U.s trade bazooka . The ACI would allow the European Commission to target nearly any U.S. goods or services in Europe with a wide range of restrictions and barriers . These could include investment restrictions the lifting of intellectual property protections for American companies the suspension of business licenses and outright bans on market access to the Eurozone . Originally proposed in 2021 to give the E.U . a powerful set of tools to counter potential Chinese economic coercion the trade bazooka has never_been deployed before . On Wednesday Lange said he was in favor of putting the bazooka into use ."

      "selftext": "European lawmakers on Wednesday suspended the approval of the trade deal that the EU and U.S. agreed in July. In a statement on Wednesday, European Parliament member Bernd Lange, and INTA chair on EU-US trade relations, said the recent plans by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs of between 10% to 25% on European nations go against the terms of the trade pact. Referring to Trump’s address at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Lange said: “I guess he didn’t revise his position. He wants to have Greenland as part of the United States as quick as possible.” In his speech, the president called for “immediate negotiations” on the acquisition of the Arctic territory. Trump ruled out the use of military force in his speech, a commitment Lange described as a “small positive element.” However, Lange said the proposed 10% to 25% tariffs remain on the table, adding that, until the threat of them is over, “there will be no possibility of compromise.” “We will hold on the procedure... until there is clarity regarding Greenland and the threats,” he said. Lange said Trump is “using tariffs as an instrument of political pressure” as a way to buy Greenland, and described the move as “an attack against the economic and territorial sovereignty of the European Union.” Politics aside, this is good for Equities market all around. Expect markets to be ticking higher until end of earnings season.",

In a statement on Wednesday European Parliament member Bernd Lange and INTA chair on EUUS trade relations said the recent plans by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs of between 10 % to 25 % on European nations go against the terms of the trade pact . Referring to Trump ’ s address at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday Lange said “ I guess he didn ’ t revise his position . He wants to have Greenland as part of the United States as quick as possible. ” In his speech the president called for “ immediate negotiations ” on the acquisition of the Arctic territory . Trump ruled out the use of military force in his speech a commitment Lange described as a “ small positive element. ” However Lange said the proposed 10 % to 25 % tariffs remain on the table adding that until the threat of them is over “ there will be no_possibility of compromise. ” “ We will hold on the procedure ... until there is clarity regarding Greenland and the threats ” he said . Lange said Trump is “ using tariffs as an instrument of political pressure ” as a way to buy Greenland and described the move as “ an attack against the economic and territorial sovereignty of the European Union. ” Politics aside this is good for Equities market all around . Expect markets to be ticking higher until end of earnings season ."

The worst one so far for me has been with IBRX as I bought it yesterday as it was rising, making my average price of 7.11$. I realized my mistake too late after seeing the prices drop down to 6.5$ and at that point I just couldn't accept the loss so I didn't sell. In order to break out of this \"buy high sell low\" pattern, how should I approach buying a stock or an ETF? I know the general advice is to \"buy the dip\" but stocks, at least to me, seem to rarely drop considerably to be considered a dip. How do you approach buying or selling a stock?

      "selftext": "I keep hearing people compare Nvidia to Cisco Systems circa 1999. Bulls say Nvidia is different. Bears say it's the dot-com bubble all over again. I own 190 shares and here's my honest assessment. First, the bull case. Nvidia's real moat isn't just GPUs. It's CUDA. 4.5M developers vs 1.8M in 2020. That's an ecosystem Cisco never had. Cisco laid 'dark fiber', infrastructure nobody used. Nvidia's GPUs are powering real products generating real revenue. There are already 10 AI products over $1B ARR, 50 over $100M. Enterprise AI spending is $37B in 2025, up from $11.5B in 2024. That's 3x growth. The demand is real, not hypothetical as it was for Cisco. But the bear case is legitimate. At 50x P/E, Nvidia is priced for perfection. If hyperscaler capex peaks or competition emerges, the stock has a long way to fall. Google's TPU, Amazon's Trainium, Microsoft's Maia - all custom chips designed to reduce Nvidia dependence. If any succeed at scale, Nvidia's moat gets tested (although these are arguably a long way off). The wildcard is export controls. As a lawyer and former compliance officer at a big bank, I see something most overlook - the US govt plans to take 25% of Nvidia's China chip sales. They've literally crowned Nvidia as the winner. This creates a regulatory moat. The government has skin in the game. But it's also a risk because China has to play along (which they soon likely will) and policy could change overnight. But here's the valuation reality - Nvidia needs \\~$198B earnings by 2028 to justify current prices. In my newsletter, I break down various scenarios: Bull case (25%): doubles from here. Base case (50%): down \\~15%. Bear case (25%): down \\~65%.",

      "selftext_processed": "I keep hearing people compare Nvidia to Cisco Systems circa 1999 . Bulls say Nvidia is different . Bears say its the dotcom bubble all over again . I own 190 shares and heres my honest assessment . First the bull case . Nvidias real moat isnt just GPUs . Its CUDA . 4.5M developers vs 1.8M in 2020 . Thats an ecosystem Cisco never_had . Cisco laid dark fiber infrastructure nobody_used . Nvidias GPUs are powering real products generating real revenue . There are already 10 AI products over $ 1B ARR 50 over $ 100M . Enterprise AI spending is $ 37B in 2025 up from $ 11.5B in 2024 . Thats 3x growth . The demand is real not_hypothetical as it was for Cisco . But the bear case is legitimate . At 50x PE Nvidia is priced for perfection . If hyperscaler capex peaks or competition emerges the stock has a long way to fall . Googles TPU Amazons Trainium Microsofts Maia all custom chips designed to reduce Nvidia dependence . If any succeed at scale Nvidias moat gets tested although these are arguably a long way off . The wildcard is export controls . As a lawyer and former compliance officer at a big bank I see something most overlook the US govt plans to take 25 % of Nvidias China chip sales . Theyve literally crowned Nvidia as the winner . This creates a regulatory moat . The government has skin in the game . But its also a risk because China has to play along which they soon likely will and policy could change overnight . But heres the valuation reality Nvidia needs $ 198B earnings by 2028 to justify current prices . In my newsletter I break down various scenarios Bull case 25 % doubles from here . Base case 50 % down 15 % . Bear case 25 % down 65 % ."

      "selftext": "So I've been watching Atlassian (**$TEAM**) stock for a while now and have personally decided to pull the trigger. If you don't know Atlassian, they're a software company who create productivity software and are massively used in the tech industry and in most companies that use Agile processes. Put it this way, I work in tech and the majority of companies I have worked in use Atlassian products, namely Confluence, Jira, Service desk and such. Also before anyone mentions it, the profitability of Atlassian is hidden because of SBC but this hasn't been a problem for the market in the past 5+ years. Plus they invest 30% in R&D! It has pulled back over 50% in the past year from its 52 week high of $326. The main reasoning for this is the insider selling, but this is just 10b5-1 plans which is expected... To counter this they currently have a $2.5b share buy back issued and I suspect they'll have more to come at these low prices. The other main reason is the AI fear. Why I think the stock will rise a lot from here: * AI replacing engineers is overhyped, so imo we won't be seeing less sales coming from this. If anything I think over the long term it will increase as more software products are desired and a bunch of mess from AI has to be cleaned up by real developers * AI being able to produce a product like Jira is even more overhyped/crazy. Its great for boilerplate code and basic apps if you know what you're doing, but thinking you can create a scalable, secure, production ready application set like what Atlassian has with all of the regulatory compliance and such built in is crazy... * Deeply embedded in many companies - as I mentioned whether you like Confluence/Jira or not it is used in so many companies and won't be going anywhere * The move away from self hosted to cloud based subscriptions is going to create even more revenue growth as the adoption continues * Rovo their AI tool that will be integrated in the Atlassian eco system will add even more value once further adoption occurs * Recent acquisitions will add further revenue Summary: TEAM often trades at massive multiples (25x-40x Sales). Today, trading around **4.7x** **EV/Sales** with a deeply entrenched moat embedded within thousands of large companies, 20%+ growth, and massive Free Cash Flow (FCF) margins. Currently sitting at a multi year support level ready for its next explosive recovery and new all time high in the next 6-24 months. Let me know what you think! Is the overhyped AI fear SaaS sell-off over?",

      "selftext_processed": "So Ive been watching Atlassian $ TEAM stock for a while now and have personally decided to pull the trigger . If you dont know Atlassian theyre a software company who create productivity software and are massively used in the tech industry and in most companies that use Agile processes . Put it this way I work in tech and the majority of companies I have worked in use Atlassian products namely Confluence Jira Service desk and such . Also before anyone mentions it the profitability of Atlassian is hidden because of SBC but this hasnt been a problem for the market in the past 5 years . Plus they invest 30 % in RD It has pulled back over 50 % in the past year from its 52 week high of $ 326 . The main reasoning for this is the insider selling but this is just 10b51 plans which is expected ... To counter this they currently have a $ 2.5b share buy back issued and I suspect theyll have more to come at these low prices . The other main reason is the AI fear . Why I think the stock will rise a lot from here AI replacing engineers is overhyped so imo we wont be seeing less sales coming from this . If anything I think over the long term it will increase as more software products are desired and a bunch of mess from AI has to be cleaned up by real developers AI being able to produce a product like Jira is even more overhypedcrazy . Its great for boilerplate code and basic apps if you know what youre doing but thinking you can create a scalable secure production ready application set like what Atlassian has with all of the regulatory compliance and such built in is crazy ... Deeply embedded in many companies as I mentioned whether you like ConfluenceJira or not_it is used in so many companies and wont be going anywhere The move away from self hosted to cloud based subscriptions is going to create even more revenue growth as the adoption continues Rovo their AI tool that will be integrated in the Atlassian eco system will add even more value once further adoption occurs Recent acquisitions will add further revenue Summary TEAM often trades at massive multiples 25x40x Sales . Today trading around 4.7x EVSales with a deeply entrenched moat embedded within thousands of large companies 20 % growth and massive Free Cash Flow FCF margins . Currently sitting at a multi year support level ready for its next explosive recovery and new all time high in the next 624 months . Let me know what you think Is the overhyped AI fear SaaS selloff over"

      "selftext": "President Trump said the U.S. wouldn't use force to acquire Greenland and was seeking negotiations on the acquisition of the territory, repeating his claim that only the U.S. is capable of defending it. In an address in Davos, Switzerland, he said the reason the U.S. needs to take control of Greenland is purely for security and has nothing to do with access to minerals. He opened his speech by saying Europe wasn't heading in the right direction, adding that “certain places in Europe are not recognizable” and criticizing the region's approach to energy. He also touted the successes of the U.S. economy, saying it was in the midst of the “most dramatic economic turnaround in history.” The speech came on the back of raised tensions between the U.S. and Europe over the president's designs on Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, with terse exchanges between officials at the Swiss gathering.

However, everywhere I read that investing in Chinese stocks carries political risk and that American stocks are safer. Why is that? Don't you think it is because most websites about investing are American and they do not encourage to invest in China? I find for example Tencent Holdings an interesting company to invest in. What is your opinion on this?",

However everywhere I read that investing in Chinese stocks carries political risk and that American stocks are safer . Why is that Dont you think it is because most websites about investing are American and they do not_encourage to invest in China I find for example Tencent Holdings an interesting company to invest in . What is your opinion on this"

      "selftext": "Many of you know this but in the last century, money changed three times: 1. 1933-1934 During the Great Depression, the US government banned the ownership of gold. Citizens were required by law to turn in their gold for dollars at $20.67 per ounce. Shortly after people turned in their gold, the US government revalued gold at 35$ per ounce, effectively devaluing the dollar overnight. 2. 1944-1971 After World War II, a new system was created: the Bretton Woods system. The US dollar became the world's reserve currency, convertible to gold at $35 per ounce for foreign governments & central banks. Most global trade and reserves were held in dollars, while gold was stored in US government vaults. This system worked until foreign claims on US gold exceeded available reserves. 3. 1971 The US ended gold convertibility entirely. Money was backed by trust, institutions and policy. Under the gold standard and Bretton Woods, the Federal Reserve’s ability to expand the money supply was constrained by gold convertibility. After Bretton Woods ended in 1971, those constraints disappeared, giving the Fed far greater discretion to create liquidity Most of the US gold reserve (8 metric tons of gold) was accumulated before 1971, first through domestic gold confiscation in the 1930s and later through foreign gold inflows under the Bretton Woods system as dollars were exchanged for gold. The same \\~8,000 tons of US gold were valued at \\~$5B in 1933, \\~$9B after the 1934 revaluation, and would be worth over $1.25T today at market prices. This lead to assets going up in value drastically. \\- Today gold is valued at $4,880 per ounce. That means the dollar has lost it's value 233 times to gold since the 1930s. \\- Equities performed very well, despite early volatility. The S&P 500 rose from 90 in the early 1970s to almost hitting 7,000 recently (trading around 6,800 as I am writing this). \\- Real Estate compounded strongly. The Average Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States (ASPUS - a statistic from FRED) went from $19,300 in 1963 to $512,800 in Q2 of 2025. \\- Silver oscillated between monetary and industrial roles, rising from roughly $1.50/oz in the early 1970s to \\~$95/oz today. \\- Oil repriced meaningfully going from 3$ per barrel in the early 70s to \\~60$ per barrel. Early stock markets were far more volatile than today. During the Great Depression equities fell nearly 90%. Over time, owning productive businesses proved resilient not because volatility disappeared, but because companies could adapt and reprice under new monetary rules. Gold followed a similar path, from money to restricted asset, to restricted reserve and finally a long-term hedge against currency debasement. Today, digital assets exist alongside the traditional assets mentioned above and they appear to be at an earlier stage of that same maturation process. Bitcoin introduced a globally transferable asset with a hard capped supply. Whether this asset ultimately becomes a long term store of value, settlement infrastructure or simply another category of risk asset is still uncertain. How do you think monetary policy will evolve? Do you think digital assets have a part in this evolution?",

      "selftext_processed": "Many of you know this but in the last century money changed three times 1 . 19331934 During the Great Depression the US government banned the ownership of gold . Citizens were required by law to turn in their gold for dollars at $ 20.67 per ounce . Shortly after people turned in their gold the US government revalued gold at 35 $ per ounce effectively devaluing the dollar overnight . 2 . 19441971 After World War II a new system was created the Bretton Woods system . The US dollar became the worlds reserve currency convertible to gold at $ 35 per ounce for foreign governments central banks . Most global trade and reserves were held in dollars while gold was stored in US government vaults . This system worked until foreign claims on US gold exceeded available reserves . 3 . 1971 The US ended gold convertibility entirely . Money was backed by trust institutions and policy . Under the gold standard and Bretton Woods the Federal Reserve ’ s ability to expand the money supply was constrained by gold convertibility . After Bretton Woods ended in 1971 those constraints disappeared giving the Fed far greater discretion to create liquidity Most of the US gold reserve 8 metric tons of gold was accumulated before 1971 first through domestic gold confiscation in the 1930s and later through foreign gold inflows under the Bretton Woods system as dollars were exchanged for gold . The same 8000 tons of US gold were valued at $ 5B in 1933 $ 9B after the 1934 revaluation and would be worth over $ 1.25T today at market prices . This lead to assets going up in value drastically . Today gold is valued at $ 4880 per ounce . That means the dollar has lost its value 233 times to gold since the 1930s . Equities performed very well despite early volatility . The SP 500 rose from 90 in the early 1970s to almost hitting 7000 recently trading around 6800 as I am writing this . Real Estate compounded strongly . The Average Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States ASPUS a statistic from FRED went from $ 19300 in 1963 to $ 512800 in Q2 of 2025 . Silver oscillated between monetary and industrial roles rising from roughly $ 1.50oz in the early 1970s to $ 95oz today . Oil repriced meaningfully going from 3 $ per barrel in the early 70s to 60 $ per barrel . Early stock markets were far more volatile than today . During the Great Depression equities fell nearly 90 % . Over time owning productive businesses proved resilient not_because volatility disappeared but because companies could adapt and reprice under new monetary rules . Gold followed a similar path from money to restricted asset to restricted reserve and finally a longterm hedge against currency debasement . Today digital assets exist alongside the traditional assets mentioned above and they appear to be at an earlier stage of that same maturation process . Bitcoin introduced a globally transferable asset with a hard capped supply . Whether this asset ultimately becomes a long term store of value settlement infrastructure or simply another category of risk asset is still uncertain . How do you think monetary policy will evolve Do you think digital assets have a part in this evolution"

      "selftext": "Looking at the cross-asset snapshot (SPY/QQQ down \\~2%, ARKK down more, BTC/ETH weak, long yields still elevated, and gold up hard), the message doesn’t feel like a clean “growth scare” or a clean “inflation scare.” It reads more like: the constraint is financing, and the adjustment is getting pushed into the places that can move fastest (risk premia, multiples, labor). A useful way to frame it is: stop asking “soft landing or recession?” and ask “where does the system externalize adjustment: prices, profits, or people?” In a slowdown with high fixed costs and still-meaningful financing rates, companies tend to defend mrgns first. This often means labor becomes the shock absorber (hiring slows, layoffs, wage pressure), while capex gets more selective, concentrated into productivity tech and “bottleneck control, not broad expansion. The non-obvious link here is the long end. When long yields stay firm while equities sell off, that’s not the market offering relief. It’s tightening the hurdle rate. That’s also why gold ripping while the long end doesn’t fall is interesting: it can be less “inflation hedge” and more “trust hedge/regime hedge.” This is the kind of tape where liquidity is selective, some things find bids, a lot of things don’t. **Quick asset paths (just how I’d map scenarios):** Gold: can keep working if stress is about confidence/term premium, even if stocks are weak. If yields actually roll over cleanly, gold can go sideways while risk re-rates. BTC: tends to trade like liquidity sensitivity + reflexivity. If the funding constraint persists, BTC can stay heavy; if policy/liquidity engineering shows up, it can move violently. ETH: usually higher beta than BTC, often needs “easy conditions” more. Watch ETH/BTC for whether liquidty is broadening. Tech companies like AMD/NVDA: caught between AI capex resilience and rate sensitivity (duration). If yields stabilize/fall, multiples can re-rate fast; if term premium stays sticky, “good company, bad tape” can persist. If this is the right read, “solutions” probably don’t look like a simple Fed cut story. More likely it’s a mix of liquidity plumbing, debt management, and,or implicit yield management when volatility becomes unacceptable. The trade-off is you don’t get a stable “everything rallies” regime, you get dispersion and capital concentrating in whoever can fund themselves cheaply and control bottlenecks.",

If yields actually roll over cleanly gold can go sideways while risk rerates . BTC tends to trade like liquidity sensitivity reflexivity . If the funding constraint persists BTC can stay heavy if policyliquidity engineering shows up it can move violently . ETH usually higher beta than BTC often needs “ easy conditions ” more . Watch ETHBTC for whether liquidty is broadening . Tech companies like AMDNVDA caught between AI capex resilience and rate sensitivity duration . If yields stabilizefall multiples can rerate fast if term premium stays sticky “ good company bad tape ” can persist . If this is the right read “ solutions ” probably don ’ t look like a simple Fed cut story . More likely it ’ s a mix of liquidity plumbing debt management andor implicit yield management when volatility becomes unacceptable . The tradeoff is you don ’ t get a stable “ everything rallies ” regime you get dispersion and capital concentrating in whoever can fund themselves cheaply and control bottlenecks ."

Following recent news, and recent Trump administraion 'tendencies', I dont have a feeling of investing in the US anymore. The US find and have showed that they have unmatched power, they can do what they want. But without the rest of the world, being isolated, that power will be no more than just a bluff. I find it is the time to sell all my US stocks, leave the damn market, put that money into Europe, where there are still lots of great companies. I would like to hear opinions from Americans and Europeans as well. Edit: thank you guys for sharing the thoughts. Somebody judged that my thought is childish and emotional. Well, yes and no. It is not only that I am unhappy or mad at Trump and his fellows, it is more about showing to the US the resistance once they have stepped too far. Me alone is just a grain of sand, but with the many of Europeans or else where, it will not be an insignificant negative impact on the US market (which Trump cares very much). So hopefully, he realizes a borderline. But well, I am cashing out quite some portion of the US part, not completely yet. Hope to see a better US, with more respect from both directions.",

Following recent news and recent Trump administraion tendencies I dont have a feeling of investing in the US anymore . The US find and have showed that they have unmatched power they can do what they want . But without the rest of the world being isolated that power will be no_more than just a bluff . I find it is the time to sell all my US stocks leave the damn market put that money into Europe where there are still lots of great companies . I would like to hear opinions from Americans and Europeans as well . Edit thank you guys for sharing the thoughts . Somebody judged that my thought is childish and emotional . Well yes and no_It is not_only that I am unhappy or mad at Trump and his fellows it is more about showing to the US the resistance once they have stepped too far . Me alone is just a grain of sand but with the many of Europeans or else where it will not_be an insignificant negative impact on the US market which Trump cares very much . So hopefully he realizes a borderline . But well I am cashing out quite some portion of the US part not_completely yet . Hope to see a better US with more respect from both directions ."

This year, some people have asked a great question: Why is the Trump administration going to Davos at all? Why show up and participate when we’ve been so clear that the old globalist line of thinking has been a disaster for America? >The answer is simple: we’re not going to Davos to uphold the status quo. We’re going to confront it head-on. >For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world. Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary, borders were not, and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good. That approach failed the US, crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well. It destroyed industries, weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind. ... >We are here at Davos to make one thing crystal clear: With President Trump, capitalism has a new sheriff in town. For decades, countries were told there was only one acceptable model. They were forced to depend on global supply chains and foolishly trust that global institutions would have their backs. That model put America dead last, and left countless others weaker as well. There's other crazy stuff in there like taking credit for the uptick in overseas stock markets. No mention of the Greenland/NATO stuff. EDIT: [FT now reporting]( that Lutnick got heckled and jeered at a Davos dinner last night, with some attendees walking out. It's going to be a messy day.",

      "selftext_processed": "Another delusional and unhinged oped in the FT from the Trump admin this time from Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick Every year in January leaders gather in Davos Switzerland for the World Economic Forum to discuss the global economy . This year some people have asked a great question Why is the Trump administration going to Davos at all Why show up and participate when we ’ ve been so clear that the old globalist line of thinking has been a disaster for America The answer is simple we ’ re not_going to Davos to uphold the status quo . We ’ re going to confront it headon . For far too long the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America ’ s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world . Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary borders were not_and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good . That approach failed the US crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well . It destroyed industries weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind . ... We are here at Davos to make one thing crystal clear With President Trump capitalism has a new sheriff in town . For decades countries were told there was only one acceptable model . They were forced to depend on global supply chains and foolishly trust that global institutions would have their backs . That model put America dead last and left countless others weaker as well . Theres other crazy stuff in there like taking credit for the uptick in overseas stock markets . No_mention of the GreenlandNATO stuff . EDIT FT now reporting that Lutnick got heckled and jeered at a Davos dinner last night with some attendees walking out . Its going to be a messy day ."

He brushed off the recent market chaos caused by Trump’s threat to slap 10% to 25% tariffs on several European allies if they don’t help make the deal happen. Even though some international investors started dumping U.S. Treasuries in response, Bessent claimed the idea of a global selloff is just a false narrative.

      "title": "Why Are People So Negative on HIMS? “No Moat” Argument Feels Overblown",
      "selftext": "I’ve been seeing a lot of bearish takes on HIMS lately, and the most common criticism seems to be that the company has no moat and will get crushed by competition. I’m genuinely trying to understand this take because it feels overly simplistic. Yes, telehealth is competitive. Yes, a lot of companies can sell ED meds, hair loss treatments, etc. But HIMS isn’t just standing still or doing the bare minimum. They’re rolling out at-home lab testing, expanding into menopause / perimenopause care, and even getting into peptides. Those are not trivial add-ons. I honestly haven’t seen many competitors offering at-home labs at scale as part of a broader subscription health platform. To me, the moat argument misses a few things: Ecosystem > single product. Someone who does labs + ongoing treatment + subscriptions is way stickier than someone buying generic meds once. Menopause care is massively underserved and growing fast. Peptides and personalized health feel like early innings, not late-stage commoditized stuff. Brand matters more than people admit in healthcare. I get the concerns around: Marketing spend Margins Competition from Ro, Amazon, traditional healthcare, etc. But saying “no moat” feels lazy. Not every moat is patents or exclusive tech — sometimes it’s distribution, trust, brand, and integration. So I’m genuinely curious: Is the negativity mostly about valuation and past stock performance? Do people just lump HIMS in with every other telehealth company? Or is there something structurally broken here that I’m missing? Not trying to pump — just trying to understand why sentiment is so bad when the company seems to be expanding into harder, more defensible areas, not easier ones. Would love to hear real bear cases beyond “competition bad.”",

      "selftext": "Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you might have come across at least 1 news article on the metal industry boom and metal stocks hitting their all-time highs, mainly silver and copper stocks like Vedanta and Hindustan Copper. According to a report by tradebrains these are the reasons for the Metal Stocks Rally • Copper prices at record high: Copper prices jumped to an all-time high of $13,253.50 per tonne on the LME due to fears of supply shortages and rising uncertainty in Venezuela, a key region for natural resources. • Critical minerals theme: According to market experts, metals like copper are gaining importance as countries focus on securing critical minerals and strengthening supply chains in the changing global order. • Impact of US Fed rate cut: The December US Federal Reserve rate cut supported metal prices by improving liquidity and encouraging investment in commodities. • Supply-side concerns: Ongoing worries about tight global supply and the possibility of additional sector-specific tariffs have added to positive sentiment. • Aluminium price rise: Aluminium prices also moved higher, driven by a tighter supply outlook and expectations of strong long-term demand across industries such as infrastructure and energy. In view of these factors, stocks like Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc, Hindustan Copper, Hindalco are witnessing sharp buying interest. Which is your fav stock at the moment?",

      "selftext": "​**Historical Compute Capacity and Revenue Trend (2023–2025)** OpenAI has established a consistent correlation between compute capcity and revenue generation: 1GW compute capacity yields $10B annualised revenue. * ​2023: 0.2 GW capacity and $2B revenue * 2024: 0.6GW capacity and $6B revenue * 2025: $1.9GW capacity and $20B revenue ​CAGR (2023-25): 216% * This expansion was constrained by chip supply and power availability. ------------ **​Revenue Multipliers: Ads and Hardware** ​The revenue:capacity ratio will climb above $10B/GW because of: * Ads: OpenAI will start testing ads in the free and Go tiers in US in the coming weeks. * ​Hardware: Jony Ive’s AI wearable (codenamed Sweetpea) is in development. 40 million units predicted to be released in the first year. ​**2026 to 2030 Compute Capacity Projections** * **2026: 4.4GW** (*= 2.4GW Stargate USA + 0.2GW Stargate UAE + 1GW MSFT Fairwater + 0.6GW Coreweave + 0.2GW Small Modular Reactors*) * **2027: 11GW** (*= 4.3GW Stargate USA + 1GW Stargate UAE + 3.3GW MSFT Fairwater + 1.2GW Coreweave + 1.2GW Small Modular Reactors*) * **2028: 16GW** (*= 5.7GW Stargate USA + 2.5GW Stargate UAE + 4GW MSFT Fairwater + 1.8GW Coreweave + 2GW Small Modular Reactors*) * **2029: 22GW** (*= 6.4GW Stargate USA + 4GW Stargate UAE + 5GW MSFT Fairwater + 2.5GW Coreweave + 4.1GW Small Modular Reactors*) * **2030: 28GW** (*= 7GW Stargate USA + 5GW Stargate UAE + 6GW MSFT Fairwater + 3GW Coreweave + 7GW Small Modular Reactors*) **2026 to 2030 Revenue Projections** ​The subscription revenue will scale with power and the ad tier and hardware will act as high margin multipliers. * **2026: $44B** (*4.4GW*) * ​**2027: $131B** (*$110B (11GW) + $9B (1.2B users x $7.50 annual ad revenue per user) + $12B (40M wearable units x $300 per unit)*) * ​**2028: $193B** (*$160B (16GW) + $18B (1.8B users x $10 annual ad revenue per user) + $15B (60M wearable units x $250 per unit)*) * **2029: $263.5B** (*$220B (22GW) + $27.5B (2.2B users x $12.50 annual ad revenue per user) + $16B (80M wearable units x $200 per unit)*) * ​**2030: $334B** (*$280B (28GW) + $39B (2.6B users x $15 annual ad revenue per user) + $15B (100M wearable units x $150 per unit)*) ​Projected CAGR (2025–2030): 66% **​IPO and Market Cap** ​OpenAI restructured into a for profit benefit corporation in Oct 2025. IPO rumours are for early 2027. * Valuation (Q4 2025): $500B * Forecast Valuation (Additional Private Fundraising in 2026): $750B * ​IPO Market Cap (2027): $1T to $1.5T ​**Risks** * ​Power Ceiling: Grid limitations and permitting delays are key risks. * Capital Burn: OpenAI expects to burn over $115B through 2029 and reach profitability only by 2030. * AI Commoditisation: If competitors (Google or Anthropic) achieve similar intelligence with less compute, OpenAI’s $10B/GW efficiency ratio would collapse under pricing pressure.",

      "selftext": "I want this knowledgeable community to poke holes in my logic. I have stocks that have significant unrealized gains, and I have decent amount of cash. If I invest all the cash in VOO right now (close to ATH) and when market goes down, I sell VOO and buy VTI to maintain same exposure while harvesting tax losses against the significant realized gains *(yes, I will sell the stock with gains but won't have to pay any or as much tax)*. With this approach, I win if market goes up (VOO investment increases) and I win if market goes down (tax benefit). Here's an example - let's say I invested $2k in individual stocks and have $10k unrealized gain in those individual stocks (i.e. total $12k). Additionally, I have $20k cash I invest in VOO and if this $20k becomes $15k, I sell $15k VOO to get $15k VTI and $5k in TLH. Now when I sell the individual stocks, I get $12k and need to pay tax on $5k ($10k realized gain - $5k TLH). As a result, I scan invest $12k cash in individual stocks. What am I missing?",

He's still buying. His only exit is a full takeover which he always aims for in the past 2. **BlackRock's 6M Share Position** — This isn't a passive index fund holding and rumoured to be Evy Hambro UK team. BlackRock actively chose to hold 7.4% of a junior miner exploration on a conviction fund/client account. 3. **Tribeca (7.9%)** — Australian hedge fund specializing in natural resources. They're long-term holders, not day traders. 4. **81.7% Institutional** — Only \\~18% of shares are held by retail. When institutions own this much and none are selling, there's no supply. **The Price Dynamics:** |Factor|Effect| |:-|:-| |Low float (\\~30M shares)|Small buying pressure = big price moves (what we're seeing)| |Sprott adding, not selling|Largest holder is a buyer| |No short-term flippers|Patient, thesis-driven holders| **Why the Stock Doesn't Sell Off:** When a stock rises 13x (from $3.50 to $45), you normally see profit-taking. Not here. Why? * **Sprott's cost basis is \\~$5/share** — He's up 9x and still buying at $33. No exit pressure. * **Institutions bought for the takeover** — They're not selling before the a major is forced to buy # Part 6: The Risks |Risk|Mitigation| |:-|:-| |MRE disappoints|Eric's buying pattern suggests otherwise| |Metallurgical issues|Nov 2025 study showed 93% Ag recovery + potential roasting feasibility| |Commodity price drop|Silver has structural deficit (5 years)| |Execution risk|Diane has track record (built Romarco)| |Dilution|Higher stock = less dilution needed| # Part 7: Price Targets |Scenario|Share Price|Multiple from $45| |:-|:-|:-| |MRE Disappointment|$30-35|\\-20% to -30%| |MRE Meets Expectations|$70-90|1.5-2x| |MRE Beats Expectations|$100-130|2-3x| |Takeout (2026-2027)|$130-175|3-4x| # Positions \\-11k in shares, 50 in Feb 25$ calls, 45 in May 30$ calls Up: \\~+300k USD (Positions in SGD) [SGD - USD - SGD](",

His only exit is a full takeover which he always aims for in the past 2 . BlackRocks 6M Share Position — This isnt a passive index fund holding and rumoured to be Evy Hambro UK team . BlackRock actively chose to hold 7.4 % of a junior miner exploration on a conviction fundclient account . 3 . Tribeca 7.9 % — Australian hedge fund specializing in natural resources . Theyre longterm holders not_day traders . 4 . 81.7 % Institutional — Only 18 % of shares are held by retail . When institutions own this much and none are selling theres no_supply .

      "selftext": "I know most people on this subreddit are American and will continue to buy and hold US stocks no matter what. But I live outside the US and am not a US citizen. I'm in my late 20s and have been investing quite heavily in the stock market for the past 5 years. Around half of my portfolio is VOO, and the other half is made up of individual stocks, most of which are American companies like Nvidia, Google and AMD. I also own non-US stocks like BABA, BYD, LULU and a couple others, but those are a relatively small portion of my portfolio atm. I've made some decent returns, but lately, with all the crazy political stuff happening in the US, I don't really have confidence that America is a safe country to invest in anymore (please keep in mind that I'm not American so I have nothing tying me to the US). I think America is speedrunning its own collapse and doing everything it can to destroy decades worth of alliances and soft power. At any moment, Trump could decide to invade Greenland and all my US shares would freefall overnight, with no guarantee on how long it would take to recover. Even from a moral perspective, not even looking at profits, it doesn't feel right investing in US companies when the US is doing so much harm globally at the moment. All this is leading me to seriously considering selling all my US stocks and reallocating them towards either individual non-US stocks, or just investing in an ETF like VXUS. Would this be a smart decision given the fact that I'm not American and am more pessimistic than optimistic about the future of the US's role on the world stage? If not, what else can I do to minimize my risk as a foreign investor?",

      "selftext": "Sold 31 $25 2/20 $AXTI Cash Secured Puts (\\~31DTE). Why? Desperation. On December 1st, I moved apartments because my side and upstairs neighbors would alternate blasting music in the middle of the night. The leasing office and security did Jack shit. I was a pussy and didn't call the cops. So I just moved. Well here's the problem, in the beginning of January, someone moved into the upstairs unit in my new place, and is stomping and jumping on the floor. I tried talking to them, but that caused them to stomp even harder and jump. Ok, not a problem, I can deal with this. except, now they do it in the middle of the night. I don't think they have a job, because I hear this at 1am and 9am alike. I spoke with the leasing office, and get this, the ceilings on the 1st floor units are thinner. when first I moved in, they phrased it as \"The first floor units have extra tall ceilings!\" 😭 Anyway, if AXTI is more than $25 on Feb 20th, then the 18.6k in premium would more than cover breaking my current lease, moving into a new apartment complex (ON THE TOP FLOOR THIS TIME), a new phone for my mom, and the Valve Steam frame for my homie who helped me though all this. oh and taxes of course. You might think this is stupid, and yes, it is, but I've been spiraling these past 6 months. The lack of sleep and constant headache in my old apartment did a number on my mental health. Then, management at my job was going to layoff my entire department, but turns out the new company that was to replace us, didn't have product knowledge. So, a few coworkers and I escaped the layoffs for now. And now, this new apartment upstairs neighbor situation is draining me. I was 170lb in September, I'm now 155lb from all this stress.",

I was a pussy and didnt call the cops . So I just moved . Well heres the problem in the beginning of January someone moved into the upstairs unit in my new place and is stomping and jumping on the floor . I tried talking to them but that caused them to stomp even harder and jump . Ok not_a problem I can deal with this . except now they do it in the middle of the night .

I've been researching Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund it's up 33.72% Calendar YTD 2025 and International Equity Index Fund up 31.83 Calendar YTD 2025. I would like to rebalance my portfolio. I was thinking of rebalancing so that EM at 5% and International Equity Index Fund at 5% as well. Is this a good/bad idea? I would appreciate any insight. I started investing in my late 30s and I'm ok with high risk. I'm aware that for several years prior to the last year or two EM wasn't doing as well and I will be watching that more closely as well. For my personal ROTH IRA my investments are FSKAX 92.09% and FZILX 7.91% of my portfolio. I'm not sure if there is much overlap between all my investments in general. For reference, I'm 44 and plan on working until maybe 67-70 yrs old.",

      "selftext": "REPOST my fault Netflix is an absolute steal right now. NFLX is currently down 30+% over the last 3 months, and is currently looking to be down another 5% after the long weekend. NFLX has long been a consistent hold for investors that don’t look at this sub for its consistent growth throughout the years, but this year and coming NFLX could very well have EXPLOSIVE growth. First things first, NFLX is a very well ran and consistently growing company, with share price still going down right now despite surpassing expectations in their recent report. I don’t need to go into specifics about how good Netflix as a company is. I just want to talk the politics. The big money maker? WBS The deal is happening. It’s very clear the deal is happening. WBS wants it, NFLX wants it, the only thing potentially stopping it is Trump, which I don’t see happening. Once this deal goes through, Netflix will have the monopoly. While every other entertainment company (YouTube, Insta, FB, TikTok, etc.) focus on short form entertainment. The movie industry will essentially be entirely owned by Netflix, going all the way to production, not just rights to stream the movie. Netflix is just going to get bigger, and before this deal goes through is the absolute best price for NFLX shares you will ever see again. Depending on when the deal goes through, I could potentially see NFLX rising 50% this year alone, and could see NFLX reaching 200 within 3 years. I’m putting most of my portfolio into Netflix, keeping in MU until 400, and another decent amount in UUUU and POET Note: Netflix is a pretty volatile stock short term. Stranger things finale sucked ass = Lower Stock. I could potentially see it going as low as 75, but over the next year-2 NFLX will see explosive growth. Thoughts?",

      "selftext_processed": "REPOST my fault Netflix is an absolute steal right now . NFLX is currently down 30 % over the last 3 months and is currently looking to be down another 5 % after the long weekend . NFLX has long been a consistent hold for investors that don ’ t look at this sub for its consistent growth throughout the years but this year and coming NFLX could very well have EXPLOSIVE growth . First things first NFLX is a very well ran and consistently growing company with share price still going down right now despite surpassing expectations in their recent report . I don ’ t need to go into specifics about how good Netflix as a company is . I just want to talk the politics . The big money maker WBS The deal is happening . It ’ s very clear the deal is happening . WBS wants it NFLX wants it the only thing potentially stopping it is Trump which I don ’ t see happening . Once this deal goes through Netflix will have the monopoly . While every other entertainment company YouTube Insta FB TikTok etc . focus on short form entertainment . The movie industry will essentially be entirely owned by Netflix going all the way to production not_just rights to stream the movie . Netflix is just going to get bigger and before this deal goes through is the absolute best price for NFLX shares you will ever see again . Depending on when the deal goes through I could potentially see NFLX rising 50 % this year alone and could see NFLX reaching 200 within 3 years . I ’ m putting most of my portfolio into Netflix keeping in MU until 400 and another decent amount in UUUU and POET Note Netflix is a pretty volatile stock short term . Stranger things finale sucked ass Lower Stock . I could potentially see it going as low as 75 but over the next year2 NFLX will see explosive growth . Thoughts"

Teams are remote devs, designers, PMs all in the same file at the same time and that alone breaks the old Adobe model. Adobe is still basically selling fancy single player software with files you pass around The real threat is that Figma becomes the default layer where product decisions happen not just pixels. Once you start design there you never really need to leave and new designers learn Figma first not Photoshop or Illustrator. That pipeline shift matters way more than people think Adobe has distribution and legacy sure but that can flip into a liability fast. Enterprises move slow individuals dont and Figma already owns the individual mindshare. By the time Adobe ships a real cloud native answer Figma will already be the system of record.. 85% gross margin with revenue growing at 38%; P/S 14; No debt, liquidity fine... I like the stock",

Teams are remote devs designers PMs all in the same file at the same time and that alone breaks the old Adobe model . Adobe is still basically selling fancy single player software with files you pass around The real threat is that Figma becomes the default layer where product decisions happen not_just pixels . Once you start design there you never_really need to leave and new designers learn Figma first not_Photoshop or Illustrator . That pipeline shift matters way more than people think Adobe has distribution and legacy sure but that can flip into a liability fast . Enterprises move slow individuals dont and Figma already owns the individual mindshare . By the time Adobe ships a real cloud native answer Figma will already be the system of record .. 85 % gross margin with revenue growing at 38 % PS 14 No_debt liquidity fine ... I like the stock"

I'm *thinking* it should be fine, since I can't see the advantage in micromanaging lots for tax efficiency when my cap gains taxes are going to be almost zero (for now and the foreseeable future, I'm a very low spender). Searching around I read a lot of comments that weren't in favor of Average Cost, but it seemed like the context was higher-spending individuals concerned about tax efficiency. But I still thought I'd ask for a sanity check on whether I'm missing some major problems. Thanks.",

Is there any reason I should be concerned that I went with Average Cost when I did my first ever stock sale Im thinking it should be fine since I cant see the advantage in micromanaging lots for tax efficiency when my cap gains taxes are going to be almost zero for now and the foreseeable future Im a very low spender . Searching around I read a lot of comments that werent in favor of Average Cost but it seemed like the context was higherspending individuals concerned about tax efficiency . But I still thought Id ask for a sanity check on whether Im missing some major problems . Thanks ."

      "selftext": "I’m doing some research on this stock, seems like it could be a moonshot or burnout stock. What y’all say? ImmunityBio (NASDAQ: IBRX) is a small/mid-cap biotech focused on cancer immunotherapy. It just received FDA-approval for a bladder cancer drug ANKTIVA. ImmunityBio is trying to train/boost the immune system (especially NK cells + T cells) to fight cancer more effectively and for longer duration. Their flagship product is ANKTIVA (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln), an IL-15 receptor agonist designed to activate immune cells. FDA progress ImmunityBio announced a Type B End-of-Phase meeting with the FDA regarding its supplemental Biologics License Application for ANKTIVA plus Bacillus Calmette–Guérin in BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The FDA requested additional information but did not require new clinical trials. ImmunityBio plans to submit the requested data within 30 days, supporting a potential resubmission without further trials. This reduces regulatory uncertainty and supports the stock’s rally. ⸻ Analyst upgrade Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on ImmunityBio and raised its price target from $5 to $7. This upgrade reflects increased confidence in the company’s regulatory progress and commercial prospects, contributing to positive investor sentiment and the stock’s strong gain. Revenue and trial updates ImmunityBio reported a 700% revenue increase in 2025, driven by rapid growth of its lead drug Anktiva. Clinical trials. I bought a few stocks yesterday m, just to test the waters. It seems to be very high risk & high reward kind of stock. Thoughts?",

What y ’ all say ImmunityBio NASDAQ IBRX is a smallmidcap biotech focused on cancer immunotherapy . It just received FDAapproval for a bladder cancer drug ANKTIVA . ImmunityBio is trying to trainboost the immune system especially NK cells T cells to fight cancer more effectively and for longer duration . Their flagship product is ANKTIVA nogapendekin alfa inbakiceptpmln an IL15 receptor agonist designed to activate immune cells . FDA progress ImmunityBio announced a Type B EndofPhase meeting with the FDA regarding its supplemental Biologics License Application for ANKTIVA plus Bacillus Calmette–Guérin in BCGunresponsive nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer . The FDA requested additional information but did not_require new clinical trials . ImmunityBio plans to submit the requested data within 30 days supporting a potential resubmission without further trials . This reduces regulatory uncertainty and supports the stock ’ s rally . ⸻ Analyst upgrade Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on ImmunityBio and raised its price target from $ 5 to $ 7 . This upgrade reflects increased confidence in the company ’ s regulatory progress and commercial prospects contributing to positive investor sentiment and the stock ’ s strong gain . Revenue and trial updates ImmunityBio reported a 700 % revenue increase in 2025 driven by rapid growth of its lead drug Anktiva . Clinical trials . I bought a few stocks yesterday m just to test the waters . It seems to be very high risk high reward kind of stock . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "[ Fortunately, scientists have figured out how to harness actinium-225's power for good. They can attach it to molecules that can home in on only cancer cells. In clinical trials treating late-stage prostate cancer patients, actinium-225 wiped out the cancer in three treatments. \"There is no residual impact of the prostate cancer. It's remarkable,” said Kevin John, a researcher at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Actinium-225 and treatments derived from it have also been used in [early trials]( for leukemia, melanoma, and glioma. But something stood in the way of expanding this treatment. For decades, one place in the world has produced the majority of actinium-225: DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Even with two other international facilities contributing smaller amounts, all three combined can only create enough actinium-225 to treat fewer than 100 patients annually. That's not enough to run anything but the most preliminary of clinical trials [ 1) Why don't US government speed up the approval for such drugs when the filing took place in June 2024? [ BWXT Medical Ltd., a subsidiary of BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BWXT) and NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes, LLC (NorthStar) today announced that they have signed a Master Services Agreement (MSA), which will facilitate the production of actinium-225 (Ac-225), a critical medical isotope used to kill cancer cells while minimizing the impact to healthy tissues. 2) Strategic US govt equity investment into BWXT, which can then be used to greatly speed up the production of Ac-225. If targeting 1kg of Ac-225 is even remotely attainable that can greatly pay down the US govt debt.",

In clinical trials treating latestage prostate cancer patients actinium225 wiped out the cancer in three treatments . There is no_residual impact of the prostate cancer . Its remarkable ” said Kevin John a researcher at the Department of Energys DOE Los Alamos National Laboratory LANL . Actinium225 and treatments derived from it have also been used in early trials for leukemia melanoma and glioma . But something stood in the way of expanding this treatment . For decades one place in the world has produced the majority of actinium225 DOEs Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL . Even with two other international facilities contributing smaller amounts all three combined can only create enough actinium225 to treat fewer than 100 patients annually . Thats not_enough to run anything but the most preliminary of clinical trials 1 Why dont US government speed up the approval for such drugs when the filing took place in June 2024 BWXT Medical Ltd. a subsidiary of BWX Technologies Inc. NYSE BWXT and NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes LLC NorthStar today announced that they have signed a Master Services Agreement MSA which will facilitate the production of actinium225 Ac225 a critical medical isotope used to kill cancer cells while minimizing the impact to healthy tissues . 2 Strategic US govt equity investment into BWXT which can then be used to greatly speed up the production of Ac225 . If targeting 1kg of Ac225 is even remotely attainable that can greatly pay down the US govt debt ."

      "selftext": "We have a 3 and 1 year old. Both have 529 accounts, but we don’t want to overfund in case they take a different route outside of college. Plus, we will roll over whichever maximum amount into a Roth IRA when the time comes. We are in a state where UTMA accounts can be granted at 21, and delayed until 25 if you decide. We would like to do the main portion of investing for them in these UTMA accounts. I am looking to build a good set it and forget it portfolio and buy 2-4 broad based stocks for them weekly/monthly. Based on my research, it seems like something like some allocation of VTI - VXUS - RSP - and QQQ would be decent. Would these 4 funds be a good base set it and forget it for weekly/monthly buys? If not, what funds? Also, what allocation of these or different funds? Appreciate everyone’s insight in helping set up our kids future!",

      "title": "Why copper investors should stop thinking in single tickers",
      "selftext": "The most interesting copper angle right now is not the price chart, it is the physics. Advanced systems like radar, satellites, lasers, and AI infrastructure are only practical at scale because copper can move power efficiently, carry heat away from dense electronics, and maintain grounding and signal integrity. Copper is not always the active ingredient, but without it, reliability and performance fall apart. That helps explain why demand projections look sticky. You shared estimates that global copper demand could rise from around 25 Mt per year today to 33-35 Mt by 2030 and potentially 50-55 Mt by 2050. Electrification adds copper intensity, and AI data centers add another layer because power distribution and thermal management become the limiting factors as rack densities climb. Now connect that to stocks. A single ticker rarely captures the whole copper setup because different parts of the pipeline respond differently. A producer can benefit from price strength and operational execution. A developer can move on permitting, capex clarity, and financing milestones. An explorer can move on targets and drilling, even without revenue. That is why I prefer a watchlist that spans risk layers. For producer exposure with different profiles, you could track Capstone Copper (TSX: CS, OTC: CSCCF), Lundin Mining (TSX: LUN, OTC: LUNMF), and First Quantum Minerals (TSX: FM, OTC: FQVLF). For the longer-cycle supply pipeline, Ivanhoe Mines (TSX: IVN, OTC: IVPAF) is a developer-style name people often associate with future copper supply. Then for pure optionality, keep Rumble Resources (CSE: RB, often shown as RB.CN on Yahoo Finance) as the speculative end of the barbell. If the demand drivers are structural and supply takes a decade-plus to respond, do you think the market starts rewarding the whole pipeline, or does it still mostly pay producers and ignore the upstream names?

      "selftext_processed": "The most interesting copper angle right now is not_the price chart it is the physics . Advanced systems like radar satellites lasers and AI infrastructure are only practical at scale because copper can move power efficiently carry heat away from dense electronics and maintain grounding and signal integrity . Copper is not_always the active ingredient but without it reliability and performance fall apart . That helps explain why demand projections look sticky . You shared estimates that global copper demand could rise from around 25 Mt per year today to 3335 Mt by 2030 and potentially 5055 Mt by 2050 . Electrification adds copper intensity and AI data centers add another layer because power distribution and thermal management become the limiting factors as rack densities climb . Now connect that to stocks . A single ticker rarely captures the whole copper setup because different parts of the pipeline respond differently . A producer can benefit from price strength and operational execution . A developer can move on permitting capex clarity and financing milestones . An explorer can move on targets and drilling even without revenue . That is why I prefer a watchlist that spans risk layers . For producer exposure with different profiles you could track Capstone Copper TSX CS OTC CSCCF Lundin Mining TSX LUN OTC LUNMF and First Quantum Minerals TSX FM OTC FQVLF . For the longercycle supply pipeline Ivanhoe Mines TSX IVN OTC IVPAF is a developerstyle name people often associate with future copper supply . Then for pure optionality keep Rumble Resources CSE RB often shown as RB.CN on Yahoo Finance as the speculative end of the barbell . If the demand drivers are structural and supply takes a decadeplus to respond do you think the market starts rewarding the whole pipeline or does it still mostly pay producers and ignore the upstream names NFA ."

      "selftext": "RIME’s recent move makes more sense when you treat it as a reclassification event. For a long time, the ticker was mentally filed under \"legacy junk\" and ignored. Once that mental label breaks, price can move fast because the market isn’t updating a price target, it’s updating a category. The numbers behind the new category are what matter. SemiCab’s deck points to enterprise-scale execution: about 173K loads run through the platform in a defined window, roughly 77% optimized, with around 11.7M miles removed and about $28.5M saved on roughly $340M of freight spend. That’s an 8%+ savings impact. Not theory. Then compare that to what the market is valuing the company at. With roughly 2.72M shares outstanding, even around the $0.80–$1.00 zone you’re talking about a market cap of only \\~$2.4M to $2.7M. That’s tiny relative to the scale implied by multi-million annual contracts and ARR discussion. That’s why the tape changed. When people stop thinking \"old business\" and start thinking \"logistics optimization with measurable savings,\" they stop selling dips and start buying them. Not advice, do your own reading.",

      "selftext": "Bloomberg) -- The Danish pension fund AkademikerPension is planning to exit US Treasuries by the end of the month, amid concerns that the policies of President Donald Trump have created credit risks too big to ignore. “The US is basically not a good credit and long-term the US government finances are not sustainable,” Anders Schelde, chief investment officer at AkademikerPension, told Bloomberg on Tuesday. AkademikerPension, which manages around $25 billion in savings for teachers and academics, held about $100 million in US Treasuries at the end of 2025, Schelde said. Risk and liquidity management is the only reason to remain in Treasuries, and “we decided that we can find alternative to that,” he said. Schelde cited Trump’s threats to take over Greenland as part of the reason to sell US Treasuries. But concerns about fiscal discipline and a weaker dollar also justify a retreat from US exposure, he said.",

AkademikerPension which manages around $ 25 billion in savings for teachers and academics held about $ 100 million in US Treasuries at the end of 2025 Schelde said . Risk and liquidity management is the only reason to remain in Treasuries and “ we decided that we can find alternative to that ” he said . Schelde cited Trump ’ s threats to take over Greenland as part of the reason to sell US Treasuries . But concerns about fiscal discipline and a weaker dollar also justify a retreat from US exposure he said ."

My investment strategy is largely VOO and chill. I just took control of most of my retirement funds in rollover IRAs and HSAs. In my young 30s and just crossed the $100k in networth - and 80% of it is in VOO because I just want to do time in the market. However, I'm partially convinced the Trump administration's strategy is to make a ridiculous geopolitical move that is \"pre-announced\" on a Friday to give investors time to speculate and time the market, and point to sudden bull runs when their approval rating dips. Then again, things haven't moved in a way one would expect with Venezuela. Gone are the days where conventional wisdom applies given unconditional politics? Try and time the market or should I focus more on the chill part of VOO & chill?",

My investment strategy is largely VOO and chill . I just took control of most of my retirement funds in rollover IRAs and HSAs . In my young 30s and just crossed the $ 100k in networth and 80 % of it is in VOO because I just want to do time in the market . However Im partially convinced the Trump administrations strategy is to make a ridiculous geopolitical move that is preannounced on a Friday to give investors time to speculate and time the market and point to sudden bull runs when their approval rating dips . Then again things havent moved in a way one would expect with Venezuela . Gone are the days where conventional wisdom applies given unconditional politics Try and time the market or should I focus more on the chill part of VOO chill"

Stocks free fall again like they did in April 2025, but back then the Trump admin did try damage control and paused or rolled back measures and reached deals with several partners. However, it looks quite different this time. Trump has a very specific demand that the EU is entirely unwilling to budge on, and moreover, he is much less grounded than he was last year. It seems extremely likely that he'll stick to the tariffs he threatened. We have to be in for a long winter.",

      "selftext": "# # Part I: The Political Detonator: The Takaichi Gambit and the 4% Barrier Since our last assessment, the \"Great Liquidity Era\" has entered a chaotic terminal phase. On January 19, 2026, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s first female premier, shattered the remaining market calm by calling a snap election for February 8, 2026. This is not a standard political maneuver; it is a high-stakes referendum on \"proactive fiscal spending\" that has effectively declared war on the bond market. The Super-Long Yield Shock While the world was watching the 10-year JGB, the real carnage has moved to the \"back end\" of the curve. The 30-year JGB yield has ripped to 3.83%, while the 40-year yield has pierced the psychological 4.0% ceiling. This is a structural shift in the Term Premium. Investors are no longer just pricing in higher overnight rates; they are pricing in fiscal risk. The Takaichi administration’s proposal to cut sales taxes on food, estimated to cost the treasury 0.6% of GDP, has signaled to the world that Japan is opting for populism over solvency. The Mathematics of Maturity For thirty years, Japan’s debt was \"sustainable\" because it was pinned to a zero-bound. Today, that debt is being repriced at the speed of a high-frequency trade. * **The Yield Velocity:** The speed ($dy/dt$) of the move in the 30-year bond is now outpacing its G7 peers. * **The Duration Trap:** Because Japan’s debt has a high average maturity, these moves in the 30-year and 40-year yields are devastating. For every 10-basis point move in the super-long end, the \"mark-to-market\" loss on the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) balance sheet and the portfolios of domestic \"lifers\" (insurers) is catastrophic. # Part II: The Policy Paradox: BOJ vs. Ministry of Finance We are now witnessing the \"Truss-ification\" of the Japanese Yen. The dynamic between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has shifted from coordination to active sabotage. The MoF’s Debt Servicing Nightmare The Ministry of Finance has officially raised its \"assumed interest rate\" for the FY2026 budget to 3.0%, the highest in nearly three decades. At this level, Japan’s debt servicing costs are projected to explode to over 31.3 trillion yen. > The BOJ’s Mandate of Thorns Governor Ueda and the BOJ are trapped. * To fight inflation (core at 2.6%), the BOJ must raise the policy rate and reduce JGB purchases (Quantitative Tightening). * To save the MoF, the BOJ would need to restart Yield Curve Control (YCC) to cap the 30-year yield at 4%. However, if the BOJ caps yields while the MoF prints money for stimulus, the Yen collapses. If the BOJ allows yields to market-price, the MoF goes insolvent. They are no longer partners; they are two pilots fighting for control of the same stick while the plane is in a nose-dive. # Part III: The Yen Carry Trade Unwind: The Great Repatriation The surge in the 40-year yield to 4% has changed the \"Internal Rate of Return\" (IRR) for Japan’s massive institutional investors. This is the \"Passive Structural Breach\" we feared. Japanese life insurers and pension funds, the world's largest \"whales\", no longer need to hunt for yield in 4.5% US Treasuries. When you factor in the cost of hedging USD/JPY volatility, a 4% risk-free return in their home currency (JPY) is mathematically superior to a 4.8% return in USD. The \"Infinite Money Glitch\" hasn't just stopped; it has reversed. The trillions of Yen that fueled the Nasdaq and the US housing market are being pulled back to Tokyo to fund the Japanese government's record-breaking interest bill. For thirty years, the global financial system has operated on a hidden subsidy: the Japanese Yen. It was the \"infinite money glitch,\" a fountain of cheap capital that fueled the greatest bull market in human history. But yesterday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) did not just raise rates; they shattered the glass floor. With the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield finally piercing the 2.02% threshold, the \"Great Liquidity Era\" has officially met its end. As your bored Ape in this shifting landscape, I need you to understand that we are not just looking at a currency fluctuation. We are looking at the potential structural failure of the global carry trade. If you are not watching the Yen, you are flying blind into a hurricane. # I. The Architecture of the Glitch: 30 Years of QE and YCC Since 1990, Japan has been a laboratory for \"Extraordinary Monetary Policy.\" To fight a demographic death spiral and entrenched deflation, the BOJ pioneered Quantitative Easing (QE) and Yield Curve Control (YCC). By pinning JGB yields near zero, the BOJ effectively shorted its own currency to subsidize global growth. This birthed the Yen Carry Trade: investors borrow JPY at near-zero rates, sell it for USD, and buy high-yielding US Treasuries or high-growth Nasdaq tech. This was not just a trade; it was a systemic short-volatility bet. As long as Japan stayed \"frozen,\" the world had a \"BOJ Put.\" However, that era of artificial stability created a massive build-up of kinetic energy that is now beginning to discharge. # II. The Mathematics of the Shock: Velocity Over Levels The mistake most retail investors make is focusing on the absolute level of JGB interest rates. In the halls of institutional finance, we care about Velocity ($dy/dt$). The absolute yield matters for long-term solvency, but the speed of the move matters for immediate survival. The carry trade is governed by the Expected Excess Return ($E\\_r$): $$Expected Return = Leverage \\* \\[ (Asset Yield - Japanese Funding Rate) + Currency Drift - Volatility Premium \\]$$ **Variable Breakdown** * **Leverage (L):** This is your Multiplier. Institutional carry trades are rarely executed with simple cash. They are typically levered 3x to 10x. This variable acts as a force multiplier, magnifying every basis point of movement in the following variables for better or, increasingly, for worse. * **Asset Yield:** Your Target Return. This represents the yield of the asset you are buying with the borrowed Yen, typically the US 10-Year Treasury yield or the S&P 500 earnings yield. * **Japanese Funding Rate:** Your Cost of Carry. This is the interest rate you pay to borrow the Yen. As the BOJ pushes yields toward 2.5%, this cost eats directly into your profit margin, narrowing the \"spread.\" * **Currency Drift:** The Exchange Rate Delta. This is the percentage change in the value of the Yen. If the Yen appreciates, you are forced to pay back your loan with more expensive currency. Even a small move here can instantly wipe out years of interest gains. * **Volatility/Fear Premium:** The Risk Tax. This represents the cost of hedging your position or the added risk-premium required to hold the trade. When markets get jittery, this value spikes, often making the trade mathematically unviable for risk-managed funds before they even lose money on the interest rates. When JGB yields \"gap\" higher in a matter of days, the Value-at-Risk (VaR) models of every major bank go \"code red.\" This triggers an explosion in the $\\\\sigma\\_{fx}$ variable, causing the Sharpe ratio of the trade to collapse. The trade does not just stop; it unwinds. A rapid spike in yields triggers a forced buyback of Yen to close out loans, creating the Feedback Loop of Doom. # III. The Bridge to 2.5%: From Volatility Shock to Passive Breach While a sudden spike in yields creates a \"Volatility Shock,\" which is a violent, short-term liquidation, a breach of the 2.5% JGB level represents something far more dangerous: a Passive Structural Breach. If USD/JPY reaches 170, the BOJ’s hand is forced. The cost of imported energy creates an \"Inflationary Breach\" that threatens social stability. To defend the currency, the BOJ must allow JGB yields to climb toward 2.5%. Once yields pass 2.5%, the carry trade does not \"crash\" due to panic. Instead, it evaporates due to math. At 2.5%, the net spread between JPY borrowing and USD assets hits zero. Japanese institutional giants simply bring their trillions home to earn a risk-free return in their own currency, creating a permanent exit of liquidity that global markets cannot replace. # IV. The Mechanics of the Unwind: The Liquidation Feedback Loop When the yen carry trade unwinds, it does not happen in a vacuum. It triggers a mechanical, cross-asset contagion. This is the \"Gravity\" phase of the cycle. * **The Treasury Sell-Off (The Initial Trigger):** As Japanese yields approach the 2.5% \"Death Zone,\" Japanese banks and insurers stop buying. To shore up domestic balance sheets, they begin selling their US holdings. This floods the market with supply just as the US Treasury is trying to fund a record deficit. * **The Result:** US 10-year yields spike toward 5.5% or 6.0%. * **The Equity Market Margin Call:** Most of the \"borrowed\" Yen is parked in high-beta growth stocks and crypto. As US Treasury yields spike, the discount rate for these equities rises, causing their valuations to compress. * **The Feedback Loop:** Falling stock prices trigger margin calls for carry traders. To pay back their JPY loans, they must sell more stocks. This selling forces them to buy back Yen, which makes the Yen stronger, making the remaining JPY loans even more expensive to pay back. * **The Liquidity Vacuum:** Because the Fed and BOJ are \"boxed in,\" there is no buyer of last resort. Private credit markets freeze as the cost of capital becomes unpredictable. In this phase, the correlation between all risk assets moves to 1.0, and everything sells off at once. # V. The Boxed-In Reality: The Death of the US Fed Volatility Suppressor We are witnessing the terminal phase of central bank omnipotence. For decades, the US Federal Reserve acted as the world's ultimate Volatility Suppressor. Whenever the system shook, the Fed injected liquidity to dampen the Ofx variable. But today, the Fed and the BOJ are trapped in a mutually assured destruction (MAD) framework. The BOJ is boxed in by the Yen's survival. If they do not raise rates, the Yen collapses toward 170 and imports hyper-inflation. If they do raise rates, they trigger a global margin call. **The Fed is boxed in by the Inflationary Wall. With US inflation remaining sticky, the Fed has lost its dampening powers. They can no longer suppress volatility because the very act of suppression now fuels the fire of inflation. The \"Volatility Suppressor\" has been unplugged.** # VI. Conclusion: The Dual Tail Risk and the Inevitable Meltdown We are navigating two distinct, catastrophic outcomes, but they both terminate at the same point: the liquidation of global leverage. * **The 140 Tail (Deflationary Spiral):** A sudden, violent surge in the Yen to 140. This is the \"fast-death\" scenario, which is a mechanical margin call that liquidates the world’s equities to pay back JPY loans. * **The 170 Tail (The Inflationary Breach):** This is the most likely path. As the Yen bleeds out to 170, the BOJ is forced to jack JGB yields to 2.5% to stop the hemorrhage. This causes the Passive Breach, which is the \"slow-death\" scenario where Japanese capital is sucked out of US markets, causing a relentless sell-off in Treasuries and equities. The Yen carry trade unwind is now mathematically inevitable. For the first time in the modern era, the Fed cannot print its way out of a liquidity crisis without destroying its own currency. Across the entire vector of assets, including equities, crypto, and private credit, the VaR is exploding. **Volatility is no longer being dampened; it is being amplified. The US Fed volatility suppression is now impotent**. The trillions of Yen that once acted as global lubricant are being pulled back to Tokyo. The detonator has been triggered, the fuse is burning, and 170 is the point of no return.",

      "selftext_processed": "Part I The Political Detonator The Takaichi Gambit and the 4 % Barrier Since our last assessment the Great Liquidity Era has entered a chaotic terminal phase . On January 19 2026 Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi Japan ’ s first female premier shattered the remaining market calm by calling a snap election for February 8 2026 . This is not_a standard political maneuver it is a highstakes referendum on proactive fiscal spending that has effectively declared war on the bond market . The SuperLong Yield Shock While the world was watching the 10year JGB the real carnage has moved to the back end of the curve . The 30year JGB yield has ripped to 3.83 % while the 40year yield has pierced the psychological 4.0 % ceiling . This is a structural shift in the Term Premium . Investors are no_longer just pricing in higher overnight rates they are pricing in fiscal risk . The Takaichi administration ’ s proposal to cut sales taxes on food estimated to cost the treasury 0.6 % of GDP has signaled to the world that Japan is opting for populism over solvency . The Mathematics of Maturity For thirty years Japan ’ s debt was sustainable because it was pinned to a zerobound . Today that debt is being repriced at the speed of a highfrequency trade . The Yield Velocity The speed $ dydt $ of the move in the 30year bond is now outpacing its G7 peers . The Duration Trap Because Japan ’ s debt has a high average maturity these moves in the 30year and 40year yields are devastating . For every 10basis point move in the superlong end the marktomarket loss on the Bank of Japan ’ s BOJ balance sheet and the portfolios of domestic lifers insurers is catastrophic . Part II The Policy Paradox BOJ vs. Ministry of Finance We are now witnessing the Trussification of the Japanese Yen . The dynamic between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance MoF has shifted from coordination to active sabotage . The MoF ’ s Debt Servicing Nightmare The Ministry of Finance has officially raised its assumed interest rate for the FY2026 budget to 3.0 % the highest in nearly three decades . At this level Japan ’ s debt servicing costs are projected to explode to over 31.3 trillion yen . The BOJ ’ s Mandate of Thorns Governor Ueda and the BOJ are trapped . To fight inflation core at 2.6 % the BOJ must raise the policy rate and reduce JGB purchases Quantitative Tightening . To save the MoF the BOJ would need to restart Yield Curve Control YCC to cap the 30year yield at 4 % . However if the BOJ caps yields while the MoF prints money for stimulus the Yen collapses . If the BOJ allows yields to marketprice the MoF goes insolvent . They are no_longer partners they are two pilots fighting for control of the same stick while the plane is in a nosedive . Part III The Yen Carry Trade Unwind The Great Repatriation The surge in the 40year yield to 4 % has changed the Internal Rate of Return IRR for Japan ’ s massive institutional investors . This is the Passive Structural Breach we feared . Japanese life insurers and pension funds the worlds largest whales no_longer need to hunt for yield in 4.5 % US Treasuries . When you factor in the cost of hedging USDJPY volatility a 4 % riskfree return in their home currency JPY is mathematically superior to a 4.8 % return in USD . The Infinite Money Glitch hasnt just stopped it has reversed . The trillions of Yen that fueled the Nasdaq and the US housing market are being pulled back to Tokyo to fund the Japanese governments recordbreaking interest bill . For thirty years the global financial system has operated on a hidden subsidy the Japanese Yen . It was the infinite money glitch a fountain of cheap capital that fueled the greatest bull market in human history . But yesterday the Bank of Japan BOJ did not_just raise rates they shattered the glass floor . With the 10year Japanese Government Bond JGB yield finally piercing the 2.02 % threshold the Great Liquidity Era has officially met its end . As your bored Ape in this shifting landscape I need you to understand that we are not_just looking at a currency fluctuation . We are looking at the potential structural failure of the global carry trade . If you are not_watching the Yen you are flying blind into a hurricane . I . The Architecture of the Glitch 30 Years of QE and YCC Since 1990 Japan has been a laboratory for Extraordinary Monetary Policy . To fight a demographic death spiral and entrenched deflation the BOJ pioneered Quantitative Easing QE and Yield Curve Control YCC . By pinning JGB yields near zero the BOJ effectively shorted its own currency to subsidize global growth . This birthed the Yen Carry Trade investors borrow JPY at nearzero rates sell it for USD and buy highyielding US Treasuries or highgrowth Nasdaq tech . This was not_just a trade it was a systemic shortvolatility bet . As long as Japan stayed frozen the world had a BOJ Put . However that era of artificial stability created a massive buildup of kinetic energy that is now beginning to discharge . II . The Mathematics of the Shock Velocity Over Levels The mistake most retail investors make is focusing on the absolute level of JGB interest rates . In the halls of institutional finance we care about Velocity $ dydt $ . The absolute yield matters for longterm solvency but the speed of the move matters for immediate survival . The carry trade is governed by the Expected Excess Return $ E_r $ $ $ Expected Return Leverage Asset Yield Japanese Funding Rate Currency Drift Volatility Premium $ $ Variable Breakdown Leverage L This is your Multiplier . Institutional carry trades are rarely executed with simple cash . They are typically levered 3x to 10x . This variable acts as a force multiplier magnifying every basis point of movement in the following variables for better or increasingly for worse . Asset Yield Your Target Return . This represents the yield of the asset you are buying with the borrowed Yen typically the US 10Year Treasury yield or the SP 500 earnings yield . Japanese Funding Rate Your Cost of Carry . This is the interest rate you pay to borrow the Yen . As the BOJ pushes yields toward 2.5 % this cost eats directly into your profit margin narrowing the spread . Currency Drift The Exchange Rate Delta . This is the percentage change in the value of the Yen . If the Yen appreciates you are forced to pay back your loan with more expensive currency . Even a small move here can instantly wipe out years of interest gains . VolatilityFear Premium The Risk Tax . This represents the cost of hedging your position or the added riskpremium required to hold the trade . When markets get jittery this value spikes often making the trade mathematically unviable for riskmanaged funds before they even lose money on the interest rates . When JGB yields gap higher in a matter of days the ValueatRisk VaR models of every major bank go code red . This triggers an explosion in the $ sigma_fx $ variable causing the Sharpe ratio of the trade to collapse . The trade does not_just stop it unwinds . A rapid spike in yields triggers a forced buyback of Yen to close out loans creating the Feedback Loop of Doom . III . The Bridge to 2.5 % From Volatility Shock to Passive Breach While a sudden spike in yields creates a Volatility Shock which is a violent shortterm liquidation a breach of the 2.5 % JGB level represents something far more dangerous a Passive Structural Breach . If USDJPY reaches 170 the BOJ ’ s hand is forced . The cost of imported energy creates an Inflationary Breach that threatens social stability . To defend the currency the BOJ must allow JGB yields to climb toward 2.5 % . Once yields pass 2.5 % the carry trade does not_crash due to panic . Instead it evaporates due to math . At 2.5 % the net spread between JPY borrowing and USD assets hits zero . Japanese institutional giants simply bring their trillions home to earn a riskfree return in their own currency creating a permanent exit of liquidity that global markets can not replace . IV . The Mechanics of the Unwind The Liquidation Feedback Loop When the yen carry trade unwinds it does not_happen in a vacuum . It triggers a mechanical crossasset contagion . This is the Gravity phase of the cycle . The Treasury SellOff The Initial Trigger As Japanese yields approach the 2.5 % Death Zone Japanese banks and insurers stop buying . To shore up domestic balance sheets they begin selling their US holdings . This floods the market with supply just as the US Treasury is trying to fund a record deficit . The Result US 10year yields spike toward 5.5 % or 6.0 % . The Equity Market Margin Call Most of the borrowed Yen is parked in highbeta growth stocks and crypto . As US Treasury yields spike the discount rate for these equities rises causing their valuations to compress . The Feedback Loop Falling stock prices trigger margin calls for carry traders . To pay back their JPY loans they must sell more stocks . This selling forces them to buy back Yen which makes the Yen stronger making the remaining JPY loans even more expensive to pay back . The Liquidity Vacuum Because the Fed and BOJ are boxed in there is no_buyer of last resort . Private credit markets freeze as the cost of capital becomes unpredictable . In this phase the correlation between all risk assets moves to 1.0 and everything sells off at once . V. The BoxedIn Reality The Death of the US Fed Volatility Suppressor We are witnessing the terminal phase of central bank omnipotence . For decades the US Federal Reserve acted as the worlds ultimate Volatility Suppressor . Whenever the system shook the Fed injected liquidity to dampen the Ofx variable . But today the Fed and the BOJ are trapped in a mutually assured destruction MAD framework . The BOJ is boxed in by the Yens survival . If they do not_raise rates the Yen collapses toward 170 and imports hyperinflation . If they do raise rates they trigger a global margin call . The Fed is boxed in by the Inflationary Wall . With US inflation remaining sticky the Fed has lost its dampening powers . They can no_longer suppress volatility because the very act of suppression now fuels the fire of inflation . The Volatility Suppressor has been unplugged . VI . Conclusion The Dual Tail Risk and the Inevitable Meltdown We are navigating two distinct catastrophic outcomes but they both terminate at the same point the liquidation of global leverage . The 140 Tail Deflationary Spiral A sudden violent surge in the Yen to 140 . This is the fastdeath scenario which is a mechanical margin call that liquidates the world ’ s equities to pay back JPY loans . The 170 Tail The Inflationary Breach This is the most likely path . As the Yen bleeds out to 170 the BOJ is forced to jack JGB yields to 2.5 % to stop the hemorrhage . This causes the Passive Breach which is the slowdeath scenario where Japanese capital is sucked out of US markets causing a relentless selloff in Treasuries and equities . The Yen carry trade unwind is now mathematically inevitable . For the first time in the modern era the Fed can not print its way out of a liquidity crisis without destroying its own currency . Across the entire vector of assets including equities crypto and private credit the VaR is exploding . Volatility is no_longer being dampened it is being amplified . The US Fed volatility suppression is now impotent . The trillions of Yen that once acted as global lubricant are being pulled back to Tokyo . The detonator has been triggered the fuse is burning and 170 is the point of no_return ."

      "selftext": "Posting this because the last few threads here were really insightful. Yields on Treasuries have been relatively high over the past few months, and some parts of the curve have even moved up. Yet, the indexes (S&P, Nasdaq) are still near highs. Historically, rising yields should put pressure on equity valuations through higher discount rates, but that doesn’t seem to be happening in full force. I’m curious how people here are thinking about this: 1. At what point do yields start to matter for stocks? 2.Is it the absolute level, the speed of change, or how long rates stay elevated? 3.Are you adjusting your view on risk when yields are high but leadership remains narrow? Not looking to predict a top or crash... just trying to understand how people mentally factor rates into equity risk, or whether most just ignore yields and focus on earnings and price action. Would love to hear how others here are framing it.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I don't own any individual stocks, and most of my investments are in growth mutual funds. I have some bond exposure in my 401k, but everything in my personal accounts is a mix between S&P500 (FXAIX), large cap growth (FSPGX) and semiconductor (FSELX.) I do realize there's quite a bit of overlap between these three mutual funds. Looking at the performance over the few years I've owned these, FSELX has blown everything out of the water by a large margin. Now I'm more inclined to invest a larger percentage of my money in FSELX. I realize we don't have crystal balls and we can't predict the future, but can you think of plausible scenarios where the semiconductor, microchip and AI sectors completely go bust? The more I look at the world around me, the more I'm convinced there's no plausible way, but I would love to hear your opinions. Many thanks in advance!! =)",

There is a short interest of about 13%, or 27% of total float … and occasionally gets tested in this day & age. However around July the story changed: \\\\- dividend cut (saves $20M per Q) \\\\- cost cuts related to poor $mcd partnership \\\\- outsourced awful fleet of trucks & costs there (halfway done) \\\\- new COO whos a NZ baller and also plump \\\\- going asset light akin to a $YUM or $MCD model of refranchising \\\\- closing grocery & leaning on $cost $tgt $wmt \\\\- Giant new store in MN, strategic non cannabilizing sales… $1M in first 17 days By last Q ended 10/31 \\\\- we had positive FCF of $15M (wtf .. havent seen positive in like 2 yrs) \\\\- cutting the debt by refranchising (i.e. Japan $65M) nice royalty expected and super asset light \\\\- plan is working Summary: \\\\- $60M in debt payments per year is nuts still, this doesnt deserve any premium multiple on FCF \\\\- \\\\\\~$60-75M in FCF this year, however DOES does deserve a minimum multiple of 10x, as the growth of FCF would be astronomic \\\\- A few more large refranchising deals later, and they can slice a serious chunk of debt down to $6-700M, assuming they just hold revenues flat, and FCF would grow even more… \\\\- At $3.5 a share, or sub $600M market cap, the expectations are that they will fail quickly. Even just basic execution, and the 10x multiple on FCF will begin to draw attention especially if they can show 1-2 more positive quarters Target $6-8 by April/May \\\\-20% in a week on no news is classic Krispy Not investment advice \\\\- No Doctor",

There is a short interest of about 13 % or 27 % of total float … and occasionally gets tested in this day age . However around July the story changed dividend cut saves $ 20M per Q cost cuts related to poor $ mcd partnership outsourced awful fleet of trucks costs there halfway done new COO whos a NZ baller and also plump going asset light akin to a $ YUM or $ MCD model of refranchising closing grocery leaning on $ cost $ tgt $ wmt Giant new store in MN strategic non cannabilizing sales… $ 1M in first 17 days By last Q ended 1031 we had positive FCF of $ 15M wtf .. havent seen positive in like 2 yrs cutting the debt by refranchising i.e . Japan $ 65M nice royalty expected and super asset light plan is working Summary $ 60M in debt payments per year is nuts still this doesnt deserve any premium multiple on FCF $ 6075M in FCF this year however DOES does deserve a minimum multiple of 10x as the growth of FCF would be astronomic A few more large refranchising deals later and they can slice a serious chunk of debt down to $ 6700M assuming they just hold revenues flat and FCF would grow even more… At $ 3.5 a share or sub $ 600M market cap the expectations are that they will fail quickly . Even just basic execution and the 10x multiple on FCF will begin to draw attention especially if they can show 12 more positive quarters Target $ 68 by AprilMay 20 % in a week on no_news is classic Krispy Not_investment advice No_Doctor"

I’d done 183 percent last year on AI stocks I sold out of completely like NBIS at 20$ during April. This is just the most ridiculous misplacing in an overpriced market. Now here’s the reason you need to be buying TTD. **Midterms.** If you take a gander at every time Trade Desk has massive earnings surprises to the upside it’s on political campaign years. TTD is at the same price it was at in June of 2020. The company is just getting destroyed but it’s also one of the most watched stocks currently on the market. Nobody wants TTD, sentiment couldn’t be worse. But watch as sentiment changes, everyone is bearish until just one positive happens with a company. At minimum you have an incredible margin of safety. If they kill earnings for two quarters at this price the forward PE goes from 18- to 12,13. And BTW TTD could implement their own AI system.",

Isn't the downside already priced in and the only logical way to go is up? That's what I figured at $195 and now its $185. I don't think I have the tolerance to watch it drop any lower but at the same time I don't want to feel like an even bigger idiot on February 4th when they announce earnings and the stock bounces back up to $230+. My real nightmare scenario is that the earnings call is bad and it drops even lower to like $170. Is thst possible? What do you guys think the likelihood of a good earnings call is in Feb? I genuinely had faith in TMO because they're always making huge moves but the general consensus seems to be \"the growth story is over, its boring now, sell the stock and forget about it\"",

Will this nightmare ever end Isnt the downside already priced in and the only logical way to go is up Thats what I figured at $ 195 and now its $ 185 . I dont think I have the tolerance to watch it drop any lower but at the same time I dont want to feel like an even bigger idiot on February 4th when they announce earnings and the stock bounces back up to $ 230 . My real nightmare scenario is that the earnings call is bad and it drops even lower to like $ 170 . Is thst possible What do you guys think the likelihood of a good earnings call is in Feb I genuinely had faith in TMO because theyre always making huge moves but the general consensus seems to be the growth story is over its boring now sell the stock and forget about it"

      "selftext": "Russell 2000 hit an all-time high Friday and has now outperformed the S&P 500 for 11 straight days - longest streak since June 2008. **Whats driving this?** The thesis is straightforward.. stock prices track earnings growth over time. Since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, S&P 500 earnings have grown around 27% cumulatively, driven largely by the AI buildout and concentrated in mega-cap tech. Small-cap earnings over that period? Essentially flat. That equation is now reversing: * Nasdaq 100 earnings growth is decelerating.. +36.8% in 2024 down to +18% expected in 2025 * Meanwhile earnings growth for the broader market is accelerating Looking at 2026 expectations per FactSet: * S&P 500: +15% * S&P 400 mid-caps: +17% * S&P 600 small-caps: +19% * Russell 2000: +60% (includes companies currently unprofitable turning positive) **Why small caps specifically?** Small-cap strength historically signals investor confidence in the domestic economy - these companies have less international exposure. It also suggests expectations for continued rate cuts since smaller companies tend to carry more leverage and benefit more from lower borrowing costs. **The counter-argument:** Small caps are notoriously volatile and have underperformed large caps for most of the past decade. The Russell 2000 only recently broke out of a multi-year range. Some argue this is just mean reversion rather than a durable trend shift. **Also worth noting on precious metals:** Gold and silver have gone parabolic since last April with silver more than tripling. Central banks have been aggressively adding to gold reserves while diversifying away from Treasuries. However the gold/S&P 500 ratio is now sitting right at its long-term average - historically for gold to continue outperforming from here would require either excessive stock valuations or global financial instability (like 2008 or the early 80s inflation). 🗄️ Please see disclaimers here: [Redditr/dubapp]( Curious what everyone's thinking heading into earnings season 👇",

      "selftext": "I've been posting my thesis for some of the stocks below on why I think they are undervalued, feel free to roast me or not, although I feel pretty secure about them. **1. Amaroq Minerals ($AMRQ)** * **Thesis:** Amaroq has successfully transitioned from \"explorer\" to \"producer,\" recently beating FY25 gold production guidance. The real story is strategic: The West is desperate to secure critical minerals (Gold/Copper) outside of Chinese influence, and Amaroq effectively owns the rights to South Greenland. * **2026 Catalyst:** The Phase 2 plant upgrade lands in Q2 2026. This boosts recovery rates to \\~90%, turning this into a cash-flow machine just as gold prices hold historic highs. **2. Ferrari ($RACE)** * **Thesis:** Stop looking at P/E ratios; this trades like Hermès, not Ford. The order book is entirely sold out through 2026. Their customer base is immune to interest rates and inflation, and they have arguably the strongest pricing power of any company on earth. * **2026 Catalyst:** Lewis Hamilton’s second season in Red + the imminent launch of their first EV. The market expects the EV to be sold out before the public even sees it. **3. Aston Martin ($AML)** * **Thesis:** The contrarian pick. The stock has been battered, creating a distressed valuation (0.4x sales). The thesis relies entirely on the successful delivery of the *Valhalla* supercar in 2026 and debt stabilization. * **2026 Catalyst:** If they deliver cars on time this year, the stock re-rates from \"bankruptcy risk\" to \"luxury brand.\" High risk, massive potential upside. **4. Fluor ($FLR)** * **Thesis:** Fluor has \"de-risked\" its backlog, 82% of its contracts are now reimbursable (meaning the client pays for cost overruns, not Fluor). They are the ones actually building the data centers for hyperscalers and have a massive footprint in the Nuclear/SMR renaissance. * **2026 Catalyst:** Aggressive share buybacks continuing through Feb 2026 and the monetization of their NuScale (SMR) stake. **5. L3Harris ($LHX)** * **Thesis:** Unlike the slow-moving \"metal benders\" (Lockheed/Northrop), LHX focuses on the high-growth tech layer of defense: space, cyber, and comms. They are the \"trusted disruptor\" in a sector seeing increased budget allocation. * **2026 Catalyst:** The planned spin-off of their Missile Solutions unit later in 2026. This unlocks shareholder value and leaves a leaner, higher-margin tech core. **6. Capital One ($COF)** * **Thesis:** The play is the Discover acquisition. By owning the Discover network, COF creates a closed-loop system (issuer + network) that lets them bypass Visa/Mastercard fees and capture the entire transaction margin. Even without it, it’s a tech-forward bank trading at a value multiple. (10% C/C Cap Highly Unlikely to go through) * **2026 Catalyst:** Realizing the projected $2.7B in synergies. **7. NextEra Energy ($NEE)** * **Thesis:** AI Data centers consume an insane amount of electricity. NextEra is the largest renewable developer in the US and the only one with the scale (\\~30GW backlog) to power the AI boom. You get the safety of a regulated utility (Florida Power & Light) attached to a high-growth tech play. * **2026 Catalyst:** Confirmed 10% dividend growth through 2026 and massive demand from hyperscalers (Google/Microsoft) signing long-term power purchase agreements.",

      "selftext": "I’m not usually a metals investor. I mostly stick to equities, ETFs, and some crypto. But given the current political and macro backdrop, I’m starting to question whether ignoring gold and silver right now is actually the bigger risk. Gold and silver have been in a very strong uptrend over the past days and weeks. Gold is trading around $4,675–$4,690/oz, up roughly +1.8% to +1.9% today, while silver is near $94/oz, up +5% to +6.6% today. Silver has been especially volatile, up about +25% YTD (2026) and roughly +200% over the past year. From a macro perspective, this looks like a classic **safe-haven rally**, driven by several overlapping factors: * **Geopolitical tensions**: renewed trade-war risks, US–Europe tariff threats, and broader instability are pushing investors toward defensive assets. * **Macro uncertainty**: a weaker US dollar, uncertainty around Fed leadership and rate cuts, persistent inflation, and rising global debt levels. * **Central bank behavior**: continued strong gold purchases, especially from China, as part of reserve diversification. * **Silver-specific dynamics**: rising industrial demand (electrification, AI infrastructure, crypto-related hardware), structural supply deficits, export restrictions, and its classification as a critical mineral in the US. Some analysts (Citi, JPMorgan) are talking about **$5,000 gold** and **$100 silver** into 2026, though that obviously comes with downside risks. A pullback from profit-taking seems very possible after such a sharp move, even if the broader trend remains bullish. I’m personally conflicted. On one hand, this feels late in the move. On the other, if the political and macro situation deteriorates further, not having any exposure to precious metals could be a blind spot in my portfolio. I’m not looking at physical metals, but rather trading exposure, which makes it easier to follow institutional flows and manage risk. That said, I’m aware metals behave very differently from equities and crypto. Even crypto platforms, Bitget, for example, now offer gold and silver trading through their TradFi products, which I’ve already tested from a trading perspective. Execution is fast and fees are low. Given the current geopolitical tensions, I have also identified a potential stock that could benefit from a surge despite the instability on Bitget Stock Futures. **Palantir ($PLTR)**: military data analysis and intelligence fusion. Demand typically increases during periods of heightened security alerts, especially in light of the potential risk of a U.S. intervention in Greenland and the situation in Iran ( a near-total nationwide internet blackout (around 99% disruption since January 8, confirmed by NetBlocks and cybersecurity experts), as well as widespread jamming of Starlink satellite internet using military-grade interference, with packet loss reaching up to 80% in some areas. Despite bans and active crackdowns by authorities, an estimated 50,000 smuggled terminals remain in use). However, this time I’m clearly talking about investing rather than short-term trading, which is why I’m approaching it differently. Curious to hear how others here are thinking about this: * Are gold and silver still effective hedges at these levels? * Is this a structural shift, or just a crowded trade waiting for a correction? * How (if at all) are you integrating metals into a portfolio that’s otherwise equity-heavy? Not looking for predictions, just thoughtful perspectives.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m not_usually a metals investor . I mostly stick to equities ETFs and some crypto . But given the current political and macro backdrop I ’ m starting to question whether ignoring gold and silver right now is actually the bigger risk . Gold and silver have been in a very strong uptrend over the past days and weeks . Gold is trading around $ 4675– $ 4690oz up roughly 1.8 % to 1.9 % today while silver is near $ 94oz up 5 % to 6.6 % today . Silver has been especially volatile up about 25 % YTD 2026 and roughly 200 % over the past year . From a macro perspective this looks like a classic safehaven rally driven by several overlapping factors Geopolitical tensions renewed tradewar risks US–Europe tariff threats and broader instability are pushing investors toward defensive assets . Macro uncertainty a weaker US dollar uncertainty around Fed leadership and rate cuts persistent inflation and rising global debt levels . Central bank behavior continued strong gold purchases especially from China as part of reserve diversification . Silverspecific dynamics rising industrial demand electrification AI infrastructure cryptorelated hardware structural supply deficits export restrictions and its classification as a critical mineral in the US . Some analysts Citi JPMorgan are talking about $ 5000 gold and $ 100 silver into 2026 though that obviously comes with downside risks . A pullback from profittaking seems very possible after such a sharp move even if the broader trend remains bullish . I ’ m personally conflicted . On one hand this feels late in the move . On the other if the political and macro situation deteriorates further not_having any exposure to precious metals could be a blind spot in my portfolio . I ’ m not_looking at physical metals but rather trading exposure which makes it easier to follow institutional flows and manage risk . That said I ’ m aware metals behave very differently from equities and crypto . Even crypto platforms Bitget for example now offer gold and silver trading through their TradFi products which I ’ ve already tested from a trading perspective . Execution is fast and fees are low . Given the current geopolitical tensions I have also identified a potential stock that could benefit from a surge despite the instability on Bitget Stock Futures . Palantir $ PLTR military data analysis and intelligence fusion . Demand typically increases during periods of heightened security alerts especially in light of the potential risk of a U.S. intervention in Greenland and the situation in Iran a neartotal nationwide internet blackout around 99 % disruption since January 8 confirmed by NetBlocks and cybersecurity experts as well as widespread jamming of Starlink satellite internet using militarygrade interference with packet loss reaching up to 80 % in some areas . Despite bans and active crackdowns by authorities an estimated 50000 smuggled terminals remain in use . However this time I ’ m clearly talking about investing rather than shortterm trading which is why I ’ m approaching it differently . Curious to hear how others here are thinking about this Are gold and silver still effective hedges at these levels Is this a structural shift or just a crowded trade waiting for a correction How if at all are you integrating metals into a portfolio that ’ s otherwise equityheavy Not_looking for predictions just thoughtful perspectives ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been seeing bullish thesis’s for ADBE everywhere. I get it. Adobe is a great company. But ADBE is not a great stock. Most claims I hear are “great earnings” “Growth on sale” “moat + shrinking forward PE” or similar. In his book “The Most Important Thing,” Howard Marks proposes the concept of second-level thinking, which is a more complex analysis compared to first level-thinking, which is a more superficial one. I think there’s a lot of first-level thinking on ADBE in the market right now. A lot of investor price anchoring. And a lot of fixation on accounting profit growth, instead of real compounding growth. I say this because most of the earnings growth is supported by share buybacks and not from increasing cash flow from operations. In FY 21, ADBE had 7.23 Billion in CFO, and repurchased $4.67 Billion common stock. In FY 25, adobe had $10 Billion in CFO and $12 Billion in share buybacks. So in a 5 year period, the CFO grew at 8.45% cagr, while the share buybacks grew at 26.61%. But notice that current unearned revenue increased by 0.774 B in 2025. If you do a CFO 4-year cagr that’s adjusted for cash received for services rendered, ADBE’s 4-year cash flow growth is 6.28% Why make this adjustment? Because unearned revenue is extra cash today for future liabilities. (Likely to be 2026 cash flow headwinds) Now to round out my analysis, I calculate the rough cagr of CPI inflation 2021-2025: about 6%. Net these cagr’s: 6.28-6 =0.28% Adjusted for services rendered and inflation 0.28% CFO cagr for ADBE 2021-2025- basically adobe’s CFO is moving in lockstep with inflation Earnings growth had a CAGR of 13.5% roughly, so the PE multiple improvement seems to be exclusively from inflation and buybacks. Since the rate of buyback increase can’t mathematically continue, it’s likely the metrics that justify a higher share price have negative convexity on the horizon. Overall, I’m not saying ADBE is deteriorating, but I am saying most of the reasons people give to forecast a higher share price, are based on deceivingly optimistic metrics.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys. Extremely new to stocks and Fidelity. My MIL set me up with Primerica when my great grandparents passed and put my inheritance into a Roth IRA through them. Her and her husband were doing Primerica at the time. I didn’t know anything but knew I needed a savings plan. They got out. Just found out last year they weren’t my account managers anymore after leaving. I’m pretty sure they still use Primerica services though. I don’t know anything about stocks as it is so when I found out I was obviously pissed. Made the decision to switch to Fidelity finally. I’ve been wanting to leave Primerica for quite some time because it’s so shady and you can’t control or see anything yourself really without going through someone. Anyways, now I’m with Fidelity. I had asked before on r/personalfinance what to do and I remember them telling me my money will be in stocks that are basically crap. High expense ratio funds owned by Primerica. This is what shows on my account that I own: ACGIX VAFAX SMEAX AIIEX ASIAX When I asked for advice on r/personalfinance they told me to sell what I was in and build a 3 fund portfolio. Like VTI VXUS BND or VT and BND. I honestly have no idea what to do or what most of this means. I did read about the ones I own now and they’re not good is what I’m gathering? Sorry to sound so inept on this topic. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I was going to call Fidelity and have them help me but I don’t even know what to say or ask. I also need to withdraw some of my money to pay off credit cards. Recently pregnant and going to stop working and we can’t take on the debt with one paycheck. If it helps I’m also 33 years old if this makes a difference for anything above. Thank you all. Edit: clarification",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey guys . Extremely new to stocks and Fidelity . My MIL set me up with Primerica when my great grandparents passed and put my inheritance into a Roth IRA through them . Her and her husband were doing Primerica at the time . I didn ’ t know anything but knew I needed a savings plan . They got out . Just found out last year they weren ’ t my account managers anymore after leaving . I ’ m pretty sure they still use Primerica services though . I don ’ t know anything about stocks as it is so when I found out I was obviously pissed . Made the decision to switch to Fidelity finally . I ’ ve been wanting to leave Primerica for quite some time because it ’ s so shady and you can ’ t control or see anything yourself really without going through someone . Anyways now I ’ m with Fidelity . I had asked before on rpersonalfinance what to do and I remember them telling me my money will be in stocks that are basically crap . High expense ratio funds owned by Primerica . This is what shows on my account that I own ACGIX VAFAX SMEAX AIIEX ASIAX When I asked for advice on rpersonalfinance they told me to sell what I was in and build a 3 fund portfolio . Like VTI VXUS BND or VT and BND . I honestly have no_idea what to do or what most of this means . I did read about the ones I own now and they ’ re not_good is what I ’ m gathering Sorry to sound so inept on this topic . I genuinely don ’ t know what to do .

      "selftext": "So there are thousands of strategies to invest, but focusing on just two simple examples for now. One can have VT as a one stop shop for world market. But in the future when you are doing safe withdrawals either quarterly or semi annual...is it better to have for example VOO & VXUS....then just sell which one is the better performer at the time of withdrawal? Last year international did strongly, but previous years it didn't, so due to a variety of conditions one could outperform the other. Or, does it matter, as VT technically will balance out...so you just sell the VT shares you want. This is in the context with the dollar decline / inflation driving up US stock prices, and the current administration is driving further international economic power (minus the US as they diversify away).",

Equally striking is how little markets seem to care. Despite the barrage of policy shocks, the S&P 500 has risen 3.3 per cent over the past month, while the ASX 200 has outperformed with a 3.7 per cent gain. That strength reflects Australia’s exposure to booming commodity markets, where surging gold and silver prices, along with another jump in copper, have driven solid gains for resources stocks. Are investors unusually foresighted, or simply complacent? Macquarie strategist Viktor Shvets argues it’s largely the latter, noting that investors are notoriously poor at pricing political and geopolitical risk. [ [",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, As you probably know, Jerome Powell is expected to step down from the Fed at the end of May. Over the last few months, Trump has been pushing hard for interest rate cuts, but Powell has held off, mainly because the US job market is still fairly strong and inflation remains a bit too high. Once Powell leaves, Trump will be the one appointing his replacement, and it seems reasonable to assume that a Fed chair chosen by Trump might be more open to cutting rates. Rate cuts usually make borrowing cheaper for companies, which can boost hiring and speed up economic activity, in simple terms, that’s generally good for the S&P 500. On the flip side, they also tend to push inflation higher and often weaken the dollar against the euro. Given this, do you think it makes sense to switch from a euro-denominated S&P 500 index fund to a currency-hedged one? For anyone who hasn’t really felt the impact of dollar weakness, just look at the numbers: over the last year, the S&P 500 is up about 17% in USD, but only around 4% in EUR. I'm Portuguese and that's why don't want it in dollars.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone As you probably know Jerome Powell is expected to step down from the Fed at the end of May . Over the last few months Trump has been pushing hard for interest rate cuts but Powell has held off mainly because the US job market is still fairly strong and inflation remains a bit too high . Once Powell leaves Trump will be the one appointing his replacement and it seems reasonable to assume that a Fed chair chosen by Trump might be more open to cutting rates . Rate cuts usually make borrowing cheaper for companies which can boost hiring and speed up economic activity in simple terms that ’ s generally good for the SP 500 . On the flip side they also tend to push inflation higher and often weaken the dollar against the euro . Given this do you think it makes sense to switch from a eurodenominated SP 500 index fund to a currencyhedged one For anyone who hasn ’ t really felt the impact of dollar weakness just look at the numbers over the last year the SP 500 is up about 17 % in USD but only around 4 % in EUR . Im Portuguese and thats why dont want it in dollars ."

      "title": "Volume III: Greenland & The Inevitable - Why Uranium Rare Earths and Strategic Materials Are About to Break the Market",
      "selftext": "Alright, I am back with Volume III. If you listened to me in late December, you should now be up around 45% YTD holding long. Here is my next piece as we continue to track global events and the rare earths bananza continues to take hold: —— **My portfolio (UUUU, MP, CCJ, LYC, LEU)** is not a bet on higher spot prices. It is a bet on physical bottlenecks colliding with geopolitics, energy security, and capital rotation. The market is still underestimating how violent that collision will be. The desire for Greenland is not reckless, it was inevitable. It is the visible phase of a transition that was locked in years ago…. We are entering a period where governments and utilities will pay whatever they must to secure supply of rare earths and materials. When that happens equity repricing does not happen gradually. It happens all at once. Like a fucking Hurricane. **The Macro Thesis** I. Energy security has replaced cost efficiency. II. China’s dominance is now politically intolerable. III. Supply chains cannot be rebuilt on demand. IV. Demand is inelastic and accelerating. V. Capital is rotating away from over owned growth and toward physical chokepoints. Greenland was the accelerant not the cause. The moment Greenland entered the geopolitical spotlight markets were reminded of a simple truth - just like Venezuela. **The West does not control the materials it needs to function**. That realization does not lead to negotiation. It leads to stockpiling long term contracts and panic bidding. **Why This Was Set in Stone Years Ago China Won Africa** None of this started in Greenland. Greenland is the flashpoint not the origin. The origin was a twenty year strategic campaign where China secured the physical foundation of the global economy while the West assumed markets and interdependence would enable the continuation of their growth and supremacy. Beginning in the early 2000s China made a deliberate choice. Control the inputs not the brands. While the West shut down processing, delayed permits, financialized commodities and treated minerals as cyclical trades, China invested directly in mines, built roads, ports and rail while using state backed capital for long term access to resources. **Africa was the centerpiece.** Across the DRC, Zambia, Namibia, Guinea, Zimbabwe and beyond, China locked up cobalt, copper, lithium, rare earths manganese, and graphite, not through spot markets but through multi decade offtake agreements and state to state deals the West refused to touch (because were politically correct pansies playing a game against realists who understood this mineral war years ago). Once those contracts were signed the game was over. The molecules were spoken for. China now controls the majority of rare earths. We’re fucked and now we’re panicking. **The West’s Mistake and Why It Cannot Be Fixed Quickly** 1). The West assumed supply would always be available. 2). That China would remain a neutral trade partner. 3). That ESG frameworks and markets could replace strategy. By the time policymakers woke up the supply chain had already hardened. You cannot rebuild mines in two years. You cannot rebuild processing in three. You cannot recreate workforce expertise overnight. You cannot manufacture social license on demand. China did not win because it was smarter. It won because it was earlier and planned for the long term future. **What we are watching now is not a transition. It is a forced unwind of a twenty year mistake.** Emergency funding long term contracts, ensuring strategic stockpiles and national security exemptions are all symptoms of the same realization. Time no longer exists. **Why Greenland Changed Everything** Greenland forced the issue into the open. It reminded markets and policymakers that strategic minerals are geographically constrained, that supply chains are political, and that China already made its move. This is not a new arms race. It is the late innings of one that already began. When time disappears price stops mattering. **The Companies and the Bottlenecks They Control (and how to make money from this)** This portfolio (UUUU, MP, CCJ, LYC, & LEU) is not a collection of commodity stocks. *It is a collection of chokepoint owners.* **Energy Fuels** controls one of the only domestic pathways in the United States for converting uranium into usable nuclear fuel and separating rare earth oxides. Mining without processing is irrelevant. Processing is the bottleneck. As supply nationalism accelerates Energy Fuels becomes policy infrastructure not a trade. **Cameco** sits at the center of Western uranium supply. Utilities do not want exposure to geopolitics. They want certainty. Cameco controls scalable politically acceptable supply at the exact moment utilities are pulling contracts forward and locking volumes for decades. This is not price leverage. It is contract leverage. **Centrus** controls enrichment. Mining is step one. Enrichment is the gate. SMRs require HALEU. HALEU barely exists. Russia dominates enrichment and that is no longer acceptable. Centrus is not leveraged to spot uranium. It is leveraged to national security timelines. **MP Materials** controls the only large scale rare earth mine in the United States. No mine means no supply. No supply means no EVs no defense systems no AI hardware. Processing will follow but mining is the choke. **Lynas** is the only meaningful rare earth processor outside China. That single fact makes it irreplaceable. In a real supply crisis Lynas does not compete. It gets allocated. YTD, this portfolio is up 40%. Tomorrow (and for the rest of Q1 and beyond) we should expect another major rally. **Final Thoughts** This is not a meme stock play. This is structural. A Face melting lift off based around our world changing and the minerals needed to ensure it operates. Join the ride!",

Here is my next piece as we continue to track global events and the rare earths bananza continues to take hold —— My portfolio UUUU MP CCJ LYC LEU is not_a bet on higher spot prices . It is a bet on physical bottlenecks colliding with geopolitics energy security and capital rotation . The market is still underestimating how violent that collision will be . The desire for Greenland is not_reckless it was inevitable . It is the visible phase of a transition that was locked in years ago… . We are entering a period where governments and utilities will pay whatever they must to secure supply of rare earths and materials . When that happens equity repricing does not_happen gradually . It happens all at once . Like a fucking Hurricane . The Macro Thesis I . Energy security has replaced cost efficiency . II . China ’ s dominance is now politically intolerable . III . Supply chains can not be rebuilt on demand . IV . Demand is inelastic and accelerating . V. Capital is rotating away from over owned growth and toward physical chokepoints . Greenland was the accelerant not_the cause . The moment Greenland entered the geopolitical spotlight markets were reminded of a simple truth just like Venezuela . The West does not_control the materials it needs to function . That realization does not_lead to negotiation . It leads to stockpiling long term contracts and panic bidding . Why This Was Set in Stone Years Ago China Won Africa None of this started in Greenland . Greenland is the flashpoint not_the origin . The origin was a twenty year strategic campaign where China secured the physical foundation of the global economy while the West assumed markets and interdependence would enable the continuation of their growth and supremacy . Beginning in the early 2000s China made a deliberate choice . Control the inputs not_the brands . While the West shut down processing delayed permits financialized commodities and treated minerals as cyclical trades China invested directly in mines built roads ports and rail while using state backed capital for long term access to resources . Africa was the centerpiece . Across the DRC Zambia Namibia Guinea Zimbabwe and beyond China locked up cobalt copper lithium rare earths manganese and graphite not_through spot markets but through multi decade offtake agreements and state to state deals the West refused to touch because were politically correct pansies playing a game against realists who understood this mineral war years ago . Once those contracts were signed the game was over . The molecules were spoken for . China now controls the majority of rare earths . We ’ re fucked and now we ’ re panicking . The West ’ s Mistake and Why It Can not Be Fixed Quickly 1 . The West assumed supply would always be available . 2 . That China would remain a neutral trade partner . 3 . That ESG frameworks and markets could replace strategy . By the time policymakers woke up the supply chain had already hardened . You can not rebuild mines in two years . You can not rebuild processing in three . You can not recreate workforce expertise overnight . You can not manufacture social license on demand . China did not_win because it was smarter . It won because it was earlier and planned for the long term future . What we are watching now is not_a transition . It is a forced unwind of a twenty year mistake . Emergency funding long term contracts ensuring strategic stockpiles and national security exemptions are all symptoms of the same realization . Time no_longer exists . Why Greenland Changed Everything Greenland forced the issue into the open . It reminded markets and policymakers that strategic minerals are geographically constrained that supply chains are political and that China already made its move . This is not_a new arms race . It is the late innings of one that already began . When time disappears price stops mattering . The Companies and the Bottlenecks They Control and how to make money from this This portfolio UUUU MP CCJ LYC LEU is not_a collection of commodity stocks . It is a collection of chokepoint owners . Energy Fuels controls one of the only domestic pathways in the United States for converting uranium into usable nuclear fuel and separating rare earth oxides . Mining without processing is irrelevant . Processing is the bottleneck . As supply nationalism accelerates Energy Fuels becomes policy infrastructure not_a trade . Cameco sits at the center of Western uranium supply . Utilities do not_want exposure to geopolitics . They want certainty . Cameco controls scalable politically acceptable supply at the exact moment utilities are pulling contracts forward and locking volumes for decades . This is not_price leverage . It is contract leverage . Centrus controls enrichment . Mining is step one . Enrichment is the gate . SMRs require HALEU . HALEU barely exists . Russia dominates enrichment and that is no_longer acceptable . Centrus is not_leveraged to spot uranium . It is leveraged to national security timelines . MP Materials controls the only large scale rare earth mine in the United States . No_mine means no_supply . No_supply means no_EVs no_defense systems no_AI hardware . Processing will follow but mining is the choke . Lynas is the only meaningful rare earth processor outside China . That single fact makes it irreplaceable . In a real supply crisis Lynas does not_compete . It gets allocated . YTD this portfolio is up 40 % . Tomorrow and for the rest of Q1 and beyond we should expect another major rally . Final Thoughts This is not_a meme stock play . This is structural . A Face melting lift off based around our world changing and the minerals needed to ensure it operates . Join the ride"

      "selftext": "I’m 28M and currently maxing out my Traditional 401k and fully utilizing my company's Mega Backdoor Roth (MBDR) (so $72,000 a year). I’m looking to optimize my asset location. Right now, I’m basically mirroring my allocation in both (mostly total market/S&P 500), but I’m considering if I should be more intentional about which assets sit in which tax bucket. The Question: For those with significant balances in both Traditional and Roth, how do you split your holdings? Roth priority: Do you put your highest-growth/highest-risk assets here (e.g., Small Cap Value, Emerging Markets) to maximize tax-free growth? Traditional priority: Do you keep the \"steadier\" stuff here (e.g., S&P 500, Bonds) to mitigate the future tax bill? Or do you just keep the same allocation across all accounts for simplicity? My current thoughts: I'm leaning toward putting my Small Cap tilt in the Roth side and keeping the core S&P 500 in Traditional. I have a 30+ year horizon, so I want to be aggressive, but I’m curious if I'm overthinking the \"tax drag\" vs. the simplicity of mirroring. What’s your strategy and why?",

Mortgage prepayment reducing the monthly payment 2. Mortgage prepayment reducing the remaining term 3. Investing the €25,000 long-term (index funds / ETFs / stocks) over \\~23 years I already invest in an **S&P 500 ETF**, and I believe adding MSCI World would be somewhat redundant due to heavy US exposure (please correct me if I’m wrong). 👉 Main questions: * Does it make sense to prepay a mortgage at a relatively low interest rate like 2.65%? * If investing instead, which assets would best complement an S&P 500 position? * Would you split the €25,000 between mortgage prepayment and investing? If so, how? Profile: long-term horizon, medium–high risk tolerance, no short-term liquidity needs. Thanks in advance!",

Investing the €25000 longterm index funds ETFs stocks over 23 years I already invest in an SP 500 ETF and I believe adding MSCI World would be somewhat redundant due to heavy US exposure please correct me if I ’ m wrong . 👉 Main questions Does it make sense to prepay a mortgage at a relatively low interest rate like 2.65 % If investing instead which assets would best complement an SP 500 position Would you split the €25000 between mortgage prepayment and investing If so how Profile longterm horizon medium–high risk tolerance no_shortterm liquidity needs . Thanks in advance"

      "selftext": "Everyone seems to know feel that valuations are high. J.P. Morgan recently released data showing that when the S&P 500 trades at forward P/E ratios around 22x (where we are now), subsequent 10-year returns have historically ranged between +2% and -2%. For example -> Japan in 1989 was unstoppable and from a period of 15 years (1974 to 1989), the Nikkei 225 had gone up over 10x from 3600 to over 36,000. Then had 30 years of a rollercoaster after 1990 before crossing 36,000 again in 2023. What nobody seems to talk about is what we're supposed to *do* about it. Going through it, the standard options have problems: * **Treasuries**: 4-5% nominal, maybe 1-2% real adjusted for inflation. And then you have to time your re-entry. * **Gold**: Crushed it from 2000-2010 (+15% CAGR) while the S&P was flat (and now). But from 1980-1999, gold returned -6.5% annualized while stocks did +13%. * **International**: \"Cheaper\" for a decade now, but anyone who diversified has underperformed unless they did it last year. Classically it seems like most people take the route of doing nothing. Historically includes a lot of people who waited 10-30 years. The S&P 500 has done something similar in the last 16 years. Going from a low of 677 on March 2009 to 6900+ today in Jan 2026. Also 10x growth within a similar time period. Obviously a lot of what everyone is scared about is the AI bubble. Meanwhile in Japan back in 1989 I looked it up on Reddit and [anecdotes from that time make it sound more insane]( P/E ratios back then were also 60 to 80 for companies. So basically 10 to 30 years of bad returns is not unprecedented. Still Japan at least had deflation / low inflation. I'm curious on how everyone is thinking about potentially hedging.",

Morgan recently released data showing that when the SP 500 trades at forward PE ratios around 22x where we are now subsequent 10year returns have historically ranged between 2 % and 2 % . For example Japan in 1989 was unstoppable and from a period of 15 years 1974 to 1989 the Nikkei 225 had gone up over 10x from 3600 to over 36000 . Then had 30 years of a rollercoaster after 1990 before crossing 36000 again in 2023 . What nobody_seems to talk about is what were supposed to do about it . Going through it the standard options have problems Treasuries 45 % nominal maybe 12 % real adjusted for inflation . And then you have to time your reentry . Gold Crushed it from 20002010 15 % CAGR while the SP was flat and now . But from 19801999 gold returned 6.5 % annualized while stocks did 13 % . International Cheaper for a decade now but anyone who diversified has underperformed unless they did it last year . Classically it seems like most people take the route of doing nothing_Historically includes a lot of people who waited 1030 years . The SP 500 has done something similar in the last 16 years . Going from a low of 677 on March 2009 to 6900 today in Jan 2026 . Also 10x growth within a similar time period . Obviously a lot of what everyone is scared about is the AI bubble . Meanwhile in Japan back in 1989 I looked it up on Reddit and anecdotes from that time make it sound more insane PE ratios back then were also 60 to 80 for companies . So basically 10 to 30 years of bad returns is not_unprecedented . Still Japan at least had deflation low inflation . Im curious on how everyone is thinking about potentially hedging ."

They’re still at the core of Celestial AI which was just bought by Marvell for $5 billion in agreement to supply to Amazon. They have about a dozen customers, including Foxconn, NTT, Luxshare, Adtran, and they have “a few other \\*large\\* customers… we will announce when the time is right with those customers.\" Photonics will be utilized in so many global industries, just look into Poet’s patents and development roadmap, this is the future. 🌌✨🌌 Positions: $9c 4/17, $10c and $12c Jan2027, and shares",

      "title": "The Greenland Rug Pull: Nuking the Markets for a Glacier",
      "selftext": "If the administration actually gets to a place where Greenland is up for purchase, how do you all think the markets will react? **1)** They will have to finance this thing somehow. Obviously, they can't just issue pure US debt given the political liability around the debt quantum. Bessent has signaled they could go the path of using a Sovereign Wealth Fund to finance the transaction, likely by stuffing student loans, federal land rights, or other assets and securitizing them out to investors via \"Greenland bonds.\" **2)** Those bonds will have to trade higher than standard US debt given the risk premium and novelty of the structuring (not to mention the depth of the market). Selling, say, $1-2T of these new instruments would flood the market with higher rate debt, driving prices of existing, lower-rate bond portfolios down right off the bat. There goes the bond market. **3)** The higher rates would lead to crowding out, as large institutional investors decide that holding high-rate bonds with a (basically) guaranteed return is worth more than holding equities with less certain returns. Institutional investors would sell off equities to buy larger bond portfolios (this would offset the impact of #2, but not on a 1:1 basis). Equity markets would fall as a result. **4)** The fact that these new pseudo-government bonds would be issued at a higher rate effectively increases the 'risk-free,' i.e., discount rate of the overall economy. If you were evaluating an equity's fundamental value, this increased discount rate would result in the equity being worth less than before. This is a second factor that would push the equity markets down, combined with #3. >**4.1)** The Fed could step in here and perform QE to cap rates, but in any case, this is akin to the US printing money to fund the purchase of Greenland as opposed to financing it. This would just hyper-charge the next point as the Fed creates new money to buy the excess bonds. **5)** Once the funds are raised and the government actually sends out the cash to Denmark/Greenland, it's effectively injected the global economy with $1-2T of debt, strongly raising the likelihood of inflation. Remember it's also pledged what were previously government cash flows to investors (student loans, land rights, etc.), which will create a cash flow hole for the US government that will need to be filled with either taxes, budget cuts, or everyone's favorite, more debt - i.e., more inflation, higher debt-to-GDP ratio, higher rates, and more equity (and likely bond market) depression. >**5.1)** A small, nuanced point, but the way the US will likely need to structure these bonds to make them marketable to investors will require them to retain an equity tranche in the securitization vehicle, which, if priced incorrectly would essentially 'create money,' also driving up money supply and possibly long-term inflation. **6)** Higher rates, greater inflation, and depressed equity/bond markets leaves one trade left for investors, i.e. a debasement trade in hard assets like gold/silver. Of course, gold/silver might crash at first as investors flock to the dollar/sell off for cash (won't get into emerging market dynamics here, but you can guess), but eventually the inflationary effects will get priced in and drive demand for the assets. **Takeaway)** This is highly speculative, and the future is anything but predictable. But the truth is that the US probably doesn't have the firepower to finance this thing, and the fact that any ROI on Greenland would take years to manifest implies there's no way out of buying the island without jacking up rates and inflation (which itself jacks up rates). I think the winning strategy here is all about timing a buy and sell, likely staying out of the capital markets until it becomes apparent that inflation is being priced in, at which point bond markets will have corrected and hard assets like gold/silver should begin to climb. High rates risk Fed action, and even if the Fed does bring rates down, any subsequent QE-induced inflation stands to depress bond/equity valuations in this type of environment. >**Note 1)** I do think a lot of this hinges on the ROI of buying Greenland. If it turns out that the Island can pay for the debt and generate excess returns in a timely manner, i.e., essentially immediately, then perhaps there is no excess inflation from the US printing debt to cap rates/covering cash-flow holes. I do think, though, regardless, the effect of issuing high-rate bonds to pull cash-flows forward and injecting the global economy with that capital has the capacity to trigger this general flow of events. Plus, and ROI from Greenland would take decades, well after the inflation has sunk in. >**Note 2)** There is the possibility that the political crisis this has/will cause a deterioration in trade between the EU and the US, which might limit the effects of a capital injection into the EU on the US economy - but their interlinkage is so strong, I doubt there can ever be a true wall keeping inflation east of the Atlantic.",

      "selftext_processed": "If the administration actually gets to a place where Greenland is up for purchase how do you all think the markets will react 1 They will have to finance this thing somehow . Obviously they cant just issue pure US debt given the political liability around the debt quantum . Bessent has signaled they could go the path of using a Sovereign Wealth Fund to finance the transaction likely by stuffing student loans federal land rights or other assets and securitizing them out to investors via Greenland bonds . 2 Those bonds will have to trade higher than standard US debt given the risk premium and novelty of the structuring not to mention the depth of the market . Selling say $ 12T of these new instruments would flood the market with higher rate debt driving prices of existing lowerrate bond portfolios down right off the bat . There goes the bond market . 3 The higher rates would lead to crowding out as large institutional investors decide that holding highrate bonds with a basically guaranteed return is worth more than holding equities with less certain returns . Institutional investors would sell off equities to buy larger bond portfolios this would offset the impact of 2 but not_on a 11 basis . Equity markets would fall as a result . 4 The fact that these new pseudogovernment bonds would be issued at a higher rate effectively increases the riskfree i.e . discount rate of the overall economy . If you were evaluating an equitys fundamental value this increased discount rate would result in the equity being worth less than before . This is a second factor that would push the equity markets down combined with 3 . 4.1 The Fed could step in here and perform QE to cap rates but in any case this is akin to the US printing money to fund the purchase of Greenland as opposed to financing it . This would just hypercharge the next point as the Fed creates new money to buy the excess bonds . 5 Once the funds are raised and the government actually sends out the cash to DenmarkGreenland its effectively injected the global economy with $ 12T of debt strongly raising the likelihood of inflation . Remember its also pledged what were previously government cash flows to investors student loans land rights etc . which will create a cash flow hole for the US government that will need to be filled with either taxes budget cuts or everyones favorite more debt i.e . more inflation higher debttoGDP ratio higher rates and more equity and likely bond market depression . 5.1 A small nuanced point but the way the US will likely need to structure these bonds to make them marketable to investors will require them to retain an equity tranche in the securitization vehicle which if priced incorrectly would essentially create money also driving up money supply and possibly longterm inflation . 6 Higher rates greater inflation and depressed equitybond markets leaves one trade left for investors i.e . a debasement trade in hard assets like goldsilver . Of course goldsilver might crash at first as investors flock to the dollarsell off for cash wont get into emerging market dynamics here but you can guess but eventually the inflationary effects will get priced in and drive demand for the assets . Takeaway This is highly speculative and the future is anything but predictable . But the truth is that the US probably doesnt have the firepower to finance this thing and the fact that any ROI on Greenland would take years to manifest implies theres no_way out of buying the island without jacking up rates and inflation which itself jacks up rates . I think the winning strategy here is all about timing a buy and sell likely staying out of the capital markets until it becomes apparent that inflation is being priced in at which point bond markets will have corrected and hard assets like goldsilver should begin to climb . High rates risk Fed action and even if the Fed does bring rates down any subsequent QEinduced inflation stands to depress bondequity valuations in this type of environment . Note 1 I do think a lot of this hinges on the ROI of buying Greenland . If it turns out that the Island can pay for the debt and generate excess returns in a timely manner i.e . essentially immediately then perhaps there is no_excess inflation from the US printing debt to cap ratescovering cashflow holes . I do think though regardless the effect of issuing highrate bonds to pull cashflows forward and injecting the global economy with that capital has the capacity to trigger this general flow of events . Plus and ROI from Greenland would take decades well after the inflation has sunk in . Note 2 There is the possibility that the political crisis this haswill cause a deterioration in trade between the EU and the US which might limit the effects of a capital injection into the EU on the US economy but their interlinkage is so strong I doubt there can ever be a true wall keeping inflation east of the Atlantic ."

I prefer IT’s because they are low maintenance, virtually guarantee passive income in both good times and bad times, can be traded as easily as individual stocks and often trade below NAV (at a discount). Is it better to cherry pick your own stocks in up to 30 companies? Are the IT fees so high it makes them a less cost effective investment? Are junk bonds paying 10% interest just better? Overall I prefer IT’s and building them up for passive income during both my working life and retirement.",

And I have been doing well with that. The thing is though: if the US would indeed invade Greenland, it will definitely have devastating consequences on the American economy and Europe would essentially ban American companies from operating in Europe. So I am looking into how I can de-risk my portfolio - happy to hear your opinions on that. Update: Thank you everyone who made reasonable suggestions, it gave me lots of valuable info and there are a few things I will take action on. I have always been one of those \"ride it out\" people, never panicked, always held my stuff and it always paid out in the long run (like for example being up 500% on Alphabet or 1200% on Apple). But I think that IF something happens this time, it will be different. Because it would be a US centered, self-inflicted desaster of the US economy. Yes, it would also hurt the rest of the economy world-wide, but the trust in the US as reliable partner would be gone for decades.",

And I have been doing well with that . The thing is though if the US would indeed invade Greenland it will definitely have devastating consequences on the American economy and Europe would essentially ban American companies from operating in Europe . So I am looking into how I can derisk my portfolio happy to hear your opinions on that . Update Thank you everyone who made reasonable suggestions it gave me lots of valuable info and there are a few things I will take action on . I have always been one of those ride it out people never_panicked always held my stuff and it always paid out in the long run like for example being up 500 % on Alphabet or 1200 % on Apple . But I think that IF something happens this time it will be different . Because it would be a US centered selfinflicted desaster of the US economy . Yes it would also hurt the rest of the economy worldwide but the trust in the US as reliable partner would be gone for decades ."

      "selftext": "&#x200B; Market Cap : 60 Billion Shares Outstanding : 150million Reason 1: Ai Data center and robotics We have a stock which is directly tied to the current market trend of AI Data centers. The current trend is that there is crazy shortages in Memory chips, and Sandisk is one of the companies that creates them. Everything from Robots, cars, data centers all need memory chips to store data. Reason 2: Google Search Trends: Google trends for SNDK worldwide for the last 90 days havent peaked, while the share price is making all time highs DAILY. Even during red market days this shit is barely red or even green. This NEVER happens to pump and dumps. Shitty pump and dumps crash the moment searches on Google drop. look at the graph yourself and compare it to any other pump and dumps you know of. It is also still less popular than the most popular stocks. I can't post links but just search up \"Google Trends\", type in SNDK and put worldwide, 90 days. Reason 3: YouTube streamers and Financial Influencers Search for SNDK on youtube. No hyped up videos from streamers, youtube influencers yet the stock is up 1000%... I get it, its already up so much. So then where are all the reddit ai bots and videos trying to hype it up? Whenever you see those bots trying to pump up the stock, thats your cue to sell yesterday. For SNDK, there's none of that so far. This makes me believe that it was all institutions quietly buying it at first, before all the retail traders. Reason 4: Analyst Price Targets You'll never see analyst price targets for shitty pump and dumps. Most updated price targets from investing firms: Mizuho: $410 when the stock was only at $300 Bernstein: $580 when it was trading at $350 RBC Capital: $400 when it was at $380 Mizuho: $700Billion in Assets under management Bernstein: $900Billion in Assets under management BC Capital: $1 Trillion in Assets under Management. These are serious predictions, not some guys in a mom's basement Reason 5: It is TINY compared to other companies 150m shares outstanding means it can move FAST compared to many other companies in the sector Micron (MU) 1.1Billion shares. Market Cap: 380Billion ASTS: 280 million shares Nvidia (NVDA) 24 Billion Shares, Market Cap: 4.5T SNDK? 150million and 60Billion Market cap. Absolutely tiny compared. Reason 6: Extended Momentum Just look at the graph, this has been pumping forever. Not 1 or 2 days, Or weeks, or months. its been pumping since IPO. That is all, good luck Positions: Feb 27 500c",

I’ve been getting emails about them changing the margin rates to 5% or lower just depends how much margin you use. It sounds like a good deal just use margin to invest in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq and low risk ETFs and you’ll outperform it in the long run. And a bunch of people are saying margin is risky and you shouldn’t use it. I plan on using like 20-25% of the available margin to invest in ETFs because I’ll have cash on the side just in case there’s a bear market and I know there’s a chance to get margin call. Am I missing something that I should be aware of why this is a bad deal?",

      "title": "History of US equities, t-bills, treasuries, gold, and international returns",
      "selftext": "In a recent thread on r/ETFs, I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international (and other asset classes) from Testfolio. In brief, US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents, both on a nominal and an excess (above risk-free rate) basis, a phenomenon known as [\"the presidential puzzle\"]( However, correlation is not causation, and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of time-varying risk aversion. # Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests. Details for the data sources are [documented](#backtest): * SPYSIM: Mimics S&P 500. Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928, then Schwert S&P 500 composite portfolio through 1962, then S&P 500 price index through 1993, then SPY thereafter. * VTISIM: Total US stock market, based on Fama-French dataset from 1926-1992, then investible mutual funds/ETFs afterwards * VXUSSIM: International ex-US stock market, based on MSCI World ex-USA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996, then investible mutual funds afterwards. * VTSIM: Global. VTISIM/VXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008, then VT afterwards. * GLDSIM: Spot gold, based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004, then GLD afterwards. * TBILL: Fama-French Rf from 1926-1954, then 3-month T-bill rate thereafter. * IEFSIM: 10-year US treasury rate from 1962-2002, then IEF thereafter. * INFLATION: Unadjusted CPI-U. Additionally, to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent, I \"staggered\" the investment period by starting and ending it on \"Inauguration Day\" rather than \"New Year's Day\". Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937; prior to 1937, Inauguration Day was March 4, and this is reflected accordingly in the \"staggered years\". As such, 1973 refers to the period from 1973-01-20 to 1974-01-20. (Note also that this does not double-count January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio \"invests\" at the close of the starting day for each period.) A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post. # US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities, \"cash\" (risk-free treasuries), and inflation going back to 1926, with the Fama-French Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1926-present)|99.56|\\+10.28%|\\+10.23%|\\+3.33%|\\+2.95%| |Republican|47.68|\\+6.58%|\\+6.33%|\\+4.34%|\\+2.22%| |Democratic|51.88|\\+13.80%|\\+13.95%|\\+2.42%|\\+3.63%| |Post-Depression (1940-present)|86.00|\\+11.49%|\\+11.47%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.71%| |Republican|41.00|\\+9.07%|\\+8.96%|\\+4.69%|\\+3.43%| |Democratic|45.00|\\+13.74%|\\+13.81%|\\+2.77%|\\+3.97%| Going back to 1926, US equities (+10.28% p.a.) did better under Democratic presidencies (+13.80%) than under Republican ones (+6.58%). However, it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies (+3.63%) than under Republican ones (+2.22%), cash (or short-term treasury bills) paid less (+2.42%) under Democrats than under Republicans (+4.34%). We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression--a terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership, but also a very deflationary one, with subsequent rebound under FDR--by starting our timeline in 1940. In this case, US equities still did better under Democrats (+13.74%) than Republicans (+9.07%), but the inflation gap (+3.97% vs. 3.43%) is closer; short-term treasury bills still paid less under Democrats (+2.77% vs. 4.69%). Regardless of which party was in office, you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal, real, and risk-free premium basis. That is, US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above risk-free treasury bills. # US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962, we have access to IEFSIM, which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002, and then on the IEF ETF (7-10 year treasuries) thereafter. This provides a real investment alternative to cash/t-bills. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1962-present)|64.05|\\+10.52%|\\+10.58%|\\+4.52%|\\+6.01%|\\+3.77%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|31.05|\\+13.78%|\\+14.06%|\\+3.72%|\\+2.98%|\\+3.60%| During this time, US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents (+14.06% vs. +7.39%). Inflation was similar, slightly lower under Democrats (+3.60% vs. +3.92%). Treasuries paid higher under Republicans (+8.94% vs. +2.98%), which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis. In fact, US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents (+8.94% vs. +7.39%). # US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold, which has gained in popularity with its recent surge. This is a useful separate gauge because on balance short-term interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans, both on a nominal and real basis. However, gold provides a \"benchmark\" that is not directly affected by central bank policy. Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard, the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968; Testfolio has data starting on 1968-04-01. Additionally, the US did not formally break from the gold standard until Nixon's announcement on 1971-08-15 marked the end of Bretton Woods. Both timelines are represented here: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1968-present)|57.80|\\+10.81%|\\+10.81%|\\+8.30%|\\+4.58%|\\+6.38%|\\+3.94%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+8.19%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|24.80|\\+15.32%|\\+15.52%|\\+8.44%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.07%|\\+3.97%| |After Bretton Woods (1971-present)|54.43|\\+11.16%|\\+11.17%|\\+8.72%|\\+4.50%|\\+6.49%|\\+3.86%| |Republican|30.43|\\+8.00%|\\+7.98%|\\+9.11%|\\+5.19%|\\+9.23%|\\+3.79%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| This period was also characterized by better equity performance under Democratic presidents (+15.52% vs. +7.39%), with similar levels of inflation (+3.97% D vs. +3.92% R). Gold also performed similarly (+8.44% D vs. +8.19% R) regardless of political party in office. However, US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats (+15.52% vs. +8.44%), but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans (+7.39% vs. +8.19%). A similar (but more pronounced) trend can be seen if using the post-Bretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold. # US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international (ex-US) equities. This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy, because when the FOMC cuts, all else being equal, the dollar weakens relative to other currencies, thereby boosting USD-denominated international returns (and vice versa). Unfortunately, we do not have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices, which initially tracked only developed (MSCI World) markets: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|International|Global|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1970-present)|56.05|\\+11.07%|\\+11.05%|\\+8.88%|\\+10.03%|\\+8.84%|\\+4.54%|\\+6.66%|\\+3.89%| |Republican|32.05|\\+8.01%|\\+7.94%|\\+8.17%|\\+8.05%|\\+9.31%|\\+5.22%|\\+9.39%|\\+3.85%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+9.84%|\\+12.74%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| In 55 years of available data, US equities soundly outperformed international (+11.05% vs. +8.88%). However, outperformance came during Democratic presidencies (+15.35% vs. +9.84%); under Republican presidents, US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts (+7.94% vs. +8.17%). I want to emphasize these do not constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international (and certainly not to pull all your stocks out of the market). Past performance is not an indication of future performance. It is as nonsensical to say \"the US always underperforms under X\" as is to say \"the US will always outperform international\". # Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio. Because these are limited to five \"portfolios\" per backtest, for each year, I've put S&P 500, US, Cash, Treasuries, and Inflation in the \"US\" link and international, global, and gold in the \"gold\" or \"intl\" link. Note that these reflective \"cumulative\" returns for each period. All of these are one year periods with the exception of the following: * 1926: 1926-06-30 to 1927-03-04 due to start of data series * 1936: 1936-03-04 to 1937-01-20 due to change in Inauguration Day (20th Amendment) * 2025: 2025-01-20 to 2026-01-16 (current) * 1961, 1968, 1969: Returns for treasuries^†, gold^‡, and international^§ are based on start of data series as indicated in foot notes below. Note that for the sections above, the \"other\" asset classes are aligned to the same date (i.e. US stock returns for \"After Bretton Woods\" started on 1971-08-15), even though these are not shown in the table below. |Year^\\*|Party|President|S&P|US|Intl|Global|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1926 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|10.19%|13.80%||||1.87%||\\-1.77%| |1927 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|22.85%|26.36%||||2.61%||\\-1.65%| |1928 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|50.86%|46.26%||||3.17%||\\-0.08%| |1929 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-4.14%|\\-10.52%||||3.83%||\\-0.59%| |1930 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-22.54%|\\-26.01%||||1.80%||\\-7.65%| |1931 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-45.92%|\\-46.70%||||1.10%||\\-10.20%| |1932 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-27.51%|\\-25.74%||||0.35%||\\-9.92%| |1933 ([US](|Dem|F.

      "selftext_processed": "In a recent thread on rETFs I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international and other asset classes from Testfolio . In brief US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents both on a nominal and an excess above riskfree rate basis a phenomenon known as the presidential puzzle However correlation is not_causation and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of timevarying risk aversion . Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests . Details for the data sources are documentedbacktest SPYSIM Mimics SP 500 . Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928 then Schwert SP 500 composite portfolio through 1962 then SP 500 price index through 1993 then SPY thereafter . VTISIM Total US stock market based on FamaFrench dataset from 19261992 then investible mutual fundsETFs afterwards VXUSSIM International exUS stock market based on MSCI World exUSA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996 then investible mutual funds afterwards . VTSIM Global . VTISIMVXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008 then VT afterwards . GLDSIM Spot gold based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004 then GLD afterwards . TBILL FamaFrench Rf from 19261954 then 3month Tbill rate thereafter . IEFSIM 10year US treasury rate from 19622002 then IEF thereafter . INFLATION Unadjusted CPIU . Additionally to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent I staggered the investment period by starting and ending it on Inauguration Day rather than New Years Day . Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937 prior to 1937 Inauguration Day was March 4 and this is reflected accordingly in the staggered years . As such 1973 refers to the period from 19730120 to 19740120 . Note also that this does not_doublecount January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio invests at the close of the starting day for each period . A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post . US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities cash riskfree treasuries and inflation going back to 1926 with the FamaFrench Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashInflation Overall 1926present99.5610.28 % 10.23 % 3.33 % 2.95 % Republican47.686.58 % 6.33 % 4.34 % 2.22 % Democratic51.8813.80 % 13.95 % 2.42 % 3.63 % PostDepression 1940present86.0011.49 % 11.47 % 3.68 % 3.71 % Republican41.009.07 % 8.96 % 4.69 % 3.43 % Democratic45.0013.74 % 13.81 % 2.77 % 3.97 % Going back to 1926 US equities 10.28 % p.a . did better under Democratic presidencies 13.80 % than under Republican ones 6.58 % . However it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies 3.63 % than under Republican ones 2.22 % cash or shortterm treasury bills paid less 2.42 % under Democrats than under Republicans 4.34 % . We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depressiona terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership but also a very deflationary one with subsequent rebound under FDRby starting our timeline in 1940 . In this case US equities still did better under Democrats 13.74 % than Republicans 9.07 % but the inflation gap 3.97 % vs. 3.43 % is closer shortterm treasury bills still paid less under Democrats 2.77 % vs. 4.69 % . Regardless of which party was in office you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal real and riskfree premium basis . That is US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above riskfree treasury bills . US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962 we have access to IEFSIM which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002 and then on the IEF ETF 710 year treasuries thereafter . This provides a real investment alternative to cashtbills . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1962present64.0510.52 % 10.58 % 4.52 % 6.01 % 3.77 % Republican33.007.54 % 7.39 % 5.27 % 8.94 % 3.92 % Democratic31.0513.78 % 14.06 % 3.72 % 2.98 % 3.60 % During this time US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents 14.06 % vs. 7.39 % . Inflation was similar slightly lower under Democrats 3.60 % vs. 3.92 % . Treasuries paid higher under Republicans 8.94 % vs. 2.98 % which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis . In fact US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents 8.94 % vs. 7.39 % . US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold which has gained in popularity with its recent surge . This is a useful separate gauge because on balance shortterm interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans both on a nominal and real basis . However gold provides a benchmark that is not_directly affected by central bank policy . Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968 Testfolio has data starting on 19680401 . Additionally the US did not_formally break from the gold standard until Nixons announcement on 19710815 marked the end of Bretton Woods . Both timelines are represented here CAGRYearsSP 500USGoldCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1968present57.8010.81 % 10.81 % 8.30 % 4.58 % 6.38 % 3.94 % Republican33.007.54 % 7.39 % 8.19 % 5.27 % 8.94 % 3.92 % Democratic24.8015.32 % 15.52 % 8.44 % 3.68 % 3.07 % 3.97 % After Bretton Woods 1971present54.4311.16 % 11.17 % 8.72 % 4.50 % 6.49 % 3.86 % Republican30.438.00 % 7.98 % 9.11 % 5.19 % 9.23 % 3.79 % Democratic24.0015.31 % 15.35 % 8.23 % 3.64 % 3.11 % 3.94 % This period was also characterized by better equity performance under Democratic presidents 15.52 % vs. 7.39 % with similar levels of inflation 3.97 % D vs. 3.92 % R. Gold also performed similarly 8.44 % D vs. 8.19 % R regardless of political party in office . However US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats 15.52 % vs. 8.44 % but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans 7.39 % vs. 8.19 % . A similar but more pronounced trend can be seen if using the postBretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold . US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international exUS equities . This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy because when the FOMC cuts all else being equal the dollar weakens relative to other currencies thereby boosting USDdenominated international returns and vice versa . Unfortunately we do not_have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices which initially tracked only developed MSCI World markets CAGRYearsSP 500USInternationalGlobalGoldCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1970present56.0511.07 % 11.05 % 8.88 % 10.03 % 8.84 % 4.54 % 6.66 % 3.89 % Republican32.058.01 % 7.94 % 8.17 % 8.05 % 9.31 % 5.22 % 9.39 % 3.85 % Democratic24.0015.31 % 15.35 % 9.84 % 12.74 % 8.23 % 3.64 % 3.11 % 3.94 % In 55 years of available data US equities soundly outperformed international 11.05 % vs. 8.88 % . However outperformance came during Democratic presidencies 15.35 % vs. 9.84 % under Republican presidents US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts 7.94 % vs. 8.17 % . I want to emphasize these do not_constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international and certainly not_to pull all your stocks out of the market . Past performance is not_an indication of future performance . It is as nonsensical to say the US always underperforms under X as is to say the US will always outperform international . Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio . Because these are limited to five portfolios per backtest for each year Ive put SP 500 US Cash Treasuries and Inflation in the US link and international global and gold in the gold or intl link .

All of these are one year periods with the exception of the following 1926 19260630 to 19270304 due to start of data series 1936 19360304 to 19370120 due to change in Inauguration Day 20th Amendment 2025 20250120 to 20260116 current 1961 1968 1969 Returns for treasuries† gold‡ and international§ are based on start of data series as indicated in foot notes below .

The account has $14000 in it but has been sitting for three years (since I got a new job) and Vanguard has since changed it to a Money Market account. I actively contribute to my 401K so this is not my only retirement account, but both my wife and I have our 401Ks through Fidelity. What is the best way to reinvest this money instead of just letting it sit? Just dump it into a targeted retirement? I’m not huge into investing (obviously) besides contributing to 401Ks, so I don’t really want to babysit it.",

I saw that Schwab rates specific sectors outlooks monthly. For example, for January 2026, Communication Services, Health Care, and Industrials are all rated to outperform vs the SP500. They also list a few rated to underperform. It would be easy enough to keep your \"SP500\" investment strategy account slightly overweight in those sectors by buying some sector specific ETFs in those sectors rated to outperform. Does anybody do this? If so, how much extra do you put in sectors you hope will outperform the SP500? This is the link to the Schwab webpage that presents their sector ratings.

      "selftext": "With openAI announcing they’re about to start shoving ads into chatgpt there’s gonna be some takes about it being the end of Googles ad business or metas ad revenue, so let’s just sense check that with some numbers. Chat GPT is definitely a consumer juggernaut, at last count has something like 900 million users (give or take) but only a small single digit percentage of those are paying. Ads will be served to the rest. Ad business take serious time to scale. Example, Amazon started offering them around 2017 and by 2020 they only generated $20b in sales for them. Which isn’t small, but it is the context of a trillion dollar company (which Amazon is and which OpenAI is trying to be). Amazons ad business is now $56b per year (2024 figures) so there’s potential there but again, it takes time. As for Meta, they’ll probably be fine. They did $50b in ad revenue too. Only difference? It was in a single quarter not a year. If I had to guess in 5 years time I’d say that one of the LLMs will take a chunk of ad revenue out of the market so that global ad spend will be split differently m, but there’s no good way to figure out who that might be yet (e.g. only 6 months ago Google was the main loser in the AI race, now it’s everyone’s consensus winner).",

Chat GPT is definitely a consumer juggernaut at last count has something like 900 million users give or take but only a small single digit percentage of those are paying . Ads will be served to the rest . Ad business take serious time to scale . Example Amazon started offering them around 2017 and by 2020 they only generated $ 20b in sales for them . Which isn ’ t small but it is the context of a trillion dollar company which Amazon is and which OpenAI is trying to be . Amazons ad business is now $ 56b per year 2024 figures so there ’ s potential there but again it takes time . As for Meta they ’ ll probably be fine . They did $ 50b in ad revenue too . Only difference It was in a single quarter not_a year . If I had to guess in 5 years time I ’ d say that one of the LLMs will take a chunk of ad revenue out of the market so that global ad spend will be split differently m but there ’ s no_good way to figure out who that might be yet e.g . only 6 months ago Google was the main loser in the AI race now it ’ s everyone ’ s consensus winner ."

      "title": "Question re: Roth IRA Transfer and Roth Swap",
      "selftext": "My wife recently transferred her Roth IRA from NW Mutual to a Schwab Roth IRA to avoid certain fees and give her more control over her investments, among other reasons that are irrelevant to this question. Her transferred Roth IRA from NW Mutual consisted of about $50K worth of shares from one mutual fund. Upon completing the Roth IRA transfer from NW Mutual to the Schwab Roth IRA, she tried to purchase some of those same mutual fund shares, but we learned that \"buy orders are not currently being accepted on this fund\" within Schwab. I'm thinking she should have sold her shares through NW Mutual, transferred the cash to Schwab, and then re-purchased through Schwab. Option 1 (this seems to be the worst option). Can my wife sell all of these shares within Schwab and re-allocate that cash to a separate but tradeable stock through her Schwab Roth IRA? Though, if buy orders aren't being accepted through Schwab on this mutual fund, I'm not sure selling these mutual fund shares through Schwab is even an option. Hence my above conclusion that she should have sold through NW Mutual before transferring the Roth IRA cash to Schwab. Also, I believe triggering this Option 1 would create issues surrounding the amount she can contribute in a single year, in addition to tax consequences. OR Option 2. There is a \"swap funds\" feature that I need to investigate and better understand, which seems to be the right way to go about this, or at least the better option. But again, if \"buy orders are not being accepted\" - I'm not sure that's possible under the \"swap.\" Granted, we'd be \"swapping\" which may be allowed and considered a different transaction all together. I presume it would be best to \"swap.\" Though, I'm not sure she can swap portions of the mutual fund into multiple new investments, for instance 50% into a different mutual fund and 50% into an equity/stock. All this said - I should probably just talk to a Schwab representative or a financial professional. Though, any preliminary understanding I can gain here is most appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "My wife recently transferred her Roth IRA from NW Mutual to a Schwab Roth IRA to avoid certain fees and give her more control over her investments among other reasons that are irrelevant to this question . Her transferred Roth IRA from NW Mutual consisted of about $ 50K worth of shares from one mutual fund . Upon completing the Roth IRA transfer from NW Mutual to the Schwab Roth IRA she tried to purchase some of those same mutual fund shares but we learned that buy orders are not_currently being accepted on this fund within Schwab . Im thinking she should have sold her shares through NW Mutual transferred the cash to Schwab and then repurchased through Schwab . Option 1 this seems to be the worst option . Can my wife sell all of these shares within Schwab and reallocate that cash to a separate but tradeable stock through her Schwab Roth IRA Though if buy orders arent being accepted through Schwab on this mutual fund Im not_sure selling these mutual fund shares through Schwab is even an option . Hence my above conclusion that she should have sold through NW Mutual before transferring the Roth IRA cash to Schwab . Also I believe triggering this Option 1 would create issues surrounding the amount she can contribute in a single year in addition to tax consequences . OR Option 2 . There is a swap funds feature that I need to investigate and better understand which seems to be the right way to go about this or at least the better option . But again if buy orders are not_being accepted Im not_sure thats possible under the swap . Granted wed be swapping which may be allowed and considered a different transaction all together . I presume it would be best to swap . Though Im not_sure she can swap portions of the mutual fund into multiple new investments for instance 50 % into a different mutual fund and 50 % into an equitystock . All this said I should probably just talk to a Schwab representative or a financial professional . Though any preliminary understanding I can gain here is most appreciated ."

If that diamond-handed maniac held his shares like he promised (he said he was holding for 10 years), his $700k \"disaster\" is now worth over **$1.1 Million**. Nana isn’t rolling in her grave anymore; she’s popping bottles in Valhalla. The \"National Champion\" is back. Here is why we are ripping through $60: • **Uncle Sam is the Whale:** The US Gov literally bought an **$8.9 Billion equity stake**. It’s officially too big to fail. If you short this, you are fighting the printing press. • **Literal Infinite Demand:** KeyBanc just confirmed that **2026 server CPU capacity is 100% SOLD OUT**. Hyperscalers are desperate for chips, and Intel is jacking up prices because they can. • **The Apple Leak:** Trump slipped up and said \"Apple went in\" after the government deal. If Tim Apple starts printing M-chips in Ohio on the new 18A node, the bears are absolutely cooked. • **Yields are Good:** 18A yields are hitting 60-75%. The tech actually works. Lip-Bu Tan (new CEO) isn't playing games. Earnings are **Jan 22**. The rocket is fueling up. **TL;DR:** Grandma Guy was right, just early. Buy shares to respect your elders. 🚀🚀🚀",

Nana isn ’ t rolling in her grave anymore she ’ s popping bottles in Valhalla . The National Champion is back . Here is why we are ripping through $ 60 • Uncle Sam is the Whale The US Gov literally bought an $ 8.9 Billion equity stake . It ’ s officially too big to fail . If you short this you are fighting the printing press . • Literal Infinite Demand KeyBanc just confirmed that 2026 server CPU capacity is 100 % SOLD OUT . Hyperscalers are desperate for chips and Intel is jacking up prices because they can . • The Apple Leak Trump slipped up and said Apple went in after the government deal . If Tim Apple starts printing Mchips in Ohio on the new 18A node the bears are absolutely cooked . • Yields are Good 18A yields are hitting 6075 % . The tech actually works .

Anyway, onto the DD... I'll keep this short, over the past few weeks, IRWD has seen two pieces of news that aren’t huge on their own, but together meaningfully improve the stock. Linzess sales blowout * \\-Q3 Linzess sales came in at **\\~$315–350M vs. \\~$250M expected** * \\-Ironwood receives **\\~33% of Linzess sales** * \\-That translates to **\\~$104M in revenue this quarter**, up from **\\~$85M last quarter** * \\-That’s roughly **+$20M per quarter**, or **\\~$80M annually**, above expectations * \\-This was a much larger jump than anticipated and strengthens profitability going forward Pediatric label expansion * \\-Linzess received FDA label expansion for pediatric patients * \\-This makes Linzess the first drug available for this pediatric indication * \\-Expands the addressable market with limited competition * \\-Should further support future sales growth In Summery * \\-Both updates are clearly bullish * \\-Revenue is already strong and now has an added tailwind * \\-There’s currently very little bearish news in the near term * \\-The next key catalyst will be the **upcoming quarterly report**, especially any updates on the pipeline * \\-There is mostly upswing with a potential of 2x-3x in the next 6 months. That's it, pretty simple and easy play that I can see. Not financial advice — do your own DD. Good luck! My positions: [",

      "selftext_processed": "So before you go sleuthing through my profile my 10 year old account got nuked recently over some mildly controversial comments ... So now I have this baby account and Im not_a bot and just want to put that out there first . Anyway onto the DD ... Ill keep this short over the past few weeks IRWD has seen two pieces of news that aren ’ t huge on their own but together meaningfully improve the stock . Linzess sales blowout Q3 Linzess sales came in at $ 315–350M vs. $ 250M expected Ironwood receives 33 % of Linzess sales That translates to $ 104M in revenue this quarter up from $ 85M last quarter That ’ s roughly $ 20M per quarter or $ 80M annually above expectations This was a much larger jump than anticipated and strengthens profitability going forward Pediatric label expansion Linzess received FDA label expansion for pediatric patients This makes Linzess the first drug available for this pediatric indication Expands the addressable market with limited competition Should further support future sales growth In Summery Both updates are clearly bullish Revenue is already strong and now has an added tailwind There ’ s currently very little bearish news in the near term The next key catalyst will be the upcoming quarterly report especially any updates on the pipeline There is mostly upswing with a potential of 2x3x in the next 6 months . Thats it pretty simple and easy play that I can see . Not_financial advice — do your own DD . Good luck My positions"
