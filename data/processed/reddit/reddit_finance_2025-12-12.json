      "selftext": "I believe rare earth metals will at some point be in heated discussion again. This will be a negative catalyst, which will cause market downturn except for companies like LAC, MP, USAR. Some of the few companies which offset or hedge against: * export restriction talks * geopolitical tension regarding minerals * tariff escalation fighting for minerals * supply-chain “reshoring” There's really only few things which can rock this market, for example AI earnings start to come in bad, or the countries fighting for AI domination will begin to attack the resources used to power these machines. There's fundamental drift as well as LAC inches closer to opening in 2027. This is a long term investment with shares, the price action reached $10 before when this tension brewed, which imo will rebound as this tension comes back in some form in 2026. This gives a hedge opportunity and long term investment into commodities, or what will be North America's biggest lithium mine.",

      "selftext": "# TL;DR Here’s the whole thesis: If you believe space launches will increase, if you expect NASA, commercial satellite operators, national-security agencies, and private launch companies to keep expanding activity into orbit, then KRMN is a little-known company you *need* to know. ================================= # The Short & Sweet Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is a little-known **aerospace and defense** company posting numbers that look nothing like the obscurity of its stock. Revenue up 23% YoY, net income up 191%, and a funded backlog up 35%, with guidance calling for another year *(and beyond)* of **double-digit expansion**. For a company most of you haven’t even heard of, these are eye-popping metrics. The driver is straightforward: Karman builds high-spec structures, subsystems, and assemblies for **missiles, hypersonics, and next-gen launch vehicles**. Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–high-temperature alloys, for materials used in **strategic missile programs** where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive. That move pushed Karman deeper into **classified supply chains** tied to U.S. rearmament, allied purchases, and the global shift toward tactical missile systems. Karman also sits inside both of the next-decade launch platforms: **Blue Origin’s New Glenn and ULA’s Vulcan**. Each is designed for national security, deep-space, and commercial missions. And since Karman supplies structural components to *both* vehicles, you don’t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst. **Karman wins either way**. Karman’s core markets (missile defense, hypersonics, and launch systems) are expanding, not contracting. That makes its recent pullback attractive. **Takeaway:** Karman is a company that sits inside every major missile and launch trend, and that trend will just accelerate. ================================= What fueled **KRMN's 189% run** since its IPO on February 13? # The Long & Winding Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is an under-the-radar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. **space and missile-defense programs**. But before we talk about what this company actually *does*, we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings. After all, **numbers don’t care about narratives**. They don’t hype. They simply record the truth, especially the kind most people don't pay attention to. Karman’s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual. A company whose trajectory doesn’t match its obscurity. **Growth hiding behind small-cap camouflage**. # The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small, the numbers don’t lie. They signal momentum, and momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental. # FY2024: A Record Across the Board On April 8, 2025, KRMN reported: * **Revenue**: $345.3M, **+23% YoY** * **Net income**: $12.7M, **+191.3% YoY** * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $106.1M, **+29.7% YoY** * **Funded backlog**: $579.8M, **+35.2% YoY** For a small-cap contractor, these are not ordinary numbers. This is a company stepping into a larger orbit (*get it?*) # 2025 Outlook: Expansion, Not Consolidation For FY2025, Karman expects: * **Revenue**: $423–$433M * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $132–$137M **Double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth**. # Q1 2025: The Trend Continued On May 13, 2025: * **EPS**: $0.05 (vs. $0.02 est.) * **Revenue**: $100.12M, **+20.6% YoY** Guidance reaffirmed. No slowdown. At this point, some of you might realize that even though you’ve never heard of this company, these numbers look interesting. And they are. Because once you peel back the veil, the reason becomes obvious. # The CEO Speaks After delivering the [Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025]( Tony Koblinski, Karman’s Chief Executive Officer, summarized it this way: >“Across numerous key metrics, we achieved record performance in 2024 that **positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond**. >Each of our end markets delivered **double-digit topline growth** and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and **national priorities** in missiles, tactical defense systems, and space and launch systems.” [Karman Space & Defense Full-Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results]( []( Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside **America’s missile defense buildup, hypersonic development race, and next-generation launch ecosystem**. But to understand how deep that goes, we begin with a move that opened new doors. # The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year, Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. (MTI), a company specializing in **ultra-high-temperature refractory alloys** used in strategic missile systems. MTI works with materials such as Tantalum, Zirconium, Niobium, Vanadium, and Molybdenum. These aren’t ordinary metals. They are **engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys**. With this acquisition, Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities, access to high-specification missile programs, **deeper integration into classified supply chains**, increased revenue and EBITDA, and expanded design and manufacturing scope. KRMN reaffirmed that it is not just a supplier, but a *strategic* supplier. # Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles. Why? Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished, global conflicts have continued to drive demand, allies are purchasing next-generation tactical systems, and missile defense is entering a new strategic era. Karman provides the structures, subsystems, and assemblies that make these systems operational. Now, it’s not about whether there’s a war or not. Of course, I don’t want *any* wars. But even in peacetime, **missile defense isn’t slowing down**. It’s accelerating. And now Karman sits closer to the core. # Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highest-temperature, highest-priority arms race on Earth. **Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade**. Every major power is investing, testing, and racing toward Mach-5+ platforms. But **few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses**. Karman is one of them. This segment’s revenue surged thanks to well-funded programs in both development and production, **backed by aggressive government budgets**. Karman’s offerings (propulsion, deployable shrouds, launchers, energetic subsystems) are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems. This is not speculative work. This is strategic infrastructure. # Space and Launch Systems This is **where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge**. Revenue here increased due to Karman’s involvement in two next-generation launch vehicles. # Blue Origin’s New Glenn A heavy-lift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites, space infrastructure, and future deep-space missions. It is still in a development stage. Although, on November 13, 2025, the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time. The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027. Blue Origin’s customer base: * Commercial satellite operators. * Government payloads. * Potential national-security missions. [New Glenn]( is designed to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy. Its reusable first stage, massive payload capacity, and **long-term contract potential with DoD and NASA** make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem. Karman supplies components used in New Glenn’s structures and launch systems. # ULA’s Vulcan A next-generation launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). [Vulcan]( is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV, the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. national-security launches. It has already flown its first successful mission. This rocket is built to serve: * U.S. Space Force. * DoD national-security missions. * Commercial payloads. * NASA deep-space missions. Vulcan is engineered specifically for **National Security Space Launch (NSSL)** contracts: The elite, highest-priority, and highest-specification launches in America’s defense architecture and orbital missions. It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defense-related payloads over the next decade. And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan’s architecture. # Whichever Rocket Wins, Karman Wins This isn’t about picking sides in the rocket race. It isn’t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads, or which timeline slips, or which program accelerates. Karman supplies critical hardware to *both* ULA’s Vulcan and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. Karman’s components run through the veins of *both* launch systems. Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts, Karman wins with it. If national-security payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another, the outcome is the same: **Karman benefits either way**. # Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play. **If you understand this one idea**, the rest of the thesis can open itself to you. **You don’t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade**. You don’t have to choose heads or tails. Because with Karman, **it isn’t about the side of the coin**. **It’s just about the coin being flipped into the air**. **As long as rockets are being launched** (commercial, government, national-security, deep-space, doesn’t matter) **Karman benefits**. The rivalry is irrelevant. **The activity itself is the catalyst**. # The Short-Term Decline Now, yes, Karman, like many other growth names, was bruised over the past few weeks. The stock is down –24.80% since the close on November 3, 2025. Personally, I bought (and keep buying) the dip *gradually*. There was support in the high $50s (Karman has bounced from there, though), and the stock did ride a +23.37% rally in four days (Nov 21-26), so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap. Check the chart. Once it runs, it runs north fast. I did buy a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** for cheap, though. Of course, this one is a cheap, low-risk, high-reward play if it works. Quite simply, the stock can move $10 in a couple of days, and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike, these become multi-baggers. But, again, the main play is for the long-term. You should also know the KRMN play, although great for swings, is mostly meant for the **long term**. This is a **structural story**, not a short-lived trade. # Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23, portfolio manager [Randy Gwirtzman]( of Baron Capital published a Barron’s article highlighting small-cap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential. He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward **companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions**. His focus, however, is on profitability, a key filter, especially when bond yields spike. Karman Holdings popped up on his list. And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could **benefit enormously** in the coming years: **Trump’s Golden Dome plans**. Now, everything in this post has been the backdrop, the scaffolding, the necessary foundation. In my next post, if this DD gets approved/noticed, I’ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself, what it is, why it matters, and why a small, overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly, along with several more developments from KRMN. Have a nice day. ================================= Shares, cost basis $58.99 And a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** (these are cheap risk, high reward, though!) because they were dirt cheap, and I know KRMN can move $7-10 in two or three days. However, the play is long-term.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Here ’ s the whole thesis If you believe space launches will increase if you expect NASA commercial satellite operators nationalsecurity agencies and private launch companies to keep expanding activity into orbit then KRMN is a littleknown company you need to know . The Short Sweet Karman Holdings $ KRMN is a littleknown aerospace and defense company posting numbers that look nothing_like the obscurity of its stock . Revenue up 23 % YoY net income up 191 % and a funded backlog up 35 % with guidance calling for another year and beyond of doubledigit expansion . For a company most of you haven ’ t even heard of these are eyepopping metrics . The driver is straightforward Karman builds highspec structures subsystems and assemblies for missiles hypersonics and nextgen launch vehicles . Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–hightemperature alloys for materials used in strategic missile programs where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive . That move pushed Karman deeper into classified supply chains tied to U.S. rearmament allied purchases and the global shift toward tactical missile systems . Karman also sits inside both of the nextdecade launch platforms Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn and ULA ’ s Vulcan . Each is designed for national security deepspace and commercial missions . And since Karman supplies structural components to both vehicles you don ’ t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst . Karman wins either way . Karman ’ s core markets missile defense hypersonics and launch systems are expanding not_contracting . That makes its recent pullback attractive . Takeaway Karman is a company that sits inside every major missile and launch trend and that trend will just accelerate . What fueled KRMNs 189 % run since its IPO on February 13 The Long Winding Karman Holdings $ KRMN is an undertheradar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. space and missiledefense programs . But before we talk about what this company actually does we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings . After all numbers don ’ t care about narratives . They don ’ t hype . They simply record the truth especially the kind most people dont pay attention to . Karman ’ s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual . A company whose trajectory doesn ’ t match its obscurity . Growth hiding behind smallcap camouflage . The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small the numbers don ’ t lie . They signal momentum and momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental . FY2024 A Record Across the Board On April 8 2025 KRMN reported Revenue $ 345.3M 23 % YoY Net income $ 12.7M 191.3 % YoY Adjusted EBITDA $ 106.1M 29.7 % YoY Funded backlog $ 579.8M 35.2 % YoY For a smallcap contractor these are not_ordinary numbers . This is a company stepping into a larger orbit get it 2025 Outlook Expansion Not_Consolidation For FY2025 Karman expects Revenue $ 423– $ 433M Adjusted EBITDA $ 132– $ 137M Doubledigit growth on top of doubledigit growth . Q1 2025 The Trend Continued On May 13 2025 EPS $ 0.05 vs. $ 0.02 est . Revenue $ 100.12M 20.6 % YoY Guidance reaffirmed . No_slowdown . At this point some of you might realize that even though you ’ ve never_heard of this company these numbers look interesting . And they are . Because once you peel back the veil the reason becomes obvious . The CEO Speaks After delivering the Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025 Tony Koblinski Karman ’ s Chief Executive Officer summarized it this way “ Across numerous key metrics we achieved record performance in 2024 that positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond . Each of our end markets delivered doubledigit topline growth and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and national priorities in missiles tactical defense systems and space and launch systems. ” Karman Space Defense FullFiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside America ’ s missile defense buildup hypersonic development race and nextgeneration launch ecosystem . But to understand how deep that goes we begin with a move that opened new doors . The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. MTI a company specializing in ultrahightemperature refractory alloys used in strategic missile systems . MTI works with materials such as Tantalum Zirconium Niobium Vanadium and Molybdenum . These aren ’ t ordinary metals . They are engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys . With this acquisition Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities access to highspecification missile programs deeper integration into classified supply chains increased revenue and EBITDA and expanded design and manufacturing scope . KRMN reaffirmed that it is not_just a supplier but a strategic supplier . Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles . Why Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished global conflicts have continued to drive demand allies are purchasing nextgeneration tactical systems and missile defense is entering a new strategic era . Karman provides the structures subsystems and assemblies that make these systems operational . Now it ’ s not_about whether there ’ s a war or not_Of course I don ’ t want any wars . But even in peacetime missile defense isn ’ t slowing down . It ’ s accelerating . And now Karman sits closer to the core . Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highesttemperature highestpriority arms race on Earth . Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade . Every major power is investing testing and racing toward Mach5 platforms . But few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses . Karman is one of them . This segment ’ s revenue surged thanks to wellfunded programs in both development and production backed by aggressive government budgets . Karman ’ s offerings propulsion deployable shrouds launchers energetic subsystems are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems . This is not_speculative work . This is strategic infrastructure . Space and Launch Systems This is where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge . Revenue here increased due to Karman ’ s involvement in two nextgeneration launch vehicles . Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn A heavylift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites space infrastructure and future deepspace missions . It is still in a development stage . Although on November 13 2025 the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time . The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027 . Blue Origin ’ s customer base Commercial satellite operators . Government payloads . Potential nationalsecurity missions . New Glenn is designed to compete with SpaceX ’ s Falcon Heavy . Its reusable first stage massive payload capacity and longterm contract potential with DoD and NASA make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem . Karman supplies components used in New Glenn ’ s structures and launch systems . ULA ’ s Vulcan A nextgeneration launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance a joint venture between Boeing BA and Lockheed Martin LMT . Vulcan is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. nationalsecurity launches . It has already flown its first successful mission . This rocket is built to serve U.S. Space Force . DoD nationalsecurity missions . Commercial payloads . NASA deepspace missions . Vulcan is engineered specifically for National Security Space Launch NSSL contracts The elite highestpriority and highestspecification launches in America ’ s defense architecture and orbital missions . It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defenserelated payloads over the next decade . And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan ’ s architecture . Whichever Rocket Wins Karman Wins This isn ’ t about picking sides in the rocket race . It isn ’ t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads or which timeline slips or which program accelerates . Karman supplies critical hardware to both ULA ’ s Vulcan and Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn . Karman ’ s components run through the veins of both launch systems . Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts Karman wins with it . If nationalsecurity payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another the outcome is the same Karman benefits either way . Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play . If you understand this one idea the rest of the thesis can open itself to you . You don ’ t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade . You don ’ t have to choose heads or tails . Because with Karman it isn ’ t about the side of the coin . It ’ s just about the coin being flipped into the air . As long as rockets are being launched commercial government nationalsecurity deepspace doesn ’ t matter Karman benefits . The rivalry is irrelevant . The activity itself is the catalyst . The ShortTerm Decline Now yes Karman like many other growth names was bruised over the past few weeks . The stock is down –24.80 % since the close on November 3 2025 . Personally I bought and keep buying the dip gradually . There was support in the high $ 50s Karman has bounced from there though and the stock did ride a 23.37 % rally in four days Nov 2126 so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap . Check the chart . Once it runs it runs north fast . I did buy a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls for cheap though . Of course this one is a cheap lowrisk highreward play if it works . Quite simply the stock can move $ 10 in a couple of days and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike these become multibaggers . But again the main play is for the longterm . You should also know the KRMN play although great for swings is mostly meant for the long term . This is a structural story not_a shortlived trade . Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23 portfolio manager Randy Gwirtzman of Baron Capital published a Barron ’ s article highlighting smallcap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential . He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions . His focus however is on profitability a key filter especially when bond yields spike . Karman Holdings popped up on his list . And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could benefit enormously in the coming years Trump ’ s Golden Dome plans . Now everything in this post has been the backdrop the scaffolding the necessary foundation . In my next post if this DD gets approvednoticed I ’ ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself what it is why it matters and why a small overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly along with several more developments from KRMN . Have a nice day . Shares cost basis $ 58.99 And a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls these are cheap risk high reward though because they were dirt cheap and I know KRMN can move $ 710 in two or three days . However the play is longterm ."

      "selftext": "This probably somewhat of a hot take, and I know it might piss dividend or value investors off, but I've been wondering why anyone still bothers holding the old school defensive stocks like consumer staples... I understand that different investors have different goals, time horizons, risk appetites, but still. Conventional wisdom says you hold these kinds of stocks to protect your portfolio and stay diversified through tough times, no matter what the economy is doing. We've been told that these stocks have steady demand, predictable revenue, and the cherry on top is the big dividend. Now it doesn't really feel that way with many of these companies facing multiple headwinds. Consumers are tightening up on spending, there's tons of competition, and inflation is killing them. Input costs keep rising, prices keep going up for the consumer, and at some point they will stop paying those higher prices. When that happens, you either have to cut price or have your margins cut. Either way, not great for the stock or the business... Look at the YTD performance for some of these stocks: \\- $CL down 14.69% YTD \\- $PG down 15.19% YTD \\- $KVUE down 18.61% YTD \\- $KMB down 20.81% YTD \\- $CLX down 36.46% YTD Most of these names are sitting near their 52 week lows, and even with the higher dividend yields, I’m struggling to see where the “protection” is supposed to come from. Most people holding these stocks probably aren’t expecting a ton of growth, but if you’re not buying them for growth, what are you buying them for? Maybe you own it for the dividend, but then what do you do in a year like this? At what point are you just chasing yield and ignoring how the stock is actually performing? If you're really looking for protection, or a hedge, why not just own gold? It's something that is defensive and will protect you in any environment. Maybe this all sounds \"toppy\" for me to say with the S&P close to all time highs. Maybe the smart thing to do is fade this post entirely, be a contrarian, buy these stocks, and wait for the rebound. However, I just don't really see the point right now. Please take all of this with a grain of salt as I'm in my late 20's and could be completely wrong.",

      "selftext_processed": "This probably somewhat of a hot take and I know it might piss dividend or value investors off but Ive been wondering why anyone still bothers holding the old school defensive stocks like consumer staples ... I understand that different investors have different goals time horizons risk appetites but still . Conventional wisdom says you hold these kinds of stocks to protect your portfolio and stay diversified through tough times no_matter what the economy is doing . Weve been told that these stocks have steady demand predictable revenue and the cherry on top is the big dividend . Now it doesnt really feel that way with many of these companies facing multiple headwinds . Consumers are tightening up on spending theres tons of competition and inflation is killing them . Input costs keep rising prices keep going up for the consumer and at some point they will stop paying those higher prices . When that happens you either have to cut price or have your margins cut . Either way not_great for the stock or the business ... Look at the YTD performance for some of these stocks $ CL down 14.69 % YTD $ PG down 15.19 % YTD $ KVUE down 18.61 % YTD $ KMB down 20.81 % YTD $ CLX down 36.46 % YTD Most of these names are sitting near their 52 week lows and even with the higher dividend yields I ’ m struggling to see where the “ protection ” is supposed to come from . Most people holding these stocks probably aren ’ t expecting a ton of growth but if you ’ re not_buying them for growth what are you buying them for Maybe you own it for the dividend but then what do you do in a year like this At what point are you just chasing yield and ignoring how the stock is actually performing If youre really looking for protection or a hedge why not_just own gold Its something that is defensive and will protect you in any environment . Maybe this all sounds toppy for me to say with the SP close to all time highs . Maybe the smart thing to do is fade this post entirely be a contrarian buy these stocks and wait for the rebound . However I just dont really see the point right now . Please take all of this with a grain of salt as Im in my late 20s and could be completely wrong ."

Looking at the performance of the top holdings, it doesn’t seem that any of then had THAT bad of a day; some losers, but nothing huge from what I could see. Same with GSPK to a lesser extent; down 5% on the day while the general indexes didn’t get walloped that badly ( maybe Oracle contributed, but it’s not a top ten holding). What am I missing here? Not looking for critiques of the funds themselves right now, but wondering how one can go down 30% in a day while the stocks themselves didnt shit the bed all that bad. TIA",

Looking at the performance of the top holdings it doesn ’ t seem that any of then had THAT bad of a day some losers but nothing_huge from what I could see . Same with GSPK to a lesser extent down 5 % on the day while the general indexes didn ’ t get walloped that badly maybe Oracle contributed but it ’ s not_a top ten holding . What am I missing here Not_looking for critiques of the funds themselves right now but wondering how one can go down 30 % in a day while the stocks themselves didnt shit the bed all that bad . TIA"

The bottom line is money, and the momentum of the USA economy is less discretionary money for an expanding portion of consumers. Who will buy those sweet red roses? \"Business is flush with cash,\" you say? How long? Robots? Competition has caused robots to drop in price. One million robots sold for $1000 is $1 billion. Not $1 trillion. It would take over four billion robots sold at $1000 to equal NVDA market cap. Chips are a component of that $1000. \"NVidia valuation if for data centers,\" you say? To serve who? Businesses selling ads? To who? The 1%? Do you see the math problem? So, let's consider two challenges coming. 1. AI bubble bursts. I have NVDA and INTC as short targets. 2. Japan carry trade unwind. I have TM as a safety hedge. So, my plan is to use gains from price declines in NVDA and INTC using put options to buy call options and shares in TM. The further upside is that TM has growth potential in its core business and as a Japan company it has stock price growth potential from a hyperinflated dollar. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "\\>The order would create one federal regulatory framework for artificial intelligence, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \\>President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that aims to neuter state laws that place limits on the artificial intelligence industry, a win for tech companies that have lobbied against regulation of the booming technology. \\>Mr. Trump, who has said it is important for America to dominate A.I., has criticized the state laws for generating a confusing patchwork of regulations. He said his order would create one federal regulatory framework that would override the state laws, and added that it was critical to keep the United States ahead of China in a battle for leadership on the technology. \\>“It’s got to be one source,” Mr. Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office. “You can’t go to 50 different sources.” \\>The president has increasingly embraced the A.I. industry, signing executive orders to limit regulation, provide access to federal data and make it easier for companies to build infrastructure to power the technology. He has also knocked down barriers to exporting chips that drive A.I., including this week, and publicly praised the companies’ leaders. And he has given David Sacks, his A.I. and crypto czar and a Silicon Valley investor, heavy influence over policy decisions. \\> The order on Thursday, which has sparked broad, bipartisan opposition, is likely to be challenged in court by states and consumer groups on the grounds that only Congress has the authority to override state laws, legal experts said. \\>If Mr. Trump succeeds in neutering state laws, he should instead offer a robust national standard on A.I. regulations, said Wes Hodges, the acting director of the Center for Technology and the Human Person at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. \\>“Doing so before establishing commensurate national protections is a carve-out for Big Tech,” Mr. Hodges said. \\>New generative A.I. technology that can imitate human writing and voices and create realistic videos and images has taken off. But the technology can be misused to trick consumers, and chatbots have been documented offering harmful advice to minors, among other issues. \\> States have rushed to fill a void of federal regulation with their own laws on A.I. safety, requiring certain safety measures from companies and putting guardrails around the way the technology can be used. This year, all 50 states and territories introduced A.I. legislation and 38 states adopted about 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California and Colorado have passed laws that require the biggest A.I. models, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, to test for safety and to disclose the results. South Dakota passed a law banning deepfakes, which are realistic A.I.-generated videos, in political advertisements within months of an election. Utah, Illinois and Nevada passed laws related to A.I. chatbots and mental health, requiring disclosures that users are engaging with chatbots and adding restrictions on data collection. \\>States have also passed a growing number of child-safety regulations targeting A.I. chatbots and social media companies that use A.I.-based technologies. \\>“Blocking state laws regulating A.I. is an unacceptable nightmare for parents and anyone who cares about protecting children online,” said Sarah Gardner, the chief executive of Heat Initiative, a child safety group. “States have been the only effective line of defense against A.I. harms.” \\> A.I. companies have waged a fierce lobbying campaign in Congress and the White House to get rid of the state regulations. Earlier this year, some lawmakers attempted to include a decade-long moratorium on state A.I. laws in the domestic policy bill, but dropped the measure after strong bipartisan opposition. \\>“A 50-state patchwork is a startup killer,” Marc Andreessen of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz posted on social media last month.",

President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that aims to neuter state laws that place limits on the artificial intelligence industry a win for tech companies that have lobbied against regulation of the booming technology . Mr. Trump who has said it is important for America to dominate A.I . has criticized the state laws for generating a confusing patchwork of regulations . He said his order would create one federal regulatory framework that would override the state laws and added that it was critical to keep the United States ahead of China in a battle for leadership on the technology . “ It ’ s got to be one source ” Mr. Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office . “ You can ’ t go to 50 different sources. ” The president has increasingly embraced the A.I . industry signing executive orders to limit regulation provide access to federal data and make it easier for companies to build infrastructure to power the technology . He has also knocked down barriers to exporting chips that drive A.I . including this week and publicly praised the companies ’ leaders . And he has given David Sacks his A.I . and crypto czar and a Silicon Valley investor heavy influence over policy decisions . The order on Thursday which has sparked broad bipartisan opposition is likely to be challenged in court by states and consumer groups on the grounds that only Congress has the authority to override state laws legal experts said . If Mr. Trump succeeds in neutering state laws he should instead offer a robust national standard on A.I . regulations said Wes Hodges the acting director of the Center for Technology and the Human Person at the rightleaning Heritage Foundation . “ Doing so before establishing commensurate national protections is a carveout for Big Tech ” Mr. Hodges said . New generative A.I . technology that can imitate human writing and voices and create realistic videos and images has taken off . But the technology can be misused to trick consumers and chatbots have been documented offering harmful advice to minors among other issues . States have rushed to fill a void of federal regulation with their own laws on A.I . safety requiring certain safety measures from companies and putting guardrails around the way the technology can be used . This year all 50 states and territories introduced A.I . legislation and 38 states adopted about 100 laws according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . California and Colorado have passed laws that require the biggest A.I . models including OpenAI ’ s ChatGPT and Google ’ s Gemini to test for safety and to disclose the results . South Dakota passed a law banning deepfakes which are realistic A.I.generated videos in political advertisements within months of an election . Utah Illinois and Nevada passed laws related to A.I . chatbots and mental health requiring disclosures that users are engaging with chatbots and adding restrictions on data collection . States have also passed a growing number of childsafety regulations targeting A.I . chatbots and social media companies that use A.I.based technologies . “ Blocking state laws regulating A.I . is an unacceptable nightmare for parents and anyone who cares about protecting children online ” said Sarah Gardner the chief executive of Heat Initiative a child safety group . “ States have been the only effective line of defense against A.I . harms. ” A.I . companies have waged a fierce lobbying campaign in Congress and the White House to get rid of the state regulations . Earlier this year some lawmakers attempted to include a decadelong moratorium on state A.I . laws in the domestic policy bill but dropped the measure after strong bipartisan opposition . “ A 50state patchwork is a startup killer ” Marc Andreessen of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz posted on social media last month ."

      "selftext": "[As reported by Washington Post today at 6:26pm EST]( the Trump administration will soon move forward with rescheduling cannabis from a schedule 1 to schedule 3 drug. From the article: >President Donald Trump is expected to push the government to dramatically loosen federal restrictions on marijuana, reducing oversight of the plant and its derivatives to the same level as some common prescription painkillers and other drugs, according to six people familiar with the discussions. >Trump discussed the plan with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) in a Wednesday phone call from the Oval Office, said four of the people, who, like the others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The president is expected to seek to ease access to the drug through an upcoming executive order that directs federal agencies to pursue reclassification, the people said. >The president was joined Wednesday by marijuana industry executives, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief Mehmet Oz, three of the people said. >On the call, Johnson was skeptical of the idea and gave a list of reasons, including several studies and data, to support his position against reclassifying the drug, two of the people said. >Trump then turned the phone over to the executives gathered around his desk, who rebutted Johnson’s arguments, the people said. >Trump ended the call appearing ready to go ahead with loosing restrictions on marijuana, the people said, though they caution the plans were not finalized and Trump could still change his mind. If rescheduling does occur, it would be the most significant cannabis reform at the federal level in over 50 years. It would remove the 280e tax burden on US cannabis companies, a tax law that currently prevents them from taking tax deductions which forces them to pay 70%+ tax rates and prevents many from ever being profitable, and would bring their tax rates down to levels comparable with other businesses, dramatically improving the financials of these companies. It would also mean that the federal government acknowledges that cannabis has actual medical uses which would have a wide array of benefits like more research and federal medical cannabis regulations. Cannabis stocks are rallying on this news in the after hours, with $MSOS, $TLRY and $CGC up 30%+. My personal favorite picks and stocks that I am holding in the space are $GTBIF for their clean financials and $TCNNF for their dominance in Florida.",

      "selftext_processed": "As reported by Washington Post today at 626pm EST the Trump administration will soon move forward with rescheduling cannabis from a schedule 1 to schedule 3 drug . From the article President Donald Trump is expected to push the government to dramatically loosen federal restrictions on marijuana reducing oversight of the plant and its derivatives to the same level as some common prescription painkillers and other drugs according to six people familiar with the discussions . Trump discussed the plan with House Speaker Mike Johnson RLouisiana in a Wednesday phone call from the Oval Office said four of the people who like the others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not_authorized to speak publicly . The president is expected to seek to ease access to the drug through an upcoming executive order that directs federal agencies to pursue reclassification the people said . The president was joined Wednesday by marijuana industry executives Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief Mehmet Oz three of the people said . On the call Johnson was skeptical of the idea and gave a list of reasons including several studies and data to support his position against reclassifying the drug two of the people said . Trump then turned the phone over to the executives gathered around his desk who rebutted Johnson ’ s arguments the people said . Trump ended the call appearing ready to go ahead with loosing restrictions on marijuana the people said though they caution the plans were not_finalized and Trump could still change his mind . If rescheduling does occur it would be the most significant cannabis reform at the federal level in over 50 years . It would remove the 280e tax burden on US cannabis companies a tax law that currently prevents them from taking tax deductions which forces them to pay 70 % tax rates and prevents many from ever being profitable and would bring their tax rates down to levels comparable with other businesses dramatically improving the financials of these companies . It would also mean that the federal government acknowledges that cannabis has actual medical uses which would have a wide array of benefits like more research and federal medical cannabis regulations . Cannabis stocks are rallying on this news in the after hours with $ MSOS $ TLRY and $ CGC up 30 % . My personal favorite picks and stocks that I am holding in the space are $ GTBIF for their clean financials and $ TCNNF for their dominance in Florida ."

      "selftext": "Earnings season doesn’t start at the moment the numbers drop the real win or loss is usually set days or even weeks before the data is released.Market microstructure tells us that price reacts to the difference between the numbers and expectations, not the numbers themselves.So the key to staying ahead of earnings isn’t predicting the results， it’s understanding what the market thinks should happen,and what it means if the actual data comes in above or below that expectation.If you can see that clearly, you can position before earnings day instead of waiting for the market to tell you what to do The first step is analyzing consensus expectations.Wall Street’s consensus shows up in sell side models, EPS/revenue forecasts, guidance previews, and implied volatility in the options market.If expectations are too high, the company has to clear an unrealistic bar just to go up. If expectations are too low, “not getting worse” can be enough to trigger a rally.It’s not the absolute quality of the earnings that moves price it’s whether the numbers beat the market’s psychological curve.Pros don’t ask, “Will earnings be good?”They ask, “Will the market be satisfied with this report?” The second step is looking at the marginal change in fundamentals.Earnings are just a periodic snapshot, but what the market really cares about is whether the trend is improving or deteriorating.Revenue dropping isn’t automatically bad revenue dropping more slowly is good.A margin improvement isn’t about lower costs it’s about whether the improvement is sustainable.Institutions care more about the direction than the absolute number. So the real question is:If key metrics show marginal improvement, will the market treat it as a trend reversal? And if the metrics worsen, will the market treat it as a structural issue? If you can read the trajectory, you can know how the market will price the report before earnings hit. The third step is analyzing market positioning. Implied volatility, gamma exposure, OI clusters, and short interest tell you which side capital is leaning toward. If short interest is heavily concentrated, the real earnings risk isn’t downside it’s an upside squeeze. If IV is crushed, the market isn’t pricing in any bad news, which means even a minor miss can cause a bigger-than-usual drop. Positioning often determines the size of the move more than the earnings numbers themselves.Institutions aren’t trying to predict earnings they’re predicting whether the market is ready for the outcome The fourth step is watching management’s signals and behavior. Tone in recent calls, changes in capex, early order disclosures, delayed contract updates, inventory and hiring trends, and even the cadence of stock based compensation all reveal how the company feels about the coming cycle.A sudden hiring freeze signals they expect softness ahead. A ramp up in buybacks usually means management thinks the stock is undervalued.Behavior is more honest than language. To judge earnings ahead of time, you look at what management is doing, not just what they’re saying. The fifth step is studying liquidity structure.The size of an earnings move is often driven by liquidity, not the actual numbers.Dark pool ratios, liquidity pockets, execution patterns, algo flows, and vacuum zones show you how much space the stock has to move.If there’s no support below, even a small miss can trigger back to back gaps.If liquidity is thin above, a beat can cause an accelerated breakout. Understanding earnings ahead of time is about understanding market structure, not predicting the line items. In the end, predicting earnings “correctly” isn’t about forecasting the numbers The most professional thing you can do before earnings is build your own framework around these five dimensions, so you’re standing in front of the move instead of chasing it，When you can do that, earnings day stops being a gamble. You’re not guessing direction ， you’re trading the expectation gap.，You’re not reacting ， you’re already positioned，The outcome doesn’t surprise you because the structure already told you the answer long before the numbers hit Final note this is just my personal view.If there’s anything I missed, feel free to add on.And yeah, it’s totally possible that me calling these last few earnings plays was just luck. But hopefully some of this can help, even a little",

      "selftext_processed": "Earnings season doesn ’ t start at the moment the numbers drop the real win or loss is usually set days or even weeks before the data is released.Market microstructure tells us that price reacts to the difference between the numbers and expectations not_the numbers themselves.So the key to staying ahead of earnings isn ’ t predicting the results， it ’ s understanding what the market thinks should happenand what it means if the actual data comes in above or below that expectation.If you can see that clearly you can position before earnings day instead of waiting for the market to tell you what to do The first step is analyzing consensus expectations.Wall Street ’ s consensus shows up in sell side models EPSrevenue forecasts guidance previews and implied volatility in the options market.If expectations are too high the company has to clear an unrealistic bar just to go up . If expectations are too low “ not getting worse ” can be enough to trigger a rally.It ’ s not_the absolute quality of the earnings that moves price it ’ s whether the numbers beat the market ’ s psychological curve.Pros don ’ t ask “ Will earnings be good ” They ask “ Will the market be satisfied with this report ” The second step is looking at the marginal change in fundamentals.Earnings are just a periodic snapshot but what the market really cares about is whether the trend is improving or deteriorating.Revenue dropping isn ’ t automatically bad revenue dropping more slowly is good.A margin improvement isn ’ t about lower costs it ’ s about whether the improvement is sustainable.Institutions care more about the direction than the absolute number . So the real question isIf key metrics show marginal improvement will the market treat it as a trend reversal And if the metrics worsen will the market treat it as a structural issue If you can read the trajectory you can know how the market will price the report before earnings hit . The third step is analyzing market positioning . Implied volatility gamma exposure OI clusters and short interest tell you which side capital is leaning toward . If short interest is heavily concentrated the real earnings risk isn ’ t downside it ’ s an upside squeeze . If IV is crushed the market isn ’ t pricing in any bad news which means even a minor miss can cause a biggerthanusual drop . Positioning often determines the size of the move more than the earnings numbers themselves.Institutions aren ’ t trying to predict earnings they ’ re predicting whether the market is ready for the outcome The fourth step is watching management ’ s signals and behavior . Tone in recent calls changes in capex early order disclosures delayed contract updates inventory and hiring trends and even the cadence of stock based compensation all reveal how the company feels about the coming cycle.A sudden hiring freeze signals they expect softness ahead . A ramp up in buybacks usually means management thinks the stock is undervalued.Behavior is more honest than language . To judge earnings ahead of time you look at what management is doing not_just what they ’ re saying . The fifth step is studying liquidity structure.The size of an earnings move is often driven by liquidity not_the actual numbers.Dark pool ratios liquidity pockets execution patterns algo flows and vacuum zones show you how much space the stock has to move.If there ’ s no_support below even a small miss can trigger back to back gaps.If liquidity is thin above a beat can cause an accelerated breakout . Understanding earnings ahead of time is about understanding market structure not_predicting the line items . In the end predicting earnings “ correctly ” isn ’ t about forecasting the numbers The most professional thing you can do before earnings is build your own framework around these five dimensions so you ’ re standing in front of the move instead of chasing it，When you can do that earnings day stops being a gamble . You ’ re not_guessing direction ， you ’ re trading the expectation gap.，You ’ re not_reacting ， you ’ re already positioned，The outcome doesn ’ t surprise you because the structure already told you the answer long before the numbers hit Final note this is just my personal view.If there ’ s anything I missed feel free to add on.And yeah it ’ s totally possible that me calling these last few earnings plays was just luck . But hopefully some of this can help even a little"

      "selftext": "Howdy! At the beginning of my investing career, so small mistakes are expected here and there. The situation: I bought SCHD since I heard it was a good dividend option; the problem is, I didn't buy it in a tax-advantaged account (like a 401K or Roth IRA) and instead bought it in a regular brokerage account. Not the end of the world since it only has about $1K USD dedicated to it, but I heard essentially you just end up paying a lot of taxes on it. I also heard that you really want to try to hold on to stocks for at least a year to avoid higher tax rates, but would it be fine to sell off + tank the short-term cost + reinvest in a better stock of my choice? Appreciate your thoughts!",

      "selftext_processed": "Howdy At the beginning of my investing career so small mistakes are expected here and there . The situation I bought SCHD since I heard it was a good dividend option the problem is I didnt buy it in a taxadvantaged account like a 401K or Roth IRA and instead bought it in a regular brokerage account . Not_the end of the world since it only has about $ 1K USD dedicated to it but I heard essentially you just end up paying a lot of taxes on it . I also heard that you really want to try to hold on to stocks for at least a year to avoid higher tax rates but would it be fine to sell off tank the shortterm cost reinvest in a better stock of my choice Appreciate your thoughts"

I missed the rally from 2021 onwards when Meta and other were at all time low. It seems like a very simple equation. **The more a brand people like and use frequently or obsessively, the more there is the possibility of it being higher priced in future**. I have seen this movie again and again since a decade. *AAPL - Apple stores are still full of folks and it just keeps on climbing despite no improvements in AI. People love it no matter what. *GOOG - Everyone is hooked on youtube and everyone has discovered their favorite subgenre/niche. The average watchtime on youtube keeps on increasing while networks and other formats suffer. Furthermore, the Gemini success with tensor chips will make Google most likely the AI leader MSFT - This is a curious case. The majority of consumers use and like it because it is available at multi price points. But Corporations overwhelmingly dont have any other choice except to integrate the whole windows ecosystem including docs, teams etc. The common folks don't have any idea how integral windows and its services is to like maybe 90% of companies. *AMZN - Keeps on breaking records every year with Amazon retail and AWS also keeps growing. It has been said time and again that while GCP and Azure are playing catch up, it is simply not possible for many companies to just replace their years old AWS stack with other alternatives. AWS is here to stay and grow (although maybe not at the pace as earlier) NFLX - With hopefully the WB catalog, this seems poised to be dominating households for a long long time. There is something there for everyone and anecdotal but yes I don't know a single friend or acquaintance who doesn't subscribe to Netflix. What do you guys think?",

      "selftext": "Costco on Thursday surpassed Wall Street’s quarterly expectations as its sales rose 8.2% year over year. The warehouse club does not share a full-year outlook. The company is expected to share more details about the quarter during an earnings call, which starts at 5 p.m. ET. Here’s how Costco did in its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $4.50 vs. $4.27 expected Revenue: $67.31 billion vs. $67.14 billion expected Costco has attracted new members and higher sales at its clubs and online as U.S. consumers across incomes seek value while shopping for groceries, household essentials, holiday gifts and more. Along with its warehouse club competitors, Costco has gained traction with younger customers who are signing up for memberships. Costco has also benefitted from a membership fee increase in the U.S. and Canada, which took effect in September 2024, and kicked in as new members signed up or as existing customers’ renewed their annual memberships when they lapsed. In the three-month period that ended Nov. 23, Costco’s net income rose to $2 billion, or $4.50 per share, from $1.80 billion, or $4.04 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased to $67.31 billion from $62.15 billion in the year-ago quarter. Comparable sales, an industry metric that takes out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and closures, increased 5.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% across the globe. Digital sales jumped by 20.5% year over year. Source:",

      "selftext": "The Fed's interest rate cut was expected, and Oracle's ORCL earnings report dragged down US AI and major tech stocks. ORCL's continued high debt, persistently negative free cash flow, and ever-increasing costs turned what was actually a good earnings report into a negative, causing a sharp drop in after-hours trading yesterday and dragging down major tech stocks today. I'm not optimistic about Oracle's AI path; it will ultimately not become a partner in OpenAI. After all, with a deep-pocketed company like Microsoft at the helm, it's clearly not the best choice for OpenAI. AI is expensive, requiring even more electricity than Bitcoin and is more delicate to maintain. This relates to what I wrote yesterday about Tesla's potential energy storage, something I said I'd discuss later, but I'll address it now. Let's start by simply explaining why AI needs electricity, and a lot of it at that. AI operation mainly consists of two parts, each consuming a large amount of electricity: The first part is model training, a very energy-intensive process. For example, training GPT5 once requires a huge amount of computation, necessitating tens of thousands of GPUs/TPUs running simultaneously for weeks or months. These GPUs continuously consume electricity and generate heat, requiring cooling. The second part is model inference. Every time a user asks a question, the model parameters are read, mathematical calculations are performed, and an answer is generated, all requiring electricity. Each user dialogue may involve tens to hundreds of watts of computation. The enormous electricity consumption has caused global concerns about electricity supply in the face of AI. Since electricity is the foundation of AI, major tech companies are investing in and exploring renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and tidal energy. I know that Google and Microsoft have invested in small nuclear reactors and nuclear fusion companies, respectively. Jensen Huang mentioned in a speech that the US may be filled with small nuclear companies in the future. So the conclusion is this: AI needs electricity, and the more powerful the AI, the more electricity it consumes. In fact, the future development speed of AI may depend on the power supply, rather than the algorithm itself. Having said all that, what more needs to be said about Tesla's energy storage? You should already understand my outlook on Tesla/Tesla energy storage; this is a subtle, understated approach. I often receive private messages asking about Tesla's prospects. If you don't understand an industry, don't invest in its stock. Of course, you might say you don't need to look at the financial statements; you can use the technical indicators (TA) for swing trading, which is another matter.",

      "selftext_processed": "The Feds interest rate cut was expected and Oracles ORCL earnings report dragged down US AI and major tech stocks . ORCLs continued high debt persistently negative free cash flow and everincreasing costs turned what was actually a good earnings report into a negative causing a sharp drop in afterhours trading yesterday and dragging down major tech stocks today . Im not_optimistic about Oracles AI path it will ultimately not_become a partner in OpenAI . After all with a deeppocketed company like Microsoft at the helm its clearly not_the best choice for OpenAI . AI is expensive requiring even more electricity than Bitcoin and is more delicate to maintain . This relates to what I wrote yesterday about Teslas potential energy storage something I said Id discuss later but Ill address it now . Lets start by simply explaining why AI needs electricity and a lot of it at that . AI operation mainly consists of two parts each consuming a large amount of electricity The first part is model training a very energyintensive process . For example training GPT5 once requires a huge amount of computation necessitating tens of thousands of GPUsTPUs running simultaneously for weeks or months . These GPUs continuously consume electricity and generate heat requiring cooling . The second part is model inference . Every time a user asks a question the model parameters are read mathematical calculations are performed and an answer is generated all requiring electricity . Each user dialogue may involve tens to hundreds of watts of computation . The enormous electricity consumption has caused global concerns about electricity supply in the face of AI . Since electricity is the foundation of AI major tech companies are investing in and exploring renewable energy sources such as solar wind geothermal and tidal energy . I know that Google and Microsoft have invested in small nuclear reactors and nuclear fusion companies respectively . Jensen Huang mentioned in a speech that the US may be filled with small nuclear companies in the future . So the conclusion is this AI needs electricity and the more powerful the AI the more electricity it consumes . In fact the future development speed of AI may depend on the power supply rather than the algorithm itself . Having said all that what more needs to be said about Teslas energy storage You should already understand my outlook on TeslaTesla energy storage this is a subtle understated approach . I often receive private messages asking about Teslas prospects . If you dont understand an industry dont invest in its stock . Of course you might say you dont need to look at the financial statements you can use the technical indicators TA for swing trading which is another matter ."

      "selftext": "Broadcom reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for earnings and revenue, and issued a strong forecast for the current quarter, driven by artificial intelligence demand. The stock rose 3% in extended trading on Thursday. Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG: Earnings per share: $1.95 adjusted vs. $1.86 estimated Revenue: $18.02 billion vs. $17.49 billion estimated Broadcom said revenue in the fiscal first quarter will be about $19.1 billion, which would represent 28% year-over-year growth, and is higher than the $18.3 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking. Net income climbed 97% to $8.51 billion, or $1.74 per share, from $4.32 billion, or 90 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Along with Nvidia, Broadcom has been the other major winner among U.S. semiconductor companies due to the AI boom. The company's stock price is up 75% so far in 2025, after doubling last year, as its custom chips, such as Google's tensor processing units, are gaining increasing traction in the market as a rival to Nvidia's graphics processing units. In June, Broadcom said it had three customers and four prospects for its custom AI chips. In September, it said it had a fourth mystery customer who had placed a $10 billion order for custom chips, and separately, announced a partnership with OpenAI in October to develop custom chips. Investors are closely watching to see Broadcom confirm that those companies are continuing to engage and are on-track to buy and deploy custom chips. Broadcom's overall revenue grew 28% during the quarter, which the company attributed largely to a 74% increase in AI chip sales, which would be equivalent to $8.2 billion in AI revenue during the fourth quarter. AI chip sales are reported in the company's semiconductor solutions business, which reported $11.07 billion in sales, up 22% on an annual basis, and topping StreetAccount's $10.77 billion estimate. Broadcom's other major segment, infrastructure software, reported 26% growth to $6.94 billion in sales, topping Wall Street's expectations. The segment includes sales from the company's VMWare offerings. Broadcom said that it would issue a per-share dividend of 65 cents, payable later this month, up from 59 cents.",

The stock rose 3 % in extended trading on Thursday . Heres how the company did compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG Earnings per share $ 1.95 adjusted vs. $ 1.86 estimated Revenue $ 18.02 billion vs. $ 17.49 billion estimated Broadcom said revenue in the fiscal first quarter will be about $ 19.1 billion which would represent 28 % yearoveryear growth and is higher than the $ 18.3 billion average analyst estimate according to LSEG . CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $ 8.2 billion both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking . Net income climbed 97 % to $ 8.51 billion or $ 1.74 per share from $ 4.32 billion or 90 cents per share in the yearago period . Along with Nvidia Broadcom has been the other major winner among U.S. semiconductor companies due to the AI boom . The companys stock price is up 75 % so far in 2025 after doubling last year as its custom chips such as Googles tensor processing units are gaining increasing traction in the market as a rival to Nvidias graphics processing units . In June Broadcom said it had three customers and four prospects for its custom AI chips . In September it said it had a fourth mystery customer who had placed a $ 10 billion order for custom chips and separately announced a partnership with OpenAI in October to develop custom chips . Investors are closely watching to see Broadcom confirm that those companies are continuing to engage and are ontrack to buy and deploy custom chips . Broadcoms overall revenue grew 28 % during the quarter which the company attributed largely to a 74 % increase in AI chip sales which would be equivalent to $ 8.2 billion in AI revenue during the fourth quarter . AI chip sales are reported in the companys semiconductor solutions business which reported $ 11.07 billion in sales up 22 % on an annual basis and topping StreetAccounts $ 10.77 billion estimate . Broadcoms other major segment infrastructure software reported 26 % growth to $ 6.94 billion in sales topping Wall Streets expectations . The segment includes sales from the companys VMWare offerings . Broadcom said that it would issue a pershare dividend of 65 cents payable later this month up from 59 cents ."

CRC kills roughly 935,000 people globally each year, while localized disease has \\~90% 5-year survival vs \\~13% when distant. If the next press release finally quantifies app-to-order conversion, completions, and median turnaround, the market can model real volume. Pooled next-gen performance is the anchor: \\~92% CRC sensitivity, \\~82% advanced adenomas, \\~95.8% high-grade dysplasia. For balance, keep Halozyme and Ligand on the list as platform names that translate partnerships into recurring revenue. If management puts hard DoctorBox numbers in the next update, that can move MYNZ from a watch to a starter position real quick. Not financial advice",

For balance keep Halozyme and Ligand on the list as platform names that translate partnerships into recurring revenue .

      "selftext": "Ok helping a friend out deciding something - this is in the USA. They currently have 100% equity in a rental house. Their purchase price was $132,000 plus around $65,000 worth of upgrades before it turned rental. Call it $200,000 even as their investment in this house. Rental house generates $2500/mo on average as a vacation rental. This does require some effort from him, but not a lot. Say 2-3 hours a week max to maintain the place and keep it ready for guests. Insurance is around $2000 a year, taxes are low. Since there's no mortgage, the only real costs are utilities (electric is very cheap) and insurance ($2000 a year). Taxes are cheap. So they are netting somewhere around $27-28,000 a year. Here's the thing we're trying to figure out: The house has appreciated greatly, from what we can tell, since they bought it 5 years back. Houses that are comparable in the area now sell in the $400,000's. He thinks they can get at least $400k for it, maybe more. There are already several people asking and two offers. This person is a decently learned trader who is up 50% this year on his investments. Their plan would be to take 2/3 of the money and put it in \"safe\" spots, ETF's, bonds, even just keep some in a HYS for a safety net. The other 1/3 would go in a family brokerage account to be used as more active trading capital. I do realize that the market has done great this year but this guy is also showing himself to be a decent trader who has had a few nice wins and is ahead overall since he started getting educated about it all. We figure that even at a very modest return per year of say 7%, that $400,000 would generate $28,000/yr ... is that not better to have the money working that way instead of having it tied up in a property? This property is definitely subject to fire and water issues (western USA) ... nothing yet but it feels very much in the cards. Insurance premiums are also skyrocketing as of late in the area. Is it a smart move to sell?",

      "selftext_processed": "Ok helping a friend out deciding something this is in the USA . They currently have 100 % equity in a rental house . Their purchase price was $ 132000 plus around $ 65000 worth of upgrades before it turned rental . Call it $ 200000 even as their investment in this house . Rental house generates $ 2500mo on average as a vacation rental . This does require some effort from him but not_a lot . Say 23 hours a week max to maintain the place and keep it ready for guests . Insurance is around $ 2000 a year taxes are low . Since theres no_mortgage the only real costs are utilities electric is very cheap and insurance $ 2000 a year . Taxes are cheap . So they are netting somewhere around $ 2728000 a year . Heres the thing were trying to figure out The house has appreciated greatly from what we can tell since they bought it 5 years back . Houses that are comparable in the area now sell in the $ 400000s . He thinks they can get at least $ 400k for it maybe more . There are already several people asking and two offers . This person is a decently learned trader who is up 50 % this year on his investments . Their plan would be to take 23 of the money and put it in safe spots ETFs bonds even just keep some in a HYS for a safety net . The other 13 would go in a family brokerage account to be used as more active trading capital . I do realize that the market has done great this year but this guy is also showing himself to be a decent trader who has had a few nice wins and is ahead overall since he started getting educated about it all . We figure that even at a very modest return per year of say 7 % that $ 400000 would generate $ 28000yr ... is that not_better to have the money working that way instead of having it tied up in a property This property is definitely subject to fire and water issues western USA ... nothing_yet but it feels very much in the cards . Insurance premiums are also skyrocketing as of late in the area . Is it a smart move to sell"

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Shares of financial services company Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) fell 9.1% in the morning session after the company reported weak operating data for November 2025, showing declines in funded customers and trading volumes. >The report revealed that trading volumes for equities dropped by 37% from the previous month, while options and crypto trading fell by 28% and 12%, respectively. The number of funded customers also decreased, partly due to the removal of about 280,000 low-balance accounts. Adding to the pressure, Connecticut's Department of Consumer Protection recently issued a cease-and-desist order to Robinhood for allegedly conducting unlicensed online gambling operations. In response to the developments, analysts at Bank of America Securities and Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their price forecasts on the stock. >What Is The Market Telling Us >Robinhood’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 60 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. >The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 2.8% on the news that the company announced its entry into the Indonesian market as it agreed to acquire a local brokerage and a digital asset trader. >The U.S. retail brokerage entered into agreements to purchase PT Buana Capital Sekuritas and PT Pedagang Aset Kripto. This move marked Robinhood's entry into Southeast Asia's largest market, which has over 19 million capital market investors and 17 million crypto traders. The expansion was part of the company's broader international growth strategy throughout 2025. The deals were subject to approval by Indonesia's Financial Services Authority, with the company stating completion was expected in the first half of 2026. Investor reaction was optimistic, seeing the move as a significant step to tap into a fast-growing market for both stock and crypto trading. >Robinhood is up 215% since the beginning of the year, but at $124.09 per share, it is still trading 18.6% below its 52-week high of $152.46 from October 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Robinhood’s shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $3,564.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Shares of financial services company Robinhood NASDAQHOOD fell 9.1 % in the morning session after the company reported weak operating data for November 2025 showing declines in funded customers and trading volumes . The report revealed that trading volumes for equities dropped by 37 % from the previous month while options and crypto trading fell by 28 % and 12 % respectively . The number of funded customers also decreased partly due to the removal of about 280000 lowbalance accounts . Adding to the pressure Connecticuts Department of Consumer Protection recently issued a ceaseanddesist order to Robinhood for allegedly conducting unlicensed online gambling operations . In response to the developments analysts at Bank of America Securities and Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their price forecasts on the stock . What Is The Market Telling Us Robinhood ’ s shares are extremely volatile and have had 60 moves greater than 5 % over the last year . In that context today ’ s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not_something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business . The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 2.8 % on the news that the company announced its entry into the Indonesian market as it agreed to acquire a local brokerage and a digital asset trader . The U.S. retail brokerage entered into agreements to purchase PT Buana Capital Sekuritas and PT Pedagang Aset Kripto . This move marked Robinhoods entry into Southeast Asias largest market which has over 19 million capital market investors and 17 million crypto traders . The expansion was part of the companys broader international growth strategy throughout 2025 . The deals were subject to approval by Indonesias Financial Services Authority with the company stating completion was expected in the first half of 2026 . Investor reaction was optimistic seeing the move as a significant step to tap into a fastgrowing market for both stock and crypto trading . Robinhood is up 215 % since the beginning of the year but at $ 124.09 per share it is still trading 18.6 % below its 52week high of $ 152.46 from October 2025 . Investors who bought $ 1000 worth of Robinhood ’ s shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $ 3564 ."

      "title": "A deep dive into RKLB's backlog and burn rate: Is this stock the next SpaceX or a value trap? My in-depth valuation model.",
      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I've been following Rocket Lab (RKLB) for over two years. The recent dramatic stock price fluctuations have made me re-evaluate the company's fundamentals. I've noticed that most discussions about RKLB on Reddit focus on emotional outbursts about \"To the Moon\" or the cult of personality surrounding Peter Beck, with few people actually sitting down to do the math. To verify whether the current valuation is reasonable, I spent two weeks building a very detailed DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) valuation model based on their latest earnings call, backlog conversion rates, and the potential launch cadence of the Neutron rocket. I want to share a few counterintuitive conclusions from the model, hoping to spark some rational discussion: 1. Space Systems is the real moat, not the launch business. Everyone is focused on when Neutron will make its maiden flight, but my data shows that RKLB's Space Systems division (solar panels, reactor wheels, etc.) is actually growing faster than the potential ceiling of the launch business. The market seems to see RKLB merely as a \"smaller SpaceX,\" ignoring its potential as a \"prime of space infrastructure.\" My model shows that even if Neutron is delayed by 12 months, as long as the space system maintains its current growth rate, the downside potential for the stock price is locked in. 2. Burn Rate and Dilution Risk This is the issue bulls least want to face. I simulated three scenarios: Optimistic Scenario: Neutron successfully commercializes in 2025. Neutral Scenario: Technical delays occur, requiring additional financing. Pessimistic Scenario: A collapse similar to Astra's. In my \"neutral\" model, RKLB may face a funding gap of approximately $300-500 million before 2026. This implies potential equity dilution. However, if they can secure a few specific government contracts (I've listed the contract codes and projected amounts in the model), this gap will disappear. 3. Institutional Investor Movements I analyzed 13F filings from the past two quarters and found that while retail investors are panicking, some institutions focused on deep tech are actually quietly increasing their positions. This is often a bottoming signal, but it could also mean a multi-year consolidation phase. Conclusion and Discussion: Based on current price fluctuations, I believe market pricing is extremely inefficient. It's either severely undervalued (if Neutron delivers on time) or overvalued (if the bottomless pit of capital expenditures is ignored). Regarding my model data: This Excel model is very large, containing detailed quarterly revenue forecasts, sensitivity analysis charts, and specific formulas for my assumptions regarding Neutron launch margins. Simply pasting it directly into a Reddit post would result in a messy and unreadable format. However, I strongly encourage knowledgeable individuals to challenge my assumptions (Bear Case). If you are interested in specific backlog conversion rate data; or want to see my projected 2026 EBITDA forecast; or want to run my Excel model against your own assumptions; please feel free to point this out in the comments, and we can discuss these specific figures in more depth. I'm curious about everyone's views on the actual impact of Neutron's delays on cash flow. Am I being too pessimistic?",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone Ive been following Rocket Lab RKLB for over two years . The recent dramatic stock price fluctuations have made me reevaluate the companys fundamentals . Ive noticed that most discussions about RKLB on Reddit focus on emotional outbursts about To the Moon or the cult of personality surrounding Peter Beck with few people actually sitting down to do the math . To verify whether the current valuation is reasonable I spent two weeks building a very detailed DCF Discounted Cash Flow valuation model based on their latest earnings call backlog conversion rates and the potential launch cadence of the Neutron rocket . I want to share a few counterintuitive conclusions from the model hoping to spark some rational discussion 1 . Space Systems is the real moat not_the launch business . Everyone is focused on when Neutron will make its maiden flight but my data shows that RKLBs Space Systems division solar panels reactor wheels etc . is actually growing faster than the potential ceiling of the launch business . The market seems to see RKLB merely as a smaller SpaceX ignoring its potential as a prime of space infrastructure . My model shows that even if Neutron is delayed by 12 months as long as the space system maintains its current growth rate the downside potential for the stock price is locked in . 2 . Burn Rate and Dilution Risk This is the issue bulls least want to face . I simulated three scenarios Optimistic Scenario Neutron successfully commercializes in 2025 . Neutral Scenario Technical delays occur requiring additional financing . Pessimistic Scenario A collapse similar to Astras . In my neutral model RKLB may face a funding gap of approximately $ 300500 million before 2026 . This implies potential equity dilution . However if they can secure a few specific government contracts Ive listed the contract codes and projected amounts in the model this gap will disappear . 3 . Institutional Investor Movements I analyzed 13F filings from the past two quarters and found that while retail investors are panicking some institutions focused on deep tech are actually quietly increasing their positions . This is often a bottoming signal but it could also mean a multiyear consolidation phase . Conclusion and Discussion Based on current price fluctuations I believe market pricing is extremely inefficient . Its either severely undervalued if Neutron delivers on time or overvalued if the bottomless pit of capital expenditures is ignored . Regarding my model data This Excel model is very large containing detailed quarterly revenue forecasts sensitivity analysis charts and specific formulas for my assumptions regarding Neutron launch margins . Simply pasting it directly into a Reddit post would result in a messy and unreadable format . However I strongly encourage knowledgeable individuals to challenge my assumptions Bear Case . If you are interested in specific backlog conversion rate data or want to see my projected 2026 EBITDA forecast or want to run my Excel model against your own assumptions please feel free to point this out in the comments and we can discuss these specific figures in more depth . Im curious about everyones views on the actual impact of Neutrons delays on cash flow . Am I being too pessimistic"

      "selftext": "The Fed’s latest move makes it pretty clear which side of the mandate is getting more attention right now. At his press conference, Powell repeated several times that recent job growth may actually be negative once revisions come in. That’s a pretty notable shift in tone and it suggests the committee is getting increasingly worried about the labor market softening more than expected. With inflation cooling but not fully settled, the Fed is trying to walk a very narrow path. Wednesday’s rate cut was framed as part of that balancing act: easing enough to prevent further deterioration in employment, but not so much that they risk re-accelerating prices. How they manage this trade-off is likely going to define policy through 2026, especially if more data starts confirming labor weakness. The broader question now is whether the Fed thinks the economy can handle weaker job numbers without slipping into something more serious, or whether this is the first sign of a longer adjustment ahead.

      "selftext": "SpaceX’s path to a public listing got a little clearer after Elon Musk said the recent reports about a 2026 IPO are “accurate.” Several outlets had already noted that the company completed a secondary share sale valuing it near $800 billion, and the timing of that deal naturally fueled speculation about next steps. A public listing would mark a major shift for SpaceX, which has stayed private far longer than most companies of its scale. Investors have been watching closely to see when Musk might open the door to outside shareholders, but there are still plenty of questions about how a business built around long-term, capital-intensive projects will be received by the public markets. For now, nothing is formally announced, but Musk’s brief acknowledgment is the strongest signal yet that SpaceX is preparing for a transition that would reshape both the company and the broader space industry.

A public listing would mark a major shift for SpaceX which has stayed private far longer than most companies of its scale . Investors have been watching closely to see when Musk might open the door to outside shareholders but there are still plenty of questions about how a business built around longterm capitalintensive projects will be received by the public markets . For now nothing_is formally announced but Musk ’ s brief acknowledgment is the strongest signal yet that SpaceX is preparing for a transition that would reshape both the company and the broader space industry .

He asked about getting a credit card to buy stocks and I flat out told him not to go into credit card debt to buy any stocks, especially when starting out.

      "selftext": "Nvidia is seeing a wave of positive sentiment after analysts pointed out new export approvals for its H200 chips going to China. Bank of America reiterated its buy rating, while Wells Fargo flagged the significance of these approvals in maintaining Nvidia’s position in markets affected by U.S. China restrictions. Another interesting development is Nvidia’s new GPU tracking system, which appears designed to address ongoing geopolitical concerns about chip flows. It’s a reminder that Nvidia isn’t just selling hardware anymore it’s increasingly operating in a regulatory environment where transparency tools can influence policy decisions. Analysts continue to emphasize how central Nvidia chips are to China’s AI ambitions, even within tightened export rules. The market seems to recognize that despite restrictions, demand hasn’t evaporated it’s just getting reshaped. Given the volatility around chip export news lately, do you see this as a durable sentiment shift or just a short-term bounce?",

      "selftext": "Microsoft is dealing with a mix of legal pressure and expansion news this week. The company was hit with a $2.8 billion lawsuit accusing it of overcharging for cloud licenses something regulators have been raising questions about for years now. That overshadowed what should’ve been a positive update from Satya Nadella, who announced a sizable investment in India alongside deeper AI integration into Dynamics 365. Despite the broader tech sell-off, MSFT only dipped around 0.9%, which suggests investors are still placing more weight on long-term AI positioning than on the legal noise. But the lawsuit does highlight a recurring vulnerability for Microsoft: regulators and competitors regularly push back against its cloud pricing structure. The bigger strategic picture is that Microsoft continues doubling down on enterprise AI adoption, even as the regulatory environment gets tighter. Curious if anyone thinks this lawsuit meaningfully changes the cloud landscape, or if it’s just another chapter in a long-running dispute.",

      "title": "Tesla gets hit with another downgrade as chip supply risks return into focus",
      "selftext": "Tesla’s latest downgrade from Morgan Stanley brings renewed attention to something the market hasn’t talked about much lately chip supply constraints. The bank cut its rating to Equal Weight while still raising the price target to $425, which is an interesting signal: analysts don’t see TSLA collapsing, but they’re also not confident enough about near-term execution to call it undervalued. The core issue seems to be lingering uncertainty around chip availability and delivery timelines, especially as Tesla tries to scale multiple initiatives at once (FSD, energy, robotics, manufacturing revamps). Even with projected growth, analysts appear cautious about whether Tesla can maintain delivery consistency heading into 2026. It’s another reminder that Tesla’s biggest challenges aren’t always demand-related sometimes the bottlenecks sit deeper in the supply chain. Would be interested to hear how others see the risk here. Is this just typical year-end conservatism from analysts, or something more structural?",

The bank cut its rating to Equal Weight while still raising the price target to $ 425 which is an interesting signal analysts don ’ t see TSLA collapsing but they ’ re also not_confident enough about nearterm execution to call it undervalued . The core issue seems to be lingering uncertainty around chip availability and delivery timelines especially as Tesla tries to scale multiple initiatives at once FSD energy robotics manufacturing revamps . Even with projected growth analysts appear cautious about whether Tesla can maintain delivery consistency heading into 2026 . It ’ s another reminder that Tesla ’ s biggest challenges aren ’ t always demandrelated sometimes the bottlenecks sit deeper in the supply chain . Would be interested to hear how others see the risk here . Is this just typical yearend conservatism from analysts or something more structural"

      "selftext": "Most of you have probably seen the report/highlights. For those who did not, TLDR: revenue slightly missed estimates, capex surged, resulting in negative FCF (-$10 billion). ORCL is -12.5% as I write these words, SP500 is flat. I wonder when the market starts paying attention to the AI capex problem (or is it a real problem at all?). It's a big question given the market's dependence on Mag7 and the AI story in general. At the same time, Fed has already decided to start buying shorter-term Treasury securities and is probably just one step away from a full QE. I wonder if QE makes investors forget about anything else so that the market can tolerate a few quarters of so-so reports (due to surging capex) from tech and keep testing new highs.",

I did some research and while it’s legal to hold onto the funds until the next year tax filing season, which is what the employer is doing, a safe Harbor basic match plan has to be 100% vested. I found my 401(k) contract and it states the same thing. I understand what 100% vested means in general. My question is, does vested only mean that the money is guaranteed to be mine (for whatever is earned of course) or does it have to be deposited into the account? Myself and any co-workers lose the opportunity for that money to grow for possibly almost a 16-17 months?",

I found my 401k contract and it states the same thing . I understand what 100 % vested means in general . My question is does vested only mean that the money is guaranteed to be mine for whatever is earned of course or does it have to be deposited into the account Myself and any coworkers lose the opportunity for that money to grow for possibly almost a 1617 months"

It often holds through the drop instead of selling right into the lows, so it’s still holding when prices recover. * **It leans toward stronger fundamentals rather than pure hype.** Over multiple episodes it tends to favor companies with more solid business profiles, instead of chasing whatever is moving the most that day. * **It adds gradually when “good” names get cheaper.** On sharp down days, it sometimes scales in slowly to higher‑quality names at lower prices, rather than joining the exit.

They then agree to share a portion of the shares or profits with the investors based on the amount invested. That is what I thought it was but then I see articles saying that the partner owns no shares and agrees to share profits. So isn't that the same thing a share of the profits based on shares of Chinese stocks sold? What is to prevent this third party partner in the Caymen Islands from keeping the profits for themselves, making up fake statements for clients or going bankrupt? Where is the protection? Who would an investor complain to?",

      "selftext": "Are we already living through another industrial-scale labor shift, or are the fears around AI way ahead of reality? That’s the debate resurfacing after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that AI is “not a big part of the story” in the labor market right now even if it’s probably starting to play a role around the edges. Powell’s comments clash with what a lot of workers are feeling. Executives across tech, finance, media, and even manufacturing have been unusually open about how they expect AI to reshape job structures, cut headcount, or automate entire workflows. That messaging alone has created a sense of uncertainty, even if the actual economic data hasn’t yet shown large-scale displacement. Right now, most of the labor market slowdown seems tied to broader macro pressures cautious companies, weaker demand, and delayed hiring not directly to AI. But the fear that the next wave of automation could arrive faster than previous cycles is still very real for a lot of people. Curious where everyone here stands: Do you think Powell is right and AI’s impact is still small? Or are we underestimating how quickly AI is starting to reshape work behind the scenes? Source: [",

Analysts say the metal’s recent strength comes from its “dual identity”: it’s used heavily in industries like solar, electronics and EVs, while also serving as a store of value similar to gold. Market watchers told CNBC that both sides of the demand story are heating up at the same time industrial consumption is rising, and investors are increasing allocations to precious metals as economic uncertainty lingers. Some analysts even expect silver could move past $100 per ounce by the end of next year, though opinions are still divided on how sustainable the current pace is.

      "selftext_processed": "Spot silver crossed $ 62 per ounce on Wednesday marking a new record high . Analysts say the metal ’ s recent strength comes from its “ dual identity ” it ’ s used heavily in industries like solar electronics and EVs while also serving as a store of value similar to gold . Market watchers told CNBC that both sides of the demand story are heating up at the same time industrial consumption is rising and investors are increasing allocations to precious metals as economic uncertainty lingers . Some analysts even expect silver could move past $ 100 per ounce by the end of next year though opinions are still divided on how sustainable the current pace is . Curious how others here view silver at these levels is this just the start or are price forecasts getting ahead of fundamentals Source"

      "selftext": "On the spam midfield that is yahoo finance news feed I noticed yesterday that the majority on analysts see MSTR as a buy or strong buy and one of the price targets was over 700 dollars a share. To me it seems like a house of cards for several reasons. 1.) If bitcoin drops lower than their cost basis all they have done is spend billions on a bad asset. Like a REIT buying an apartment complex and finding it's all covered in black mold. 2.) Saylor is trying so hard to appear fearless it should be scaring people. If his playbook is to keep issuing new shares and diluting to buy more bitcoin as the price collapses he needs a new playbook. 3.) IMO the potential downward spiral of a company is much faster if the only product the company has is its share price. And if the driver for that share price is a super volatile asset that's on a huge losing streak. 4.) The preferred stock with absurd dividends seems like an overconfident bet vs. a sustainable business strategy. (pun intended) If the bull case is bitcoin ONLY goes up over the long term I can understand that. But crypto is not the S and P or gold and it's history is short enough I couldn't sleep at night if that was my only reason for holding MSTR. I'm am legitimately curious what I'm missing. This post is my effort to learn new things. I don't have any money on either side of this stock and honestly both sides scare me.",

I understand there's overlap/concentration in big cap tech, but I feel we're a little behind so I want a growth focus yet wanted to give it a value tilt. I expect the Mag 7/AI to correct but also have a healthy rebound and still do well over that time period. BMNR is my wildcard. Background: This is a traditional rollover IRA. I am rolling over $100k from a previous job into the account. I have positions in these funds now and have set the $100k to be automatically invested each week into FZROX, QQQM, and QUAL over the next year, so these will be the final allocations. I'm assuming the market will be a little volatile over the next year which is why I decided to DCA instead of just lump it in (I know some prefer to just lump sum but this strategy is not up for debate since this is what my wife prefers)",

I understand theres overlapconcentration in big cap tech but I feel were a little behind so I want a growth focus yet wanted to give it a value tilt . I expect the Mag 7AI to correct but also have a healthy rebound and still do well over that time period . BMNR is my wildcard . Background This is a traditional rollover IRA . I am rolling over $ 100k from a previous job into the account . I have positions in these funds now and have set the $ 100k to be automatically invested each week into FZROX QQQM and QUAL over the next year so these will be the final allocations . Im assuming the market will be a little volatile over the next year which is why I decided to DCA instead of just lump it in I know some prefer to just lump sum but this strategy is not_up for debate since this is what my wife prefers"

      "selftext": "The sentiment in the U.S. stock market has been somewhat nuanced these past few days. On the surface, Oracle's earnings report where cloud revenue fell short of expectations and AI capital expenditures surged again dragged down the entire tech sector. But digging deeper reveals the market's true concern: the first wave of valuation repricing as AI investment shifts from “dream driven” to “cash flow reality.” Over the past year, the AI theme has been virtually the sole driver of the U.S. stock market. From computing power to data centers, from GPUs to optical modules, from large models to application end solutions, the entire chain operated on the principle: “If you dare to invest, I dare to rise.” The problem is when a company projects its next two years of capital expenditures to reach $50 billion, the market is asking for the first time: When will this money translate into actual revenue? Thus, the broader pressure on tech stocks this time around seems unsurprising to me. The S&P and Nasdaq corrected, AI heavyweight stocks weakened in tandem, and Bitcoin followed sentiment lower. Capital began withdrawing from high valuation, high expectation sectors, seeking more stable assets. Even the Fed's recent “hawkish yet dovish” rate cut combination failed to fully shore up market sentiment. Interestingly, the shift from fervor to caution in AI investment doesn't signal an industry peak. On the contrary, it underscores a crucial point: AI isn't dead. The market has finally recognized this isn't a quick victory but a protracted battle of attrition. Factors like sustained investment capacity, robust balance sheets, and genuine customer demand are rapidly gaining importance. Yet another perspective warrants attention: the Fed's signals indicate that rate cuts are not unconditional, but rather a cautious maneuver following inflation's retreat and growth stabilization. This implies markets must reprice the relationship between interest rates, growth, and risk appetite. While rates are declining, their trajectory is no longer linear this “slow bull market easing” actually benefits non AI sectors. A broader view reveals: AI themes remain robust, but the era of “buying blindly” has passed. Tech giants are entering a capital intensive phase where massive capital expenditures demand clear return pathways to investors. Meanwhile, investors are shifting from “story driven valuations” to “cash flow driven valuations.” The AI war rages on, but it's now entering the era of the ledger. The future winners may not be the best storytellers, but rather those who can pour $50 billion into development while maintaining profit margins. The true threshold in the AI era has shifted from models to cash flow, from technological narratives to capital endurance races. This correction may well be the first warning signal before a new order emerges.",

      "selftext_processed": "The sentiment in the U.S. stock market has been somewhat nuanced these past few days . On the surface Oracles earnings report where cloud revenue fell short of expectations and AI capital expenditures surged again dragged down the entire tech sector . But digging deeper reveals the markets true concern the first wave of valuation repricing as AI investment shifts from “ dream driven ” to “ cash flow reality. ” Over the past year the AI theme has been virtually the sole driver of the U.S. stock market . From computing power to data centers from GPUs to optical modules from large models to application end solutions the entire chain operated on the principle “ If you dare to invest I dare to rise. ” The problem is when a company projects its next two years of capital expenditures to reach $ 50 billion the market is asking for the first time When will this money translate into actual revenue Thus the broader pressure on tech stocks this time around seems unsurprising to me . The SP and Nasdaq corrected AI heavyweight stocks weakened in tandem and Bitcoin followed sentiment lower . Capital began withdrawing from high valuation high expectation sectors seeking more stable assets . Even the Feds recent “ hawkish yet dovish ” rate cut combination failed to fully shore up market sentiment . Interestingly the shift from fervor to caution in AI investment doesnt signal an industry peak . On the contrary it underscores a crucial point AI isnt dead . The market has finally recognized this isnt a quick victory but a protracted battle of attrition . Factors like sustained investment capacity robust balance sheets and genuine customer demand are rapidly gaining importance . Yet another perspective warrants attention the Feds signals indicate that rate cuts are not_unconditional but rather a cautious maneuver following inflations retreat and growth stabilization . This implies markets must reprice the relationship between interest rates growth and risk appetite . While rates are declining their trajectory is no_longer linear this “ slow bull market easing ” actually benefits non AI sectors . A broader view reveals AI themes remain robust but the era of “ buying blindly ” has passed . Tech giants are entering a capital intensive phase where massive capital expenditures demand clear return pathways to investors . Meanwhile investors are shifting from “ story driven valuations ” to “ cash flow driven valuations. ” The AI war rages on but its now entering the era of the ledger . The future winners may not_be the best storytellers but rather those who can pour $ 50 billion into development while maintaining profit margins . The true threshold in the AI era has shifted from models to cash flow from technological narratives to capital endurance races . This correction may well be the first warning signal before a new order emerges ."

Visa (V) shares rose 1.3% in premarket trading on Thursday. Since October 10, the stock has declined \\~5.1%, while the S&P 500 index has gained 5.1%. The stock's current valuation approaches a decade low amid excessive disruption fears and rotation into AI/risk stocks. “I view this as an attractive opportunity to own one of the world's best companies at reasonable multiples,” Bank of America stated, adding that the $38 billion merchant settlement and regulatory risks should not fundamentally undermine Visa's (V) robust fundamentals. Furthermore, stablecoins represent an opportunity rather than a threat to the company and are likely to enhance its position. Meanwhile, Visa (V) is one of only six S&P 500 companies to achieve 10%+ revenue growth, double digit EPS growth, and an operating margin >50% over the past year, and one of just two companies to have delivered these metrics annually since 2021.",

The problem is that they show everything so differently that I can't even compare properly, fidelity has all these charts and tables that look professional I guess but are kind of confusing, robinhood is super clean and simple but missing a bunch of info I actually need. Neither one gives me a real picture of my total portfolio allocation or how I'm doing overall. I tried adding everything up manually in my head but that lasted maybe two days before I realized I was spending way too much time on basic math, is everyone else just picking one brokerage and sticking with it or is there actually a good way to see everything together without building some crazy spreadsheet, because honestly I'm not trying to become an excel expert just to track my investments you know.",

The problem is that they show everything so differently that I cant even compare properly fidelity has all these charts and tables that look professional I guess but are kind of confusing robinhood is super clean and simple but missing a bunch of info I actually need . Neither_one gives me a real picture of my total portfolio allocation or how Im doing overall . I tried adding everything up manually in my head but that lasted maybe two days before I realized I was spending way too much time on basic math is everyone else just picking one brokerage and sticking with it or is there actually a good way to see everything together without building some crazy spreadsheet because honestly Im not_trying to become an excel expert just to track my investments you know ."

      "selftext": "During the 2008 financial crisis the housing bubble burst because of mortgages to unqualified borrowers, complex financial products like mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and lax lending standards. So, a faulty system depending on we, the people, paying off mortgages and loans that were not being paid back. Seems a logical cause for a bubble to burst. Before, the dotcom bubble bursted because of extreme overvaluation of companies, which were not performing up to the expectations, so the revenue wasn't there. Now there is obviously an AI bubble as has been pointed out many many times, but currently the companies involved are still meeting their expected revenue goals (looking at NVIDIA, Meta, Google even though that is not strictly an AI-related company, their current valuation is also due to their AI developments). Of course, investing in each other and buying each other's products, causing stocks to rise, is super inflatory, but is not punished so far. It seems. Now, a geopolitical conflict involving a certain chipmaker to not be able to produce would likely pop the bubble overnight. Given the current geopolitical situation and the people involved, this is not unlikely in the coming years. But as long as this doesn't happen it appears to be business as usual, and the AI-race will continue. Now, comparing this to earlier bubbles, the pattern is similar. An industry is pumped to the moon, a bunch of people make an insane amount of money, the bubble bursts and most people get screwed over with a few winners. The question is always: how high will it go when the companies are profitable and how deep will the lows be? As a retail investor who is not trading daily, this situation is extremely difficult and hard to predict when also just having a regular 9 to 5 job. I know I won't be able to predict it, so it is a risk analysis whether the current valuations will be the future lows OR if big companies with PE ratios of 50 are already a selling sign for the retail investor. This would even apply to ETFs like VWRL, since their share of NVDA is also high. The whole market will likely go down when this bubble bursts, just some companies more than others. given earlier arguments, I feel like going short here is stupid. Thereby, world governments are hedging inflation (buying loads of gold), which also has geopolitical implications. Now I believe in the mantra that time in the market beats timing the market but probably needing the money in 3 years or so, the current situation is a spicy sauce. It seems like hedging inflation (e.g. buying gold and funds like Berkshire) is not a bad move.",

      "selftext_processed": "During the 2008 financial crisis the housing bubble burst because of mortgages to unqualified borrowers complex financial products like mortgagebacked securities MBS and lax lending standards . So a faulty system depending on we the people paying off mortgages and loans that were not_being paid back . Seems a logical cause for a bubble to burst . Before the dotcom bubble bursted because of extreme overvaluation of companies which were not_performing up to the expectations so the revenue wasnt there . Now there is obviously an AI bubble as has been pointed out many many times but currently the companies involved are still meeting their expected revenue goals looking at NVIDIA Meta Google even though that is not_strictly an AIrelated company their current valuation is also due to their AI developments . Of course investing in each other and buying each others products causing stocks to rise is super inflatory but is not_punished so far . It seems . Now a geopolitical conflict involving a certain chipmaker to not_be able to produce would likely pop the bubble overnight . Given the current geopolitical situation and the people involved this is not_unlikely in the coming years . But as long as this doesnt happen it appears to be business as usual and the AIrace will continue . Now comparing this to earlier bubbles the pattern is similar . An industry is pumped to the moon a bunch of people make an insane amount of money the bubble bursts and most people get screwed over with a few winners . The question is always how high will it go when the companies are profitable and how deep will the lows be As a retail investor who is not_trading daily this situation is extremely difficult and hard to predict when also just having a regular 9 to 5 job . I know I wont be able to predict it so it is a risk analysis whether the current valuations will be the future lows OR if big companies with PE ratios of 50 are already a selling sign for the retail investor . This would even apply to ETFs like VWRL since their share of NVDA is also high . The whole market will likely go down when this bubble bursts just some companies more than others . given earlier arguments I feel like going short here is stupid . Thereby world governments are hedging inflation buying loads of gold which also has geopolitical implications . Now I believe in the mantra that time in the market beats timing the market but probably needing the money in 3 years or so the current situation is a spicy sauce . It seems like hedging inflation e.g . buying gold and funds like Berkshire is not_a bad move ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been keeping an eye on FLWS and, honestly, it’s one of the few tickers where the numbers actually make sense for a potential squeeze setup. Short interest is sitting around 9.4M shares, which is roughly 31% of the float, and the days to cover is still up near 17. Those are real exchange-reported numbers, not the made-up stuff people throw around on Reddit. What’s interesting is what’s been happening with volume. A few of the recent trading days finally showed signs of life after months of barely any liquidity. It wasn’t explosive, but enough to show that the stock isn’t completely dead. When you’ve got short interest that high and a float that isn’t huge, even small jumps in volume matter. If the volume keeps picking up the way it has the past few sessions, it puts actual pressure on shorts instead of just theoretical pressure. FLWS isn’t a broken company either. They’re still doing around $2B in revenue and they don’t have some catastrophic debt problem. It’s more like the market forgot about the stock, and that’s usually when shorts get overly comfortable. High days to cover plus a bit of returning volume is the kind of combination that actually changes things. If the volume continues building the way it has recently, it could get interesting pretty quickly. Just sharing my read based on the real numbers. Not advice.",

I'm normally very much an index and chill investor but keep some money on the side to play with and the stock is really taking my fancy recently. UNITE Group plc currently training at 0.53 of its book value, the stock price is decreased almost 40% in the last year largely due to concerns over acquisitions, lower forecasts for next year's occupancy (down to 93%) and increased cost of servicing it's debt. The price to book value is what originally got me interested, but even following negative guidance for next year (11% drop in revenue). The stock trades at a forward PE of 11 with a forward dividend yield of 7.22% at current price. I believe the finances of the company suggest that the dividend is 'safe' moving forward. I am also bullish over student accommodation in the UK as an industry and whilst they appreciate there is a number of current challenges (increased tax burden on a foreign students, decrease in applications in some areas) I believe this has largely been overblown and UNITE's focus on Russel Group universities with high demand reinforces this. I would value anyone's thoughts on the stock and potential risks which I might want to be investigating as I move through my next steps.",

      "selftext": "I'm trying to understand why Planet Labs (PL) seems to get significantly less hype and investor attention compared to companies like Rocket Lab (RKLB) or AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), even though Planet Labs has real revenues, growing customer base, strong financial results, and multi-year government contracts. Given their solid financial results, positive EBITDA, backlog growth, and increasing gross margins, why is the market perception and share price still much lower than some of the more “story-driven” space companies? What factors make PL less “sexy” in the eyes of investors despite having a more stable and fundamental business model?",

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking a lot about how to properly measure whether I’m any good at this, beyond just looking at my portfolio balance going up or down. For context, over the last 5 years I’ve averaged 31.5% per year, holding around 20 stocks at any given time, split across two countries. I usually only have one “Magnificent 7” name at most, the rest is mostly mid- and small-caps. My average holding period is about 8 months, but I do adjust position sizes for risk management and take the occasional swing trade when it makes sense. My lowest low was -30% during 6 months. My framework is a mix of macro themes, cultural trends, and retail sentiment. Now, obviously those returns sound good on paper. But I also know survivorship bias, bull-market tailwinds, luck, volatility exposure, and concentrated bets can distort the picture. So I’m curious how you all think about benchmarking yourselves: - Do you compare everything to the S&P 500 or another major index? (I tend to compare myself vs Nasdaq US) - If you invest internationally, do you use blended benchmarks? - Do you adjust for risk, volatility, drawdowns, or turnover? - Is there a point where comparing to broad indices stops making sense if your style is very different? - And what time horizon is actually meaningful; 3 years? 5? 10? Basically: how do you know if you genuinely have skill, or if you’re just surfing a wave? I’d be really interested to hear how others approach this, especially those who don’t just buy index funds but also aren’t full-time traders.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been thinking a lot about how to properly measure whether I ’ m any good at this beyond just looking at my portfolio balance going up or down . For context over the last 5 years I ’ ve averaged 31.5 % per year holding around 20 stocks at any given time split across two countries . I usually only have one “ Magnificent 7 ” name at most the rest is mostly mid and smallcaps . My average holding period is about 8 months but I do adjust position sizes for risk management and take the occasional swing trade when it makes sense . My lowest low was 30 % during 6 months . My framework is a mix of macro themes cultural trends and retail sentiment . Now obviously those returns sound good on paper . But I also know survivorship bias bullmarket tailwinds luck volatility exposure and concentrated bets can distort the picture . So I ’ m curious how you all think about benchmarking yourselves Do you compare everything to the SP 500 or another major index I tend to compare myself vs Nasdaq US If you invest internationally do you use blended benchmarks Do you adjust for risk volatility drawdowns or turnover Is there a point where comparing to broad indices stops making sense if your style is very different And what time horizon is actually meaningful 3 years 5 10 Basically how do you know if you genuinely have skill or if you ’ re just surfing a wave I ’ d be really interested to hear how others approach this especially those who don ’ t just buy index funds but also aren ’ t fulltime traders ."

      "selftext": "I’m still bearish on Adobe after this earnings report. Yes, revenue grew about ten percent year over year and ARR ended the year roughly eleven percent higher, but the way they achieved that growth raises real concerns. For the first time in recent memory Adobe did not disclose net new user or net new ARR additions in the release. They normally highlight that metric when it is strong. Leaving it out right when they are pushing higher pricing across Creative Cloud and charging for generative AI credits looks intentional. If user growth were healthy they would have said so. What they did report makes the picture clearer. Digital Media revenue rose, but almost all of the lift came from higher average revenue per customer. The company recently increased subscription prices and shifted customers onto more expensive AI enabled plans. That explains why revenue and ARR are up even though they chose not to show how many new users they added. It strongly suggests that the growth came from charging the existing base more, not from expanding the base itself. That strategy can work for a few quarters but it is not sustainable in a market where capable AI based creative tools are becoming dramatically cheaper. Many customers could get similar results at a fraction of Adobe’s pricing if they switched. If user growth is slowing while ARPU rises, eventually the math breaks. When that becomes clearer in future reports the stock will have a harder time justifying its current valuation. That is why I remain bearish here despite the headline beats.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m still bearish on Adobe after this earnings report . Yes revenue grew about ten percent year over year and ARR ended the year roughly eleven percent higher but the way they achieved that growth raises real concerns . For the first time in recent memory Adobe did not_disclose net new user or net new ARR additions in the release . They normally highlight that metric when it is strong . Leaving it out right when they are pushing higher pricing across Creative Cloud and charging for generative AI credits looks intentional . If user growth were healthy they would have said so . What they did report makes the picture clearer . Digital Media revenue rose but almost all of the lift came from higher average revenue per customer . The company recently increased subscription prices and shifted customers onto more expensive AI enabled plans . That explains why revenue and ARR are up even though they chose not_to show how many new users they added . It strongly suggests that the growth came from charging the existing base more not_from expanding the base itself . That strategy can work for a few quarters but it is not_sustainable in a market where capable AI based creative tools are becoming dramatically cheaper . Many customers could get similar results at a fraction of Adobe ’ s pricing if they switched . If user growth is slowing while ARPU rises eventually the math breaks . When that becomes clearer in future reports the stock will have a harder time justifying its current valuation . That is why I remain bearish here despite the headline beats ."

      "selftext": "I built a dividend portfolio over 3 years, and currently sitting at about 95k mostly dividend aristocrats, reits, some utilities but overall yield is around 3.2%, which gives me roughly 250 bucks monthly… It's stable and growing but the income feels really slow for the capital committed. I started researching option income strategies and the basic concept is just selling time decay instead of waiting for quarterly dividend payments so I spent 5 weeks paper trading before moving 20k from dividends to systematic credit spreads Results so far are pretty different, that 20k was generating about 50 bucks monthly in dividends but now it's generating 350 to 550 monthly selling weekly options, depending on the market conditions and how many trades hit targets, a massive income increase but obviously way more work and risk. What's interesting though is monthly consistency as dividends come quarterly but option premium comes weekly, sometimes daily so it feels more like actual income stream instead of waiting 3 months between payments, the psychological difference is bigger than I expected as well For people who shifted from dividend income to premium income, what percentage feels right? I am thinking maybe 30% in options max, keeping 70% in stable dividends but I'm curious what allocation others landed on after testing both approaches.",

      "selftext": "I am going through specifics of the scam because I know there are people that won't believe they're being scammed unless their scenario matches exactly and entirely. Here's the process 1. They advertise their scam group on a platform like instagram, pretending to be another app. When you click on it, it asks you to message a whatsapp number. 2. There are 2 \"important\" people. One is the mentor and one is the advisor. The advisor always direct messages you, and the mentor speaks AI summaries of stock events in the group chat. 3. The group chat is filled with AI bots messaging around. it's to add legitimacy. 4. They will suggest you stocks. After you buy them, the advisor will ask you to provide screenshots. Q: Why do they ask you for screenshots? A: It's to make you accustomed to the process. They don't need screenshots of the transactions for their normal stock suggestions. It's useless for them. Edit: following a comment - it's not exactly useless, it also lets them know how much you have and are willing to invest to see if you're worth their time. The only time they need it is when they finally advertise their pump and dump scam stock. They require the screenshots of the transactions so they can figure out how much money they scammed out of you to get a cut. 5. After 2 months regular stock recommendations. They will advertise and hype up their scam stock, promising 150% gains. They want you to put as much as possible. Just to add on, they don't specify the stock ticker until the last day (Dec 8). They advertise the releasement of the stock ticker, not the stock itself. 6. [chow stock - Google Search]( This was the specific scam stock recommended yesterday. It went up by 20% before dropping 85% today (Dec 10th). It's honestly impressive. 7. I've been too lazy to photoshop/html edit the transactions, so they're trying everything in their power to get me to send the evidence. Including calling me 15 times yesterday and promising a 80% cash back on the imaginary losses. (I told them i invested 100k)",

      "selftext_processed": "I am going through specifics of the scam because I know there are people that wont believe theyre being scammed unless their scenario matches exactly and entirely . Heres the process 1 . They advertise their scam group on a platform like instagram pretending to be another app . When you click on it it asks you to message a whatsapp number . 2 . There are 2 important people . One is the mentor and one is the advisor . The advisor always direct messages you and the mentor speaks AI summaries of stock events in the group chat . 3 . The group chat is filled with AI bots messaging around . its to add legitimacy . 4 . They will suggest you stocks . After you buy them the advisor will ask you to provide screenshots . Q Why do they ask you for screenshots A Its to make you accustomed to the process . They dont need screenshots of the transactions for their normal stock suggestions . Its useless for them . Edit following a comment its not_exactly useless it also lets them know how much you have and are willing to invest to see if youre worth their time . The only time they need it is when they finally advertise their pump and dump scam stock . They require the screenshots of the transactions so they can figure out how much money they scammed out of you to get a cut . 5 . After 2 months regular stock recommendations . They will advertise and hype up their scam stock promising 150 % gains . They want you to put as much as possible . Just to add on they dont specify the stock ticker until the last day Dec 8 . They advertise the releasement of the stock ticker not_the stock itself . 6. chow stock Google Search This was the specific scam stock recommended yesterday . It went up by 20 % before dropping 85 % today Dec 10th . Its honestly impressive . 7 . Ive been too lazy to photoshophtml edit the transactions so theyre trying everything in their power to get me to send the evidence . Including calling me 15 times yesterday and promising a 80 % cash back on the imaginary losses . I told them i invested 100k"

      "title": "Mittal Steel: Decade high breakout + insane fundamentals + play on Ukraine War Ending",
      "selftext": "Hey All, TLDR: MT $70 target book value / fundamental value. Catalysts are huge technical breakout, perfect alignment of fundamentals, and possible gasoline on the fire if the Ukraine war ends, or possible announcements on rare earths like everybody else. They have a lot of mines. I have built a bit of a specialization in steel stocks. Caught the huge run in NUE in 21', the X buyout in '23, and again when it went through among some other trades. I thought I'd share my latest trade idea. Mittal Steel is the largest global steel company outside of China with operations globally. Weekly Chart: Massive breakout and trading at a 12 year high. Global profile in 2nd screen shot. General notes below. 1. MT 1. Target: $70 18X Long Run Earnings conservative, $70.75 Book Value 2. Q EPS Growth: 31.36% 255.75% (14.18%) 86.85% 3. Q REV Growth: 3.03% (1.99%) (9.11%) 1.11% 4. Next Q EPS: 31%, 9%, -5%, 61% 5. Next Q REV: 7%, 3% next two years 6. Catalysts: 7. Technicals 1. Technicals very strong. Trading at a decade high. Huge breakout 2. IWM huge long term breakout 3. Fed QE 4. Long hated stock 8. Fundamentals 1. Probably 2nd best run steel company globally after Steel Dynamics 2. Bought back almost 40% of shares in the last 5 years. Huge ongoing buybacks. 3. USA, EU, Canada Protections and more seem to be coming to keep China steel out. Everywhere MT operates is looking to protect their industry. 4. And over the last four years combined, capital spending amounted to $15.49 billion resulting in $1.9 billion in through cycle EBITDA coming (step change in profitability), Very Cheap, 5. M&A target (BHP, RIO, NUE?), 50% of FCF going to buying back shares. Nearly 40% in the last few years. Nice dividend. 6. China steel exports may or may not be sustainable. Iron ore prices rising. Massive China Stimulus + recovering market. 7. Number 1 global volume outside of China which everybody is putting tariffs on. 8. Trading 1/2 of Revenue, 63% of Book Value 9. Europe waking up. Massive German/Europe Stimulus. Global stimulus. Back to strength globally from trough? Europe Anti dumping cases. 22% USA Profits. 10. Drove at least $3-4 in value taking over Calvert a huge plant when the Nippon deal to acquire U.S. Steel went through. . Strongest price action of all steel companies. New market leader. 9. Catalysts 1. Massive Technical Breakout + Fundamental factors above. 2. If the Ukraine War Ends we will pop massively due to huge steel demand to rebuild. MT has extensive Ukraine and EU assets. 3. Any mention of rare earths it could rocket even if it is a gimmick. Positions",

      "selftext": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Self-driving Waymo taxis have gone viral for negative reasons involving the death of a beloved San Francisco bodega cat and pulling an illegal U-turn in front of police who were unable to issue a ticket to a nonexistent driver. But this week, the self-driving taxis are the bearer of happier news after a San Francisco woman gave birth in a Waymo. The mother was on her way to the University of California, San Francisco medical center Monday when she delivered inside the robotaxi, said a Waymo spokesperson in a statement Wednesday. The company said its rider support team detected “unusual activity” inside the vehicle and called to check on the rider as well as alert 911. Waymo, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, declined to elaborate on how the vehicle knew something was amiss. The taxi and its passengers arrived safely at the hospital ahead of emergency services. Jess Berthold, a UCSF spokesperson, confirmed the mother and child were brought to the hospital. She said the mother was not available for interviews. Waymo said the vehicle was taken out of service for cleaning after the ride. While still rare, this was not the first baby delivered in one of its taxis, the company said.",

I might be a little off, and the data might be outdated and inconclusive. Is sharing it with the community safe? I'm taking a risk, but this is what I've read and learned. Please correct me if I'm mistaken. 1. The Federal Reserve Rate Cut: (-.25%) Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting today, December 10, 2025, by cutting its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5%-3.75%. The Fed also initiated the purchase of shorter-term Treasury securities. Key Decisions and Implications: ⦁ Interest Rate Cut: This is the third consecutive quarter-point rate cut this year. This move aims to support the labor market amidst a slowing economy, though it has faced some dissent among FOMC members due to lingering inflation concerns. ⦁ Bond Purchases (Balance Sheet Policy): The Committee announced it will initiate purchases of shorter-term Treasury securities as needed to maintain an ample supply of bank reserves. This follows an earlier decision in October to cease quantitative tightening (QT), meaning the Fed will now roll over all maturing securities instead of letting them run off its balance sheet. This shift is a technical adjustment to manage reserve levels within the banking system, which were showing signs of stress in the repo (repurchase agreement) market. Perspective: BULLISH 🙂 ⦁ Down -25% (75 basis points total and a total of three cuts in 2025) ⦁ Short term treasuries, quantitative tightening ⦁ Jerome Powell is terminated (FOMC Chairman) 2. Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia swinging (November) $195 -> $170 -> $183 today ⦁ AI companies (TOP 7) are being challenged by smaller competitors ⦁ Remember Deep Seek fears from a China competitor ⦁ Nvidia challenged by Google Gemini buyers from Meta data centers ⦁ No quantum computing technology to break encryption coding Random Bulls Events: ⦁ Worldwide cartel wallets were liquidated during the drop of 30% recently in crypto ⦁ Financial Institutions are offering ETFs stocks through pro crypto recently. New players are IE. (JPMorgan, Vanguard, Schwab, Morgan Stanley.) ⦁ Michael Saylor offering a 12 year cycle explanation now that the mining has capped 95% Random Bears Events: ⦁ Government - Shutdown 43 days - influenced the market heavily in all aspects ⦁ Jobs - No November or December job reports or accuracy ⦁ Unemployment - Raised over the past two years ⦁ Tariffs - Taxing everyone Random Thoughts: Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency validated and still in service. There are 21,000,000 coins and 95% have been mined. An unknown number of coins have been lost forever. Imagine there are 8,200,000,000 (8.2 billion) humans on earth today. 1 of 4 are Chinese. (25% people on EARTH) 2,000,000,000 (2.0 billion) Chinese. Put this into perspective China are not pro crypto, nor is it legal since its ban in 2021. Meaning, in China you can be literally hanged, if not imprisoned for 10 years when trading crypto. Yet, you can mine in China, as they are #3 in the world in this field. The crypto market is down 2 billion users possibly, not 2 billion dollars. This number is trillions. Possibly more than gold. It's almost like they are the little kid who can't play with the big kids when playing sports. They are hindered by the government's choices for freedom of investments.",

I might be a little off and the data might be outdated and inconclusive . Is sharing it with the community safe Im taking a risk but this is what Ive read and learned . Please correct me if Im mistaken . 1 . The Federal Reserve Rate Cut .25 % Federal Open Market Committee FOMC meeting today December 10 2025 by cutting its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5 % 3.75 % . The Fed also initiated the purchase of shorterterm Treasury securities . Key Decisions and Implications ⦁ Interest Rate Cut This is the third consecutive quarterpoint rate cut this year . This move aims to support the labor market amidst a slowing economy though it has faced some dissent among FOMC members due to lingering inflation concerns . ⦁ Bond Purchases Balance Sheet Policy The Committee announced it will initiate purchases of shorterterm Treasury securities as needed to maintain an ample supply of bank reserves . This follows an earlier decision in October to cease quantitative tightening QT meaning the Fed will now roll over all maturing securities instead of letting them run off its balance sheet . This shift is a technical adjustment to manage reserve levels within the banking system which were showing signs of stress in the repo repurchase agreement market . Perspective BULLISH 🙂 ⦁ Down 25 % 75 basis points total and a total of three cuts in 2025 ⦁ Short term treasuries quantitative tightening ⦁ Jerome Powell is terminated FOMC Chairman 2 . Artificial Intelligence Nvidia swinging November $ 195 $ 170 $ 183 today ⦁ AI companies TOP 7 are being challenged by smaller competitors ⦁ Remember Deep Seek fears from a China competitor ⦁ Nvidia challenged by Google Gemini buyers from Meta data centers ⦁ No_quantum computing technology to break encryption coding Random Bulls Events ⦁ Worldwide cartel wallets were liquidated during the drop of 30 % recently in crypto ⦁ Financial Institutions are offering ETFs stocks through pro crypto recently . New players are IE . JPMorgan Vanguard Schwab Morgan Stanley . ⦁ Michael Saylor offering a 12 year cycle explanation now that the mining has capped 95 % Random Bears Events ⦁ Government Shutdown 43 days influenced the market heavily in all aspects ⦁ Jobs No_November or December job reports or accuracy ⦁ Unemployment Raised over the past two years ⦁ Tariffs Taxing everyone Random Thoughts Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency validated and still in service . There are 21000000 coins and 95 % have been mined . An unknown number of coins have been lost forever . Imagine there are 8200000000 8.2 billion humans on earth today . 1 of 4 are Chinese . 25 % people on EARTH 2000000000 2.0 billion Chinese . Put this into perspective China are not_pro crypto nor is it legal since its ban in 2021 . Meaning in China you can be literally hanged if not_imprisoned for 10 years when trading crypto . Yet you can mine in China as they are 3 in the world in this field . The crypto market is down 2 billion users possibly not_2 billion dollars . This number is trillions . Possibly more than gold . Its almost like they are the little kid who cant play with the big kids when playing sports . They are hindered by the governments choices for freedom of investments ."

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus: Earnings per share: $2.26 adjusted vs. $1.64 expected Revenue: $16.06 billion vs. $16.21 billion expected Oracle’s revenue grew 14% year over year in the quarter that ended Nov. 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $6.14 billion, or $2.14 per share, rose from $3,151 billion, or $1.13 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings exclude stock-based compensation. The company posted $7.98 billion in cloud revenue, more than the $7.92 consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount. Cloud infrastructure revenue totaled $4.1 billion. Remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that hasn’t yet been recognized, soared 438% to $523 billion, topping the $501.8 billion average analyst estimate, according to StreetAccount. Doug Kehring, Oracle’s principal financial officer, said in the release that RPO were driven “by new commitments from Meta, Nvidia and others.” The stock plummeted 23% in November, its worst monthly performance since 2001 and, as of Wednesday’s close, is 32% below its record reached in September. Still, the shares are up 34% for the year, outperforming the Nasdaq, which has gained 22% over that stretch. Oracle generated $5.88 billion in software revenue, down 3% and lower than StreetAccount’s $6.06 billion consensus. Source:",

      "selftext": "Major Drilling is a high leverage play on the potential new exploration supercycle, as the West seeks independence from China in critical minerals and rare earth elements. Demand for metals like copper, nickel, lithium, silver, and rare earths is rising due to military technology, AI infrastructure, robotics, and electrification. Strong gold and silver prices further support exploration budgets. This is expected to drive junior and senior mining companies to drill extensively. Major Drilling benefits as a global market leader with 45 years of experience in precision core drilling, and its archaeology services provide an edge in permitting and community relations. During the 2010 cycle, the stock traded at 21 CAD. Adjusting for the US M2 money supply expansion of about 2.79 times since 2007 gives a conservative price target of roughly 33 to 36 CAD. The theoretical peak adjusted for money supply would be above 58 CAD. Current price is around 13.60 CAD, with a market cap of approximately 1.1 billion CAD. The next earnings report on December 10 could act as a catalyst. Risks include exploration cycle volatility, execution challenges with fleet and labor expansion, and macroeconomic slowdowns that could delay project starts. Nfa. Dyor.",

      "selftext": "Some possible consequences: * End of the \"Restrictive\" Phase: By labeling the current range as neutral, the Fed signals that its post-hike monetary policy is no longer actively restrictive or braking the economy. * Discussion goes from \"how much more easing is needed?\" to \"how long will we stay here?\" * Increased Market Uncertainty: Powell's estimate is notably higher than the 3.0% for the neutral rate among FOMC members. This discrepancy suggests increased variance of positions across the board. If the actual neutral rate is lower than 3.50%–3.75%, the Fed may be passively tightening, leading to a slower growth outlook. If the market believes the Fed is now neutral, it may expect rate cuts only if the economy shows clear signs distress, or drop in inflation. * The bar for future rate cuts is now higher. The Fed may be willing to hold rates at this level for an extended period, which could push up longer-term yields. In sum: stocks may still rise, but the rates of rising will be more muted, and the probabilities of flat to down moves higher",

      "selftext_processed": "Some possible consequences End of the Restrictive Phase By labeling the current range as neutral the Fed signals that its posthike monetary policy is no_longer actively restrictive or braking the economy . Discussion goes from how much more easing is needed to how long will we stay here Increased Market Uncertainty Powells estimate is notably higher than the 3.0 % for the neutral rate among FOMC members . This discrepancy suggests increased variance of positions across the board . If the actual neutral rate is lower than 3.50 % –3.75 % the Fed may be passively tightening leading to a slower growth outlook . If the market believes the Fed is now neutral it may expect rate cuts only if the economy shows clear signs distress or drop in inflation . The bar for future rate cuts is now higher . The Fed may be willing to hold rates at this level for an extended period which could push up longerterm yields . In sum stocks may still rise but the rates of rising will be more muted and the probabilities of flat to down moves higher"

      "selftext": "The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again on Wednesday, but the decision came with unusually visible internal disagreement. The FOMC lowered the benchmark rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a 3.5%–3.75% range. While the move was widely expected, the tone around the announcement was far more cautious than markets were hoping for. The vote itself highlighted how divided policymakers have become. Three members dissented the most since 2019. Governor Stephen Miran pushed for a larger half-point cut, while Kansas City’s Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago’s Austan Goolsbee argued for no cut at all. That split essentially captures the Fed’s current dilemma: one camp is growing more concerned about weakening labor data, while the other worries that easing too fast could reignite inflation. This is Miran’s third straight dissent ahead of his January departure, and Schmid’s second. The mixed messaging reinforces the idea that although cuts are happening, the path forward may be slower and bumpier than markets expected. The Fed is easing, but not without hesitation and not without signaling that future moves are far from guaranteed. Source:",

Shares have been swinging around as investors debate whether the company’s heavy push into AI infrastructure will actually pay off at the pace management expects. That debate got louder after Oracle raised $18 billion in debt back in September, which added financial leverage right as spending ramps up. On top of that, the company also announced leadership changes during the quarter, naming Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as successors to CEO Safra Catz. So this earnings call isn’t just about quarterly numbers it’s also about whether the AI strategy looks financially sustainable and how the market feels about the next generation of leadership taking charge.

      "selftext": "The Broken Yardstick: Why Your “Historic” P/E Chart is Lying to You There is a lot of talk about an ‘AI bubble’ and elevated SP500 multiples these days. If you have spent any time in financial social media circles you have certainly seen a chart comparing a graph of the S&P 500’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio. The current multiple looks elevated, compared against a long-term average of ~15/16x. The conclusion is always the same: “The market is expensive. A mean reversion is inevitable. We are in an AI bubble.” Let me start by making clear, this post is intended to provide some perspective and insight into the context of the current multiples, not to say the market PE isn’t elevated. I am not saying that ‘this time is different’… BUT some things are different. Notably, the accounting rules we use to define the ‘E’ in P/E.” Comparing the S&P500 PE ratio of today to that of the past is apples-to-oranges comparison. This common comparison assumes that the “E” (Earnings) in the 1990s and early 2000s measures the same thing as the “E” in 2025. It doesn’t. Over the last two decades, there have been several major accounting changes that have changed the way companies report profits. Almost every single change has made today’s accounting more conservative, suppressing reported earnings compared to the past. Those changes were made for a reason, much of today’s accounting is more transparent, it is more rational, but it makes comparison cloudy. Let’s look at what’s changed and what the impact has been… The SBC Distortion: The Core 10-15% Earnings Drag: The major difference of now vs then is the way GAAP requires companies to account for stock-based compensation (SBC). Did you know that stock-based compensation was only required to be recorded as an expense as of 2006? Before 2006, companies could issue massive stock options, dilute shareholders, and report zero expense on the income statement. SBC prior to 2006 has zero impact on Earnings Per Share (EPS). That ended with FAS 123(R), which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other share-based payments on their income statements instead of just disclosing it in footnotes. Today, rightfully so, SBC is a required, non-cash, impact on earnings. It belongs in the income statement as an expense. Buffett and Munger agree, commenting on it in the 1998 Shareholder Letter, prior to the accounting rule changes described above. \"A few years ago we asked three questions in these pages to which we have not yet received an answer: “If options aren’t a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn’t go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go?”\" (Cool Note: Berkshire terminated their stock options program at this time, opting to pay cash incentives so that their financials reporting reflected the true expense to their shareholders, voluntarily.) On the change: \"Though the two (incentive) plans are an economic wash, the cash plan we are putting in will produce a vastly different accounting result. This Alice-in-Wonderland outcome occurs because existing accounting principles ignore the cost of stock options when earnings are being calculated, even though options are a huge and increasing expense at a great many corporations. In effect, accounting principles offer management a choice: Pay employees in one form and count the cost, or pay them in another form and ignore the cost. Small wonder then that the use of options has mushroomed.\" (Berkshire voluntarily chose to count the cost.) The Impact: SBC now accounts for roughly 10-15% of total S&P 500 earnings. If we reverted to 1999 rules, we would add that expense right back into the bottom line, drastically increasing bottom line earnings. Here’s a real world example. Let’s look at Microsoft ($MSFT) using current numbers (Q3 2025 Numbers). Looking at the financials, we can see the SBC impact on its valuation. Current Numbers: Price (12/6/25): $483.15 Market Cap: ~$3.59 trillion TTM Net Income: $104.91 billion Diluted EPS: $14.1 GAAP PE: ~34.26x Pre-2006 Accounting Adjustment: TTM Stock Based Compensation: $12.12 billion Adjusted Net Income (excluding SBC): $104.91b + $12.12b = $117.03b (-12.12% expense) Adjusted PE Ratio: ~30.6x or a roughly 11% discount Now let’s look at Microsoft ($MSFT) during the 2000 peak. Reported Numbers 2000: Market Cap (Peak): ~$600 billion Reported Operating Income: $11b Reported Net Income: ~9.4 billion Diluted EPS: $1.70 Headline PE: ~62.82x Adjusted Numbers (applying current day accounting rules): Market Cap (Peak): ~$600 billion Pro Forma Footnote Operating Income to adjust for SBC: $9.11b (-17.2% impact) Pro Forma Footnote Net Income to adjust for SBC: ~8.1b (-13% impact) Diluted EPS: $1.57 (-12.9% impact) Adjusted PE: ~74.07x MSFT 2001 and 2002: The gap widens… 2001: Reported Operating Income: $11.72b vs. Pro Forma: $8.34b (-28.8% impact) Reported Net Income: $7.35b vs Pro Forma: $5.08b (-30.9% impact) Reported Diluted EPS: $1.32 vs Pro Forma: $0.91 (-31.1% impact) Quarter Ending June 30, 2001 High Price: $73.68 Headline ‘reported’ PE: 55.81x vs Adjusted PE (current day SBC accounting): 80.96x 2002: Reported Operating Income: $11.91b vs. Pro Forma: $8.27b (-30.6% impact) Reported Net Income: $7.83b vs Pro Forma: $5.36b (-31.5% impact) Reported Diluted EPS: $1.41 vs Pro Forma: $0.98 (-30.5% impact) Quarter Ending June 30, 2001 High Price: $60.38 Headline ‘reported’ PE: 42.82x vs Adjusted PE (current day SBC accounting): 63.65x When you take required reporting changes into account, the picture changes. But SBC isn’t the only accounting change holding back earnings... Regarding Intangibles: Beyond SBC, the American economy has changed and the companies that make up the S&P500 have shifted from companies with tangible assets (factories, plants, equipment) to intangible assets (IP, software) and current day accounting rules penalize this shift in regards to valuation. For reference: Back in 1975, intangible assets made up just 17% of assets on the balance sheets of S&P 500 companies. Less than 50 years later, intangible assets exceed 90% of total assets on balance sheets. This is due to the domination of software in the economy and tech companies becoming the heaviest weighted sector in the S&P 500 by market capitalization. While Goodwill amortization went away, in 2002 a new accounting rule replaced it with a new, massive expense: Amortization of Definite-Lived Intangibles. When Tech Company A buys Tech Company B, a large percentage of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets (Patents, Developed Technology, Customer Lists, etc.) Unlike Goodwill, these MUST be amortized. Because M&A volume is so much higher today (and tech valuations are higher), this amortization expense has exploded. For the S&P 500, this is now often the single largest adjustment between GAAP (reported) earnings and Non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings, amounting to over $140 Billion per year in expenses. In other words, that is a -6% drag on the S&P 500s net income, further compressing earnings and expanding multiples when compared to previous periods. Regarding R&D and the ‘Missing Amortization’: The US economic and S&P500 transition from a manufacturing capex heavy composition to a tech/innovation driven composition also creates challenges for comparison of as reported earnings multiples. The companies and the economy have changed but the expensing of investment in research and development is treated very differently than investment in manufacturing buildouts. This may be the biggest distortion to current day earnings vs historic. Keep in mind, we are obviously in a major capex cycle so many of the typically “capex light” tech companies are becoming more “capex heavy,” yet, the point still stands. Old Economy: If you build a factory, you capitalize the cost and depreciate it over 30 years. The hit to earnings is spread out via straight line depreciation. New Economy (Software/Tech): If you spend billions on R&D to build software, you must expense it immediately. Because Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google spend massive amounts on R&D ($211B+ combined annually as of FY2024), their reported earnings are impacted immediately, where an industrial company re-investing in its business smooths out the cost over multiple decades, drastically reducing the annual impact on earnings. According to a 2022 Morgan Stanley report by Michael Mauboussin: \"The global economy continues to shift from one built on tangible assets to one built on intangible assets. Accounting, the means by which financial information is presented, treats tangible and intangible investments differently. This introduces bias into common metrics such as earnings. Most intangible investments appear on the income statement. Capitalizing those investments treats them in a fashion similar to capital expenditures. The result is that earnings and investments increase the same amount. This leaves free cash flow unchanged but provides a more accurate picture of a company’s operations. Given the assumptions we use, the capitalization of intangible investments would lead to net income for the S&P 500 that is about 12 percent higher than what is reported. These figures suggest great caution in comparing earnings or multiples over time.\" Taking this into account, earnings would be higher than 12% currently and the PE Ratio would be lower. So, while reported earnings are benefiting from the lack of old school Goodwill amortization, they are being impacted far more by the immediate expensing of R&D and the amortization of acquired tech. The net result is that current PE ratios are overstated relative to history because the earnings are being conservatively suppressed new modern day accounting rules. But What Even Is the S&P 500? Finally, let’s address the common complaint about the index itself: “The S&P 500 is too top-heavy. The market is so concentrated.” Somewhere along the way, the S&P 500 transitioned from being a passive tracking index of the US economy to an active financial product itself, serving as the favorite proxy for the overall stock market. But the S&P500 is a market-cap weighted index by design. It is not meant to be a representation of the average business; it is a momentum strategy. The index is built to reward our economy’s best companies by letting winners run and dropping the worst performers. When people complain that “the Mag7 is driving the index” they are essentially complaining that the winners are winning and that the strategy is working as intended. I see so many arguments that the “Mag 7” (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Nvidia, etc.) are distorting the market. But looking at them as just “7 stocks” is a mistake. They are diversified conglomerates. The Mag7 is more akin to the Mag70. • ⁠Amazon is a retailer, a logistics company, an advertising agency, and a Cloud hyperscaler, that is building satellites and working on robots… • ⁠Microsoft is enterprise SaaS, Cloud hyperscaler, Gaming studio. • ⁠Google is a Cloud hyperscaler, leading AI developer, the largest search business, advertiser, streaming service, AV operator, soon to be TPU business. These companies are the most diversified businesses in the world and rightfully command a higher multiple not because of hype, but because they delivering seemingly unimaginable products, services, and financial results to match. Their net profit margins hover around ~26%, roughly double the S&P 500 average of ~13%. They are twice as efficient at turning revenue into profit and their earnings growth is keeping pace with their multiple expansion. The S&P500 Index is not your only access to the stock market. You are not a forced buyer. Viewing the S&P 500 as the only “investable universe” is misleading. We live in the golden age of ETFs and individual access to stock market research. No one is forcing you to buy the market-cap weighted index. Not happy with the composition? Stop viewing it as a product and view it as a tracking index as it initially was intended. Worried about concentration? Buy the Equal Weight S&P 500. If you choose to buy the S&P500 index, you are making an active choice to bet on the winners. Stop being upset when they win. Conclusion: The Normalizing Adjustment I started this post by saying I wasn’t arguing “this time is different,” but rather that the accounting is different. To create a consistent comparison of S&P500 valuations, we have to level the playing field. Remember, this is an exercise in expanding your perspective. I strongly prefer today’s accounting standards to those of the 1990s and use GAAP reported numbers as my baseline for company valuation. In no way am I suggesting you to do otherwise or that things should be changed. What I am suggesting is that you view the comparison of current day financial reporting with that of the past with a holistic perspective and acknowledge that things are different. Lets strip away the layers of modern current day accounting changes to see what the market really looks like compared to the rules of the 1990s. Here is the step-by-step impact on the S&P 500 P/E ratio (currently ~29x) if we revert to historical rules: The “SBC” Adjustment • ⁠The Change: We add back the mandatory 10-15% Stock-Based Compensation expense that was hidden in the 90s. • ⁠The Impact: Earnings rise ~12.5% (midpoint). • ⁠The Result: The P/E drops from 29x to ~25.8x. The “R&D Innovation” Adjustment • ⁠The Change: We keep the SBC add-back AND we capitalize R&D expenses (treating them as assets/investments like factories, rather than immediate costs). • ⁠The Impact: As noted by Morgan Stanley, this boosts earnings by another ~12%. • ⁠The Result: The P/E drops from 25.8x to ~23.0x. A “Full Scope” Adjustment • ⁠The Change: We include the above, PLUS we adjust for the aggressive amortization of acquired intangibles through M&A. • ⁠The Impact: We add back a conservative ~3% drag (discounting from the full 6% to account for historical M&A activity). • ⁠The Result: The P/E drops from 23.0x to ~22.3x. The Reverse Adjustment: Today’s accounting applied to the past Finally, let’s look at it the other way. What happens if we take the historical markets of the dot-com era and apply today’s accounting rules? • ⁠If we applied today’s SBC expensing rules to the 2000 peak, earnings would have been ~10-20% lower. • ⁠The peak P/E of the Dot-Com bubble wasn’t 30x... by today’s standards it was ~34x - 38x. When you compare a 22.3 - 25.8x market (Adjusted to 1990s Rules) to a 30.5x market (The 2000 Peak under 1990s Rules), some of the bubble talk can subside. Especially when you acknowledge that the average PE of the last 50 years is 19.5x vs the often cited all-time average of 16x. The market is trading at a premium, but, in my opinion, is not in a bubble. We are in the midst of a technological revolution and company earnings are driving their multiples. Thanks for reading.

      "selftext_processed": "The Broken Yardstick Why Your “ Historic ” PE Chart is Lying to You There is a lot of talk about an ‘ AI bubble ’ and elevated SP500 multiples these days . If you have spent any time in financial social media circles you have certainly seen a chart comparing a graph of the SP 500 ’ s PricetoEarnings PE ratio . The current multiple looks elevated compared against a longterm average of 1516x . The conclusion is always the same “ The market is expensive . A mean reversion is inevitable . We are in an AI bubble. ” Let me start by making clear this post is intended to provide some perspective and insight into the context of the current multiples not_to say the market PE isn ’ t elevated . I am not_saying that ‘ this time is different ’ … BUT some things are different . Notably the accounting rules we use to define the ‘ E ’ in PE. ” Comparing the SP500 PE ratio of today to that of the past is applestooranges comparison . This common comparison assumes that the “ E ” Earnings in the 1990s and early 2000s measures the same thing as the “ E ” in 2025 . It doesn ’ t . Over the last two decades there have been several major accounting changes that have changed the way companies report profits . Almost every single change has made today ’ s accounting more conservative suppressing reported earnings compared to the past . Those changes were made for a reason much of today ’ s accounting is more transparent it is more rational but it makes comparison cloudy . Let ’ s look at what ’ s changed and what the impact has been… The SBC Distortion The Core 1015 % Earnings Drag The major difference of now vs then is the way GAAP requires companies to account for stockbased compensation SBC . Did you know that stockbased compensation was only required to be recorded as an expense as of 2006 Before 2006 companies could issue massive stock options dilute shareholders and report zero expense on the income statement . SBC prior to 2006 has zero impact on Earnings Per Share EPS . That ended with FAS 123R which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other sharebased payments on their income statements instead of just disclosing it in footnotes . Today rightfully so SBC is a required noncash impact on earnings . It belongs in the income statement as an expense . Buffett and Munger agree commenting on it in the 1998 Shareholder Letter prior to the accounting rule changes described above . A few years ago we asked three questions in these pages to which we have not_yet received an answer “ If options aren ’ t a form of compensation what are they If compensation isn ’ t an expense what is it And if expenses shouldn ’ t go into the calculation of earnings where in the world should they go ” Cool Note Berkshire terminated their stock options program at this time opting to pay cash incentives so that their financials reporting reflected the true expense to their shareholders voluntarily . On the change Though the two incentive plans are an economic wash the cash plan we are putting in will produce a vastly different accounting result . This AliceinWonderland outcome occurs because existing accounting principles ignore the cost of stock options when earnings are being calculated even though options are a huge and increasing expense at a great many corporations . In effect accounting principles offer management a choice Pay employees in one form and count the cost or pay them in another form and ignore the cost . Small wonder then that the use of options has mushroomed . Berkshire voluntarily chose to count the cost . The Impact SBC now accounts for roughly 1015 % of total SP 500 earnings . If we reverted to 1999 rules we would add that expense right back into the bottom line drastically increasing bottom line earnings . Here ’ s a real world example . Let ’ s look at Microsoft $ MSFT using current numbers Q3 2025 Numbers . Looking at the financials we can see the SBC impact on its valuation . Current Numbers Price 12625 $ 483.15 Market Cap $ 3.59 trillion TTM Net Income $ 104.91 billion Diluted EPS $ 14.1 GAAP PE 34.26x Pre2006 Accounting Adjustment TTM Stock Based Compensation $ 12.12 billion Adjusted Net Income excluding SBC $ 104.91b $ 12.12b $ 117.03b 12.12 % expense Adjusted PE Ratio 30.6x or a roughly 11 % discount Now let ’ s look at Microsoft $ MSFT during the 2000 peak . Reported Numbers 2000 Market Cap Peak $ 600 billion Reported Operating Income $ 11b Reported Net Income 9.4 billion Diluted EPS $ 1.70 Headline PE 62.82x Adjusted Numbers applying current day accounting rules Market Cap Peak $ 600 billion Pro Forma Footnote Operating Income to adjust for SBC $ 9.11b 17.2 % impact Pro Forma Footnote Net Income to adjust for SBC 8.1b 13 % impact Diluted EPS $ 1.57 12.9 % impact Adjusted PE 74.07x MSFT 2001 and 2002 The gap widens… 2001 Reported Operating Income $ 11.72b vs . Pro Forma $ 8.34b 28.8 % impact Reported Net Income $ 7.35b vs Pro Forma $ 5.08b 30.9 % impact Reported Diluted EPS $ 1.32 vs Pro Forma $ 0.91 31.1 % impact Quarter Ending June 30 2001 High Price $ 73.68 Headline ‘ reported ’ PE 55.81x vs Adjusted PE current day SBC accounting 80.96x 2002 Reported Operating Income $ 11.91b vs . Pro Forma $ 8.27b 30.6 % impact Reported Net Income $ 7.83b vs Pro Forma $ 5.36b 31.5 % impact Reported Diluted EPS $ 1.41 vs Pro Forma $ 0.98 30.5 % impact Quarter Ending June 30 2001 High Price $ 60.38 Headline ‘ reported ’ PE 42.82x vs Adjusted PE current day SBC accounting 63.65x When you take required reporting changes into account the picture changes . But SBC isn ’ t the only accounting change holding back earnings ... Regarding Intangibles Beyond SBC the American economy has changed and the companies that make up the SP500 have shifted from companies with tangible assets factories plants equipment to intangible assets IP software and current day accounting rules penalize this shift in regards to valuation . For reference Back in 1975 intangible assets made up just 17 % of assets on the balance sheets of SP 500 companies . Less than 50 years later intangible assets exceed 90 % of total assets on balance sheets . This is due to the domination of software in the economy and tech companies becoming the heaviest weighted sector in the SP 500 by market capitalization . While Goodwill amortization went away in 2002 a new accounting rule replaced it with a new massive expense Amortization of DefiniteLived Intangibles . When Tech Company A buys Tech Company B a large percentage of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets Patents Developed Technology Customer Lists etc . Unlike Goodwill these MUST be amortized . Because MA volume is so much higher today and tech valuations are higher this amortization expense has exploded . For the SP 500 this is now often the single largest adjustment between GAAP reported earnings and NonGAAP adjusted earnings amounting to over $ 140 Billion per year in expenses . In other words that is a 6 % drag on the SP 500s net income further compressing earnings and expanding multiples when compared to previous periods . Regarding RD and the ‘ Missing Amortization ’ The US economic and SP500 transition from a manufacturing capex heavy composition to a techinnovation driven composition also creates challenges for comparison of as reported earnings multiples . The companies and the economy have changed but the expensing of investment in research and development is treated very differently than investment in manufacturing buildouts . This may be the biggest distortion to current day earnings vs historic . Keep in mind we are obviously in a major capex cycle so many of the typically “ capex light ” tech companies are becoming more “ capex heavy ” yet the point still stands . Old Economy If you build a factory you capitalize the cost and depreciate it over 30 years . The hit to earnings is spread out via straight line depreciation . New Economy SoftwareTech If you spend billions on RD to build software you must expense it immediately . Because Amazon Microsoft Meta and Google spend massive amounts on RD $ 211B combined annually as of FY2024 their reported earnings are impacted immediately where an industrial company reinvesting in its business smooths out the cost over multiple decades drastically reducing the annual impact on earnings . According to a 2022 Morgan Stanley report by Michael Mauboussin The global economy continues to shift from one built on tangible assets to one built on intangible assets . Accounting the means by which financial information is presented treats tangible and intangible investments differently . This introduces bias into common metrics such as earnings . Most intangible investments appear on the income statement . Capitalizing those investments treats them in a fashion similar to capital expenditures . The result is that earnings and investments increase the same amount . This leaves free cash flow unchanged but provides a more accurate picture of a company ’ s operations . Given the assumptions we use the capitalization of intangible investments would lead to net income for the SP 500 that is about 12 percent higher than what is reported . These figures suggest great caution in comparing earnings or multiples over time . Taking this into account earnings would be higher than 12 % currently and the PE Ratio would be lower . So while reported earnings are benefiting from the lack of old school Goodwill amortization they are being impacted far more by the immediate expensing of RD and the amortization of acquired tech . The net result is that current PE ratios are overstated relative to history because the earnings are being conservatively suppressed new modern day accounting rules . But What Even Is the SP 500 Finally let ’ s address the common complaint about the index itself “ The SP 500 is too topheavy . The market is so concentrated. ” Somewhere along the way the SP 500 transitioned from being a passive tracking index of the US economy to an active financial product itself serving as the favorite proxy for the overall stock market . But the SP500 is a marketcap weighted index by design . It is not_meant to be a representation of the average business it is a momentum strategy . The index is built to reward our economy ’ s best companies by letting winners run and dropping the worst performers . When people complain that “ the Mag7 is driving the index ” they are essentially complaining that the winners are winning and that the strategy is working as intended . I see so many arguments that the “ Mag 7 ” Microsoft Apple Google Nvidia etc . are distorting the market . But looking at them as just “ 7 stocks ” is a mistake . They are diversified conglomerates . The Mag7 is more akin to the Mag70 . • ⁠Amazon is a retailer a logistics company an advertising agency and a Cloud hyperscaler that is building satellites and working on robots… • ⁠Microsoft is enterprise SaaS Cloud hyperscaler Gaming studio . • ⁠Google is a Cloud hyperscaler leading AI developer the largest search business advertiser streaming service AV operator soon to be TPU business . These companies are the most diversified businesses in the world and rightfully command a higher multiple not_because of hype but because they delivering seemingly unimaginable products services and financial results to match . Their net profit margins hover around 26 % roughly double the SP 500 average of 13 % . They are twice as efficient at turning revenue into profit and their earnings growth is keeping pace with their multiple expansion . The SP500 Index is not_your only access to the stock market . You are not_a forced buyer . Viewing the SP 500 as the only “ investable universe ” is misleading . We live in the golden age of ETFs and individual access to stock market research . No_one is forcing you to buy the marketcap weighted index . Not_happy with the composition Stop viewing it as a product and view it as a tracking index as it initially was intended . Worried about concentration Buy the Equal Weight SP 500 . If you choose to buy the SP500 index you are making an active choice to bet on the winners . Stop being upset when they win . Conclusion The Normalizing Adjustment I started this post by saying I wasn ’ t arguing “ this time is different ” but rather that the accounting is different . To create a consistent comparison of SP500 valuations we have to level the playing field . Remember this is an exercise in expanding your perspective . I strongly prefer today ’ s accounting standards to those of the 1990s and use GAAP reported numbers as my baseline for company valuation . In no_way am I suggesting you to do otherwise or that things should be changed . What I am suggesting is that you view the comparison of current day financial reporting with that of the past with a holistic perspective and acknowledge that things are different . Lets strip away the layers of modern current day accounting changes to see what the market really looks like compared to the rules of the 1990s . Here is the stepbystep impact on the SP 500 PE ratio currently 29x if we revert to historical rules The “ SBC ” Adjustment • ⁠The Change We add back the mandatory 1015 % StockBased Compensation expense that was hidden in the 90s . • ⁠The Impact Earnings rise 12.5 % midpoint . • ⁠The Result The PE drops from 29x to 25.8x . The “ RD Innovation ” Adjustment • ⁠The Change We keep the SBC addback AND we capitalize RD expenses treating them as assetsinvestments like factories rather than immediate costs . • ⁠The Impact As noted by Morgan Stanley this boosts earnings by another 12 % . • ⁠The Result The PE drops from 25.8x to 23.0x . A “ Full Scope ” Adjustment • ⁠The Change We include the above PLUS we adjust for the aggressive amortization of acquired intangibles through MA . • ⁠The Impact We add back a conservative 3 % drag discounting from the full 6 % to account for historical MA activity . • ⁠The Result The PE drops from 23.0x to 22.3x . The Reverse Adjustment Today ’ s accounting applied to the past Finally let ’ s look at it the other way . What happens if we take the historical markets of the dotcom era and apply today ’ s accounting rules • ⁠If we applied today ’ s SBC expensing rules to the 2000 peak earnings would have been 1020 % lower . • ⁠The peak PE of the DotCom bubble wasn ’ t 30x ... by today ’ s standards it was 34x 38x . When you compare a 22.3 25.8x market Adjusted to 1990s Rules to a 30.5x market The 2000 Peak under 1990s Rules some of the bubble talk can subside . Especially when you acknowledge that the average PE of the last 50 years is 19.5x vs the often cited alltime average of 16x . The market is trading at a premium but in my opinion is not_in a bubble . We are in the midst of a technological revolution and company earnings are driving their multiples . Thanks for reading . I hope you found this article interesting and helpful . Please let me know Manu"

      "selftext": "Amazon is planning a significant long-term push in India, announcing over $35 billion in investments across AI and cloud infrastructure through 2030. The company says the initiative could help create around 1 million jobs, making India one of its most important growth markets outside the U.S. Alongside the investment news, analysts have been taking a fresh look at Amazon’s broader growth outlook. Guggenheim initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a $300 price target, pointing to the company’s expanding global footprint and improving earnings trajectory. Between AWS scaling aggressively, India becoming a major strategic focus, and e-commerce margins improving, analysts seem more confident about Amazon’s long-term setup than they were earlier in the year. Curious how others see it does Amazon look fairly valued here, or is this still an underappreciated growth story?",

      "selftext": "Lately I’ve been thinking about one big question Is there still room for the market to run next year? Wall Street is getting pretty bullish about 2026, but I keep wondering is this bull run going to continue or are we already at the peak? A bunch of investment banks are betting that U.S. stocks could push higher next year. For example, Deutsche Bank set their S&P 500 target at 8,000 by the end of 2026 saying AI driven capex, corporate earnings growth, and fresh capital inflows could fuel another big leg up. Morgan Stanley thinks even if tech stocks get choppy, the overall market could still perform well thanks to rates, fiscal policy, and a rebound in more traditional sectors. Put simply, the bulls believe，AI is no longer just a hype story it’s actually turning into the foundation of economic and corporate growth. As long as AI keeps improving efficiency and there’s still liquidity in the market, stocks could keep climbing. But I’m also seeing some big red flags Most leading tech and AI names are already expensive, and overall market valuations are pretty high too On top of that, the market right now is way too dependent on a handful of mega cap tech names If those companies disappoint or the AI hype cools off, the entire market could get hit hard. And then there’s 2026 which might come with a whole bunch of uncertainties. This current structure of high concentration high valuations weak diversification makes me uneasy. History shows that bull markets can get derailed quickly by changes in the macro environment, politics, or interest rates no matter how strong the bull feels. So here’s my approach going into 2026， I’ll put some money into tech AI high growth ，I want exposure to the future, but I’m not going all in or buying at the top.That part is my “high upside but high risk” long term bet. The rest stays diversified cyclicals, value, defensive names, low valuation sectors as the hedge.I’m not putting all my hopes into a single sector. And mentally, I’m prepared If tech swings hard, I’m not going to panic sell or blindly average down. If valuations correct to a reasonable level, I’d consider buying more in small batches. So what about you?For the 2026 U.S. market, are you leaning more toward:the bull continues”or sharp pullback ， big volatility”? Will you keep betting on tech and AI? Or play it safer with more defensive positioning? What kind of split would you choose? And which risks worry you the most",

      "selftext_processed": "Lately I ’ ve been thinking about one big question Is there still room for the market to run next year Wall Street is getting pretty bullish about 2026 but I keep wondering is this bull run going to continue or are we already at the peak A bunch of investment banks are betting that U.S. stocks could push higher next year . For example Deutsche Bank set their SP 500 target at 8000 by the end of 2026 saying AI driven capex corporate earnings growth and fresh capital inflows could fuel another big leg up . Morgan Stanley thinks even if tech stocks get choppy the overall market could still perform well thanks to rates fiscal policy and a rebound in more traditional sectors . Put simply the bulls believe，AI is no_longer just a hype story it ’ s actually turning into the foundation of economic and corporate growth . As long as AI keeps improving efficiency and there ’ s still liquidity in the market stocks could keep climbing . But I ’ m also seeing some big red flags Most leading tech and AI names are already expensive and overall market valuations are pretty high too On top of that the market right now is way too dependent on a handful of mega cap tech names If those companies disappoint or the AI hype cools off the entire market could get hit hard . And then there ’ s 2026 which might come with a whole bunch of uncertainties . This current structure of high concentration high valuations weak diversification makes me uneasy . History shows that bull markets can get derailed quickly by changes in the macro environment politics or interest rates no_matter how strong the bull feels . So here ’ s my approach going into 2026， I ’ ll put some money into tech AI high growth ，I want exposure to the future but I ’ m not_going all in or buying at the top.That part is my “ high upside but high risk ” long term bet . The rest stays diversified cyclicals value defensive names low valuation sectors as the hedge.I ’ m not_putting all my hopes into a single sector . And mentally I ’ m prepared If tech swings hard I ’ m not_going to panic sell or blindly average down . If valuations correct to a reasonable level I ’ d consider buying more in small batches . So what about youFor the 2026 U.S. market are you leaning more towardthe bull continues ” or sharp pullback ， big volatility ” Will you keep betting on tech and AI Or play it safer with more defensive positioning What kind of split would you choose And which risks worry you the most"

      "selftext": "Tesla shared updates this week suggesting that its unsupervised Full Self-Driving system is nearing completion, with Elon Musk saying the company is making meaningful progress toward removing the need for human supervision. Around the same time, Tesla also rolled out fresh incentives on the Model Y to support demand, which helped the stock move about 2.5% higher on the day. While neither development is completely new on its own FSD timelines have shifted before and incentives have been used frequently the combination of software progress and sales support seems to be keeping investor sentiment steady for now. It also highlights Tesla’s continued shift toward positioning itself as more than just an EV company, leaning further into AI and autonomy while trying to protect delivery volumes in a competitive market. Curious how others are viewing this: meaningful progress this time, or just another step in a long roadmap?",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving tech unit, expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year, aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan. It’s the first time that the company, which started in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car project, has set a hard target for its business. >Currently, the Mountain View, California-based company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Bay Area communities, Austin, Atlanta and, as of last month, Miami. That’s “a number that we’re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026,” Waymo said in a blog post. “As we look to 2026, we’re laying the early groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including international cities like Tokyo and London.” >Waymo doesn’t share financial data, but various estimates suggest it makes at least $20 per ride, which adds up to more than $20 million a month. At 1 million rides per week, its annualized revenue would hit about $1 billion, a milestone for the early-stage robotaxi market. To handle that volume of rides the company’s fleet will likely expand to at least 10,000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2,500 now, likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar I-Pace SUVs. >Though the service has proved popular with riders, Waymo’s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges. The company’s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco, for example, following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat, a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors. Last month, a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street. Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company, which hasn’t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans, needs to make additional safety upgrades. >Additionally, Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses. >“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s Waymo's chief safety officer, said in a statement. >That said, Waymo’s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space, including General Motors’ Cruise unit, which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco. Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving, is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its so-called Full Self-Driving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use. Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it’s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD. >But while Waymo’s safety issues so far haven’t been as serious, some critics think it’s expanding too fast, perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit. >“We are left to wonder why the \\`world’s most experienced driver’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience,” Phil Koopman, an autonomous driving researcher and Carnegie-Mellon University professor, said in a blog post. “Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can’t shrug off. It’s unclear which will happen first.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Waymo Alphabet Inc. ’ s selfdriving tech unit expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan . It ’ s the first time that the company which started in 2009 as the Google SelfDriving Car project has set a hard target for its business . Currently the Mountain View Californiabased company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix Los Angeles San Francisco and Bay Area communities Austin Atlanta and as of last month Miami . That ’ s “ a number that we ’ re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026 ” Waymo said in a blog post . “ As we look to 2026 we ’ re laying the early groundwork for ridehailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026 including international cities like Tokyo and London. ” Waymo doesn ’ t share financial data but various estimates suggest it makes at least $ 20 per ride which adds up to more than $ 20 million a month . At 1 million rides per week its annualized revenue would hit about $ 1 billion a milestone for the earlystage robotaxi market . To handle that volume of rides the company ’ s fleet will likely expand to at least 10000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2500 now likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar IPace SUVs . Though the service has proved popular with riders Waymo ’ s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges . The company ’ s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco for example following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors . Last month a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street . Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company which hasn ’ t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans needs to make additional safety upgrades . Additionally Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses . “ While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better ” Mauricio Peña Waymo ’ s Waymos chief safety officer said in a statement . That said Waymo ’ s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space including General Motors ’ Cruise unit which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco . Tesla whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its socalled Full SelfDriving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use . Last week the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it ’ s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD . But while Waymo ’ s safety issues so far haven ’ t been as serious some critics think it ’ s expanding too fast perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit . “ We are left to wonder why the world ’ s most experienced driver ’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience ” Phil Koopman an autonomous driving researcher and CarnegieMellon University professor said in a blog post . “ Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can ’ t shrug off . It ’ s unclear which will happen first ."

      "selftext": "I could use some feedback from a potential strategy I'm considering. For context, before the 2020 election I was fairly certain Biden would win the election, which would start a bullish cycle for domestic and other cannabis stocks based on the belief he would possibly legalize, or enact positive regulation in the sector vs a Trump election win. I built up a sizeable position and rode the wave to the 2021 highs of the cannabis sector and made a good profit. Now that the prices of MSOS and other cannabis stocks have fallen steeply since 2021 I'm considering opening a long dated MSOS ETF call dated for 2028 exp. My reasoning is that as we get closer to the 2028 election and IF (big if) a strong democratic candidate emerges that could possibly win the 2028 election, the cannabis sector will start another bull cycle in anticipation of this, and in anticipation of potential federal legalization promises or hints, and or SAFE banking act passage, and in general a democratic admin not hostile to the sector and pro-cannabis legislation. My thought is if I can open this long dated call which right now is not very expensive, by the time 2028 nears the call will possibly appreciate sharply going into the election and beyond. I'm interested to hear thoughts on this potential strategy. I am aware this thesis is based on a lot of uncertainty, and hinges on democrats winning the 2028 presidential election amongst many other things that could not come to pass.",

      "selftext": "I'm shorting this optimism. Everyone is glued to the screen waiting for the Fed to cut rates today, acting like it’s a foregone conclusion, and analysts are talking about S&P 500 hitting 7,500 in 2026. That's pure euphoria. I look at one stock: Tesla (TSLA). Michael Burry, the \"Big Short\" investor, recently called the company \"ridiculously overvalued,\" citing shareholder dilution from stock-based compensation (SBC) and no buyback program. 1 - The Growth Narrative is Broken: The stock's valuation requires insane, uninterrupted growth, but the truck design is already controversial, and the competition is accelerating. It has an AI valuation but is fundamentally a car company. 2 - The EPS Overestimation: The bottom-up EPS estimate for the S&P 500 for 2026 is currently \\$309.22. However, over the past 25 years, analysts have overestimated the final EPS number by an average of 6.2\\%. Applying that average means the final 2026 EPS might be closer to \\$290.11. This makes current high valuations extremely sensitive to any shock. The market is showing extreme crowding and a \"winner-takes-all\" dynamic right now. When the high-momentum stocks like TSLA and other AI names start the rotation, the correction will be deep. I'm taking profits today. I’m not saying crash, but 25-30% pullback in 2026 is my base case. Roast me. Important Note: I am not a financial advisor.

However over the past 25 years analysts have overestimated the final EPS number by an average of 6.2 % . Applying that average means the final 2026 EPS might be closer to $ 290.11 . This makes current high valuations extremely sensitive to any shock . The market is showing extreme crowding and a winnertakesall dynamic right now . When the highmomentum stocks like TSLA and other AI names start the rotation the correction will be deep . Im taking profits today . I ’ m not_saying crash but 2530 % pullback in 2026 is my base case . Roast me . Important Note I am not_a financial advisor .

      "selftext": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year’s market outlook will be. So let’s study Wall Street’s latest New Year forecasts together. The market has really been wild lately. One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia’s earnings, thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years, and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google. The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half. So the question is: how long can this wave last? After this round of Christmas gains, will next year keep taking off or fall flat? Every year end, those suit-and-tie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year. This year, I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish. Eternal bull market. The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank. They boldly claim the S&P 500 could reach 8000 points next year, nearly a 20% increase. Keep in mind, the S&P has already risen more than 10% this year, and they still want more. Why so optimistic? It basically comes down to two words: Artificial Intelligence. AI is no longer just a tech buzzword. It has become the engine of the entire capital market. Nvidia, Microsoft, Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI R&D. Capital expenditure is at record highs. Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution. But here’s the problem the S&P 500 is now trading at a 25x P/E ratio, while the historical average is just above 15. Isn’t that expensive? It definitely is. But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don’t expand further, they can stay high. Why? Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong. Money is still flowing into equities, corporate buybacks haven’t stopped, and earnings expectations are rising. They even predict that in In 2026, EPS could reach $320. Interestingly, Morgan Stanley is also bullish, targeting 7800 points, yet they didn’t buy the Magnificent Seven. Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market. They prefer small caps, consumer discretionary, healthcare, financials, and industrials. Why? Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors, and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods. This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase. More importantly, Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early. The logic is simple: if employment weakens, liquidity tightens, and risk assets fall, Powell won’t be able to hold he’ll have to pump liquidity back into the market. Once rates turn down, the valuation ceiling opens again. HSBC, Barclays, and UBS all agree. HSBC even said: who cares if there’s a bubble? The dot-com bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first. UBS even drew a bull scenario where the S&P hits 8400. But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation. Capital spending is no longer only on AI chips it’s spreading across more industries. From my perspective, the U.S. market is still the top priority next year, but we shouldn’t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump’s second year in office. You might not know this, but historically, the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks. In 2018, during Trump 1.0’s second year, the first half was great, then the market collapsed in the second half. The trade war began, tech stocks plunged, the VIX soared 70%, and even crypto and emerging markets crashed. And now? The script looks nearly identical. Policies change every day. Tariffs can hit at any time. Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes, the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers, retailers, and exporters lose sleep. Plus, the 2026 midterm elections are coming. Both parties will go all-out, meaning fiscal policy may freeze again, and market trust in the government will keep eroding. What’s worse, sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017. In the U.S., only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market. Materials, energy, real estate everything else is dropping. Europe isn’t much better. Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump. When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant, it signals a fragile market. If tech stocks cool off, the entire market could lose momentum instantly. So next year, political cycles, policy risks, and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won’t disappear. Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth. Wanting everything at once often ends badly. In my view, the script may look like this: First half: AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again. Second half: As midterm elections approach, policy noise increases, earnings get disrupted, and volatility returns. Whoever holds high valuation, low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year ’ s market outlook will be . So let ’ s study Wall Street ’ s latest New Year forecasts together . The market has really been wild lately . One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia ’ s earnings thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google . The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half . So the question is how long can this wave last After this round of Christmas gains will next year keep taking off or fall flat Every year end those suitandtie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year . This year I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish . Eternal bull market . The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank . They boldly claim the SP 500 could reach 8000 points next year nearly a 20 % increase . Keep in mind the SP has already risen more than 10 % this year and they still want more . Why so optimistic It basically comes down to two words Artificial Intelligence . AI is no_longer just a tech buzzword . It has become the engine of the entire capital market . Nvidia Microsoft Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI RD . Capital expenditure is at record highs . Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution . But here ’ s the problem the SP 500 is now trading at a 25x PE ratio while the historical average is just above 15 . Isn ’ t that expensive It definitely is . But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don ’ t expand further they can stay high . Why Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong . Money is still flowing into equities corporate buybacks haven ’ t stopped and earnings expectations are rising . They even predict that in In 2026 EPS could reach $ 320 . Interestingly Morgan Stanley is also bullish targeting 7800 points yet they didn ’ t buy the Magnificent Seven . Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market . They prefer small caps consumer discretionary healthcare financials and industrials . Why Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods . This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase . More importantly Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early . The logic is simple if employment weakens liquidity tightens and risk assets fall Powell won ’ t be able to hold he ’ ll have to pump liquidity back into the market . Once rates turn down the valuation ceiling opens again . HSBC Barclays and UBS all agree . HSBC even said who cares if there ’ s a bubble The dotcom bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first . UBS even drew a bull scenario where the SP hits 8400 . But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation . Capital spending is no_longer only on AI chips it ’ s spreading across more industries . From my perspective the U.S. market is still the top priority next year but we shouldn ’ t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump ’ s second year in office . You might not_know this but historically the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks . In 2018 during Trump 1.0 ’ s second year the first half was great then the market collapsed in the second half . The trade war began tech stocks plunged the VIX soared 70 % and even crypto and emerging markets crashed . And now The script looks nearly identical . Policies change every day . Tariffs can hit at any time . Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers retailers and exporters lose sleep . Plus the 2026 midterm elections are coming . Both parties will go allout meaning fiscal policy may freeze again and market trust in the government will keep eroding . What ’ s worse sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017 . In the U.S. only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market . Materials energy real estate everything else is dropping . Europe isn ’ t much better . Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump . When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant it signals a fragile market . If tech stocks cool off the entire market could lose momentum instantly . So next year political cycles policy risks and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won ’ t disappear . Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth . Wanting everything at once often ends badly . In my view the script may look like this First half AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again . Second half As midterm elections approach policy noise increases earnings get disrupted and volatility returns . Whoever holds high valuation low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk ."

      "selftext": "I just learned this today, so maybe I'm slow. I've never really looked into how the Dow is constructed or what companies made up the Dow 30. I assumed that, because it was referred to as the \"industrial average,\" that it was basically an \"ex-tech\" index. That isn't true. What was more surprising, though, was finding out it's weighted by stock price. This doesn't make any sense, as far as I can tell. Why is this? Does this just exist from a time before stock splits existed? It just seems weird that a company could technically go from being the highest weighted position in the Dow to the lowest, simply by splitting it's stock.",

I assumed that because it was referred to as the industrial average that it was basically an extech index . That isnt true . What was more surprising though was finding out its weighted by stock price . This doesnt make any sense as far as I can tell . Why is this Does this just exist from a time before stock splits existed It just seems weird that a company could technically go from being the highest weighted position in the Dow to the lowest simply by splitting its stock ."

      "title": "2026 Stock Market Outlook: How Long Can the AI Hype Last Amid Policy Risks and Election Uncertainty?",
      "selftext": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year’s market outlook will be. So let’s study Wall Street’s latest New Year forecasts together. The market has really been wild lately. One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia’s earnings, thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years, and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google. The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half. So the question is: how long can this wave last? After this round of Christmas gains, will next year keep taking off or fall flat? Every year end, those suit-and-tie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year. This year, I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish. Eternal bull market. The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank. They boldly claim the S&P 500 could reach 8000 points next year, nearly a 20% increase. Keep in mind, the S&P has already risen more than 10% this year, and they still want more. Why so optimistic? It basically comes down to two words: Artificial Intelligence. AI is no longer just a tech buzzword. It has become the engine of the entire capital market. Nvidia, Microsoft, Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI R&D. Capital expenditure is at record highs. Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution. But here’s the problem the S&P 500 is now trading at a 25x P/E ratio, while the historical average is just above 15. Isn’t that expensive? It definitely is. But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don’t expand further, they can stay high. Why? Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong. Money is still flowing into equities, corporate buybacks haven’t stopped, and earnings expectations are rising. They even predict that in In 2026, EPS could reach $320. Interestingly, Morgan Stanley is also bullish, targeting 7800 points, yet they didn’t buy the Magnificent Seven. Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market. They prefer small caps, consumer discretionary, healthcare, financials, and industrials. Why? Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors, and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods. This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase. More importantly, Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early. The logic is simple: if employment weakens, liquidity tightens, and risk assets fall, Powell won’t be able to hold he’ll have to pump liquidity back into the market. Once rates turn down, the valuation ceiling opens again. HSBC, Barclays, and UBS all agree. HSBC even said: who cares if there’s a bubble? The dot-com bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first. UBS even drew a bull scenario where the S&P hits 8400. But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation. Capital spending is no longer only on AI chips it’s spreading across more industries. From my perspective, the U.S. market is still the top priority next year, but we shouldn’t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump’s second year in office. You might not know this, but historically, the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks. In 2018, during Trump 1.0’s second year, the first half was great, then the market collapsed in the second half. The trade war began, tech stocks plunged, the VIX soared 70%, and even crypto and emerging markets crashed. And now? The script looks nearly identical. Policies change every day. Tariffs can hit at any time. Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes, the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers, retailers, and exporters lose sleep. Plus, the 2026 midterm elections are coming. Both parties will go all-out, meaning fiscal policy may freeze again, and market trust in the government will keep eroding. What’s worse, sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017. In the U.S., only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market. Materials, energy, real estate everything else is dropping. Europe isn’t much better. Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump. When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant, it signals a fragile market. If tech stocks cool off, the entire market could lose momentum instantly. So next year, political cycles, policy risks, and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won’t disappear. Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth. Wanting everything at once often ends badly. In my view, the script may look like this: First half: AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again. Second half: As midterm elections approach, policy noise increases, earnings get disrupted, and volatility returns. Whoever holds high valuation, low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year ’ s market outlook will be . So let ’ s study Wall Street ’ s latest New Year forecasts together . The market has really been wild lately . One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia ’ s earnings thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google . The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half . So the question is how long can this wave last After this round of Christmas gains will next year keep taking off or fall flat Every year end those suitandtie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year . This year I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish . Eternal bull market . The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank . They boldly claim the SP 500 could reach 8000 points next year nearly a 20 % increase . Keep in mind the SP has already risen more than 10 % this year and they still want more . Why so optimistic It basically comes down to two words Artificial Intelligence . AI is no_longer just a tech buzzword . It has become the engine of the entire capital market . Nvidia Microsoft Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI RD . Capital expenditure is at record highs . Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution . But here ’ s the problem the SP 500 is now trading at a 25x PE ratio while the historical average is just above 15 . Isn ’ t that expensive It definitely is . But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don ’ t expand further they can stay high . Why Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong . Money is still flowing into equities corporate buybacks haven ’ t stopped and earnings expectations are rising . They even predict that in In 2026 EPS could reach $ 320 . Interestingly Morgan Stanley is also bullish targeting 7800 points yet they didn ’ t buy the Magnificent Seven . Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market . They prefer small caps consumer discretionary healthcare financials and industrials . Why Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods . This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase . More importantly Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early . The logic is simple if employment weakens liquidity tightens and risk assets fall Powell won ’ t be able to hold he ’ ll have to pump liquidity back into the market . Once rates turn down the valuation ceiling opens again . HSBC Barclays and UBS all agree . HSBC even said who cares if there ’ s a bubble The dotcom bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first . UBS even drew a bull scenario where the SP hits 8400 . But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation . Capital spending is no_longer only on AI chips it ’ s spreading across more industries . From my perspective the U.S. market is still the top priority next year but we shouldn ’ t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump ’ s second year in office . You might not_know this but historically the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks . In 2018 during Trump 1.0 ’ s second year the first half was great then the market collapsed in the second half . The trade war began tech stocks plunged the VIX soared 70 % and even crypto and emerging markets crashed . And now The script looks nearly identical . Policies change every day . Tariffs can hit at any time . Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers retailers and exporters lose sleep . Plus the 2026 midterm elections are coming . Both parties will go allout meaning fiscal policy may freeze again and market trust in the government will keep eroding . What ’ s worse sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017 . In the U.S. only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market . Materials energy real estate everything else is dropping . Europe isn ’ t much better . Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump . When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant it signals a fragile market . If tech stocks cool off the entire market could lose momentum instantly . So next year political cycles policy risks and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won ’ t disappear . Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth . Wanting everything at once often ends badly . In my view the script may look like this First half AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again . Second half As midterm elections approach policy noise increases earnings get disrupted and volatility returns . Whoever holds high valuation low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk ."

I like my girls, I mean my stocks, ugly. I don’t like to compete for the hot and sexy Instagram models types. Lack of self-esteem or just pure self-awareness? I will go for the second option. I am a lazy guy and I like going on cheap dates. Same thing goes for my stock selection. WPP is marred with a seemingly unsustainable debt, it has lost its leading position in the Ad industry to the more nimble AI-focused Publicis. The stock is down 80% over a decade, selling below its 2008 lows. Shareholders are suing the company, a fired exec has followed suit. A new tech-centric CEO had been hired with the hope of aligning the company with the structural reality of data and AI. Thousands of jobs are on the line of fire and more assets stripping may be required to trim down the debt. The stock is cheap, reasonably so. But I believe the market also is overreacting and overstretching WPP troubles. The company’s legacy, assets, and revenues prove still rank the company at the top end of its industry. WPP is still printing cash, its list of loyal clients a thing of envy by its competitors. Cindy Rose’s tech background looks like a wise choice given the company’s need for flexibility and adaptability to the market AI revenues-driven reality. Will she deliver? Only the future will tell. But given the level of negative sentiment, I deem the company worthy of a second look. They say the beauty is in the eye of the beholder, well, I prefer my stocks for their inner beauty, and care little for the outside appearance. WPP had been a market leader in the Ad world for nearly 50 years and I don’t see the company disappearing without a fight. There is still a lot of juice left in its tank, and I am confident in Cindy Rose’s ability to turn the ship around. At worst, she will probably do enough cleaning to make its balance sheet worthy of a takeover bid. I am buying “this girl” some flowers.",

I like my girls I mean my stocks ugly . I don ’ t like to compete for the hot and sexy Instagram models types . Lack of selfesteem or just pure selfawareness I will go for the second option . I am a lazy guy and I like going on cheap dates . Same thing goes for my stock selection . WPP is marred with a seemingly unsustainable debt it has lost its leading position in the Ad industry to the more nimble AIfocused Publicis . The stock is down 80 % over a decade selling below its 2008 lows . Shareholders are suing the company a fired exec has followed suit . A new techcentric CEO had been hired with the hope of aligning the company with the structural reality of data and AI . Thousands of jobs are on the line of fire and more assets stripping may be required to trim down the debt . The stock is cheap reasonably so . But I believe the market also is overreacting and overstretching WPP troubles . The company ’ s legacy assets and revenues prove still rank the company at the top end of its industry . WPP is still printing cash its list of loyal clients a thing of envy by its competitors . Cindy Rose ’ s tech background looks like a wise choice given the company ’ s need for flexibility and adaptability to the market AI revenuesdriven reality . Will she deliver Only the future will tell . But given the level of negative sentiment I deem the company worthy of a second look . They say the beauty is in the eye of the beholder well I prefer my stocks for their inner beauty and care little for the outside appearance . WPP had been a market leader in the Ad world for nearly 50 years and I don ’ t see the company disappearing without a fight . There is still a lot of juice left in its tank and I am confident in Cindy Rose ’ s ability to turn the ship around . At worst she will probably do enough cleaning to make its balance sheet worthy of a takeover bid . I am buying “ this girl ” some flowers ."

Traders are largely in wait-and-see mode ahead of the Federal Reserve’s rate decision at 2 p.m. ET, where a widely expected rate cut is already priced in. The real focus is on the tone of the Fed’s commentary, which many worry could lean more hawkish on future easing. GE Vernova shares edged higher after the company issued a strong 2026 revenue outlook, while Oracle and Broadcom earnings are due later in the day and may help set the tone for tech. Overall, this Fed meeting is shaping up to be one of the most divided in recent years, as policymakers try to strike a balance between supporting a softening labor market and avoiding any rekindling of inflation pressures.

Over the last few months, I have withdrawn or sold off shares a few times at a small profit when I needed money. Like last week, I needed $5k, I sold a bit, and boom, I had it the next day. Yesterday, I just happened to have a very good day financially and made $9k. I'm going to take my cost from it and pay for my guys and put the rest right back in. My question is, does anyone else find themselves doing this, and if so, is it smart? What are your opinions?",

      "selftext": "Amazon announced it will invest over $35 billion in India and create 1 million jobs by 2030. This represents a significant commitment, clearly signaling a long term dedication to deepening its presence in India. This move appears to have dual implications for Amazon: Positives: India's e-commerce demand continues to grow rapidly. Large scale investment could accelerate Amazon's market share and logistics advantages locally. Long term, it may become a new growth engine. Risks: The massive investment and long return cycle, coupled with India's intense competition and complex regulations, may not necessarily translate into profits. The short term boost to stock prices could also be limited. I see this as a classic case of long term upside with short term uncertainty. Does this news make you more optimistic about AMZN's long term value? If you're a shareholder, would you increase your position or remain cautious?",

Basically I’m pretty sure I can afford that much weekly but if I feel financial pressure I will get it down to 200£, but this is in the case but let’s start on 250£. I have seen many opinions that I should start with SP500 - VUAG, but on the other hand have seen people giving an idea to diversify into world for example or some small % to the gold. I have two questions; as I’m using trading212, for example if someone mentioned ticker VT is that means on my app/market(UK) VT will be exactly the same like in USA market for example? Another question what do you think what strategy on my place would be the best with % allocation and any ideas what to look for? Thank you so much!",

Basically I ’ m pretty sure I can afford that much weekly but if I feel financial pressure I will get it down to 200£ but this is in the case but let ’ s start on 250£ . I have seen many opinions that I should start with SP500 VUAG but on the other hand have seen people giving an idea to diversify into world for example or some small % to the gold . I have two questions as I ’ m using trading212 for example if someone mentioned ticker VT is that means on my appmarketUK VT will be exactly the same like in USA market for example Another question what do you think what strategy on my place would be the best with % allocation and any ideas what to look for Thank you so much"

WeRide received L4 driverless city permit in Abu Dhabi, outside of US. They turned their permits and reg approvals into real operating advantage. We can clearly see that WeRide is the first mover and leader in those countries. Working with Grab and Uber to operate their fleets gives them an access to huge target bases. Also, WeRide enters ADAS market, partnered with Bosch gives them more credibility in the auto market. Institutional side: recently, ARK Invest purchased 858,295 shares of WeRide and extra 17,326 shares bia ARKQ. BofA, City and BOCI all applied a BUY rating on this stock, showing a long-term confidence in them. Their shareholders include: Fidelity, Greenwoods, Hudson Bay, Invesco, M&G, Mirae Asset, Morgan Stanley IM, Temasek, and NVIDIA. This is a super heavy capital industry and not cheap to operate. It's not realistic to expect them to have profits right away. However, when you look closely into their strategy, their partnerships and especially their Q3 performance, you can see the numbers have been improving quarter to quarter. Imo, this company is having a huge potential in the whole auto space in the next few years, they doing the real things instead of saying and doing nothing on press.",

WeRide received L4 driverless city permit in Abu Dhabi outside of US . They turned their permits and reg approvals into real operating advantage . We can clearly see that WeRide is the first mover and leader in those countries . Working with Grab and Uber to operate their fleets gives them an access to huge target bases . Also WeRide enters ADAS market partnered with Bosch gives them more credibility in the auto market . Institutional side recently ARK Invest purchased 858295 shares of WeRide and extra 17326 shares bia ARKQ . BofA City and BOCI all applied a BUY rating on this stock showing a longterm confidence in them . Their shareholders include Fidelity Greenwoods Hudson Bay Invesco MG Mirae Asset Morgan Stanley IM Temasek and NVIDIA . This is a super heavy capital industry and not_cheap to operate . Its not_realistic to expect them to have profits right away . However when you look closely into their strategy their partnerships and especially their Q3 performance you can see the numbers have been improving quarter to quarter . Imo this company is having a huge potential in the whole auto space in the next few years they doing the real things instead of saying and doing nothing_on press ."

      "selftext": "Hello everyone. I kindly ask if anyone could give me their opinion on this splendid but suffering stock. I invested at the beginning of the year, so I am currently at a significant loss. I have averaged several times, bringing me to a price of around €366 per PMC. At the moment, I am seriously wondering whether it makes sense to: \\- hold the position \\- increase it \\- give up and take the loss. What are you doing? Looking at the company's financial statements over the last few years, I see stability and growth, so I don't understand why it has fallen almost 30% from its highs in such a short time. Please don't tell me I should look at the PE ratio compared to the automotive sector because Ferrari has never played in that league, at least as far as the public is concerned. Many thanks in advance to everyone.",

      "title": "Global Bond Yields Hit 16-Year High on Fading Rate-Cut Bets",
      "selftext": "Global bond markets flashed a warning signal ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Long-dated government bond yields have climbed to levels last seen in 2009, suggesting traders are starting to question whether the era of broad rate-cut cycles is actually ending. A Bloomberg index tracking long-term sovereign yields is now back at 16-year highs. Futures markets reflect that shift: expectations for additional cuts from the European Central Bank have essentially vanished, Japan is seen as almost certain to hike this month, and Australia is now priced for two more quarter-point increases next year. The move comes just as the Fed prepares to announce its next decision. While most investors still expect a cut on Wednesday, the broader message from global markets is that easing may not last as long or run as deep as previously hoped. Anyone else watching this tightening narrative re-emerge? Bond markets usually sniff out trends early, and this feels like a meaningful shift. Source: [",

The increase is being driven by tougher competition in the credit card business and heavier spending on artificial intelligence across the firm. The drop made JPMorgan the biggest loser in the Dow for the session and marked its worst one-day decline since early April. Investors seem to be reacting more to the cost outlook than to near-term earnings strength, with margins and future profitability now back in focus. Source: [",

The increase is being driven by tougher competition in the credit card business and heavier spending on artificial intelligence across the firm . The drop made JPMorgan the biggest loser in the Dow for the session and marked its worst oneday decline since early April . Investors seem to be reacting more to the cost outlook than to nearterm earnings strength with margins and future profitability now back in focus . Source"

No options, timing the market with trades or any penny stocks. Just good solid companies for the long-term. I looked at Target (TGT) and it's way down from the past 5 years, currently pays 5% dividend, which has not been cut in the past 50 years which makes it a dividend aristocrat. It also has a 11 P/E Ratio currently from being over-sold and political drama the past few years. But I'm looking for more companies like that to checkout as well, if anyone has any pointers.",

I have a $50,000 position. Additionally, if you own at least $40,000, you get an invite to their annual investment conference in NYC where Elon musk is regularly a guest speaker. I went this year and heard him talk. Last year Gwyneth Shotwell, COO of SpaceX spoke on stage.

      "selftext": "Former Okta employee (3 years). Great experience/comp, but I’ve watched this stock behave in a way that doesn’t match a “category-defining” IAM name. Not here to pump. I’m trying to understand what the market is pricing in for the next 12–36 months. Context I remember: • OKTA fell hard from prior highs to the 70s/60s in 2022. • Security-related headlines + weak/incomplete messaging seemed to wreck confidence. • Auth0 (~$6.5B) was widely viewed as an overpay and the synergy story felt slow. The pattern: 1. OKTA reports 2. Beats estimates 3. Stock pops 4. Then fades under $100 5. Drifts back into the 80s Feels like a trust/narrative discount more than just fundamentals. My key questions: • What’s the real bear case today? • Is Microsoft bundle risk the main overhang? • Is Auth0 still a drag or turning into an asset? • Why do CRWD/Zscaler get premium multiples while OKTA can’t hold $100+? • What would trigger a durable re-rate to $120–$150+?",

Not_here to pump . I ’ m trying to understand what the market is pricing in for the next 12–36 months . Context I remember • OKTA fell hard from prior highs to the 70s60s in 2022 . • Securityrelated headlines weakincomplete messaging seemed to wreck confidence . • Auth0 $ 6.5B was widely viewed as an overpay and the synergy story felt slow . The pattern 1 . OKTA reports 2 . Beats estimates 3 . Stock pops 4 . Then fades under $ 100 5 . Drifts back into the 80s Feels like a trustnarrative discount more than just fundamentals . My key questions • What ’ s the real bear case today • Is Microsoft bundle risk the main overhang • Is Auth0 still a drag or turning into an asset • Why do CRWDZscaler get premium multiples while OKTA can ’ t hold $ 100 • What would trigger a durable rerate to $ 120– $ 150"

      "selftext": "[ Morningstar has updated their coverage on Nvidia Corp, after he company received a significant policy win after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the company will be permitted to resume selling its H200 AI accelerators, a roughly two-year-old generation of AI GPUs into the Chinese market. Although the U.S. government will impose a 25% revenue cut on Nvidia’s China H200 sales, higher than the previously discussed 15%, Morningstar sees this as an important step toward rebuilding Nvidia’s China AI business. Morningstar emphasizes that this development helps establish a clearer path for future revenue growth from China, a market that contributed meaningfully to Nvidia’s data-center GPU sales prior to U.S. export restrictions. However, the firm cautions that policy uncertainty remains high, and future reversals or additional restrictions cannot be ruled out. At the same time, Morningstar notes that China’s government has recently encouraged domestic AI developers to shift away from Nvidia components in favor of local alternatives. As a result, the H200’s adoption in China is not guaranteed, despite its superior performance compared with the lower-end H20 model previously approved for sale. Still, Trump’s statement that President Xi “responded positively” suggests that some level of cooperation may help Nvidia regain traction in the region. Despite the geopolitical back-and-forth, Morningstar is maintaining its $240 fair value estimate for wide-moat Nvidia, arguing that the shares remain undervalued relative to long-term fundamentals. Morningstar sees the recent selloff in AI-driven stocks as a buying opportunity for investors who can tolerate volatility. The research firm continues to assign certain aspects in the sector with uncertainty, reflecting the numerous variables influencing the company’s future, such ad U.S.-China policy tensions, global AI chip demand, competitive dynamics, and technological progress in large language models and hyperscale infrastructure. Morningstar specifically highlights the strength of Google’s Gemini AI model, which leverages Google’s in-house silicon, as a competitive risk that could affect Nvidia’s dominance in AI accelerators over time. Overall, Morningstar views the U.S. approval for H200 China sales as a positive but measured step for Nvidia, acknowledging both the revenue upside and the geopolitical risks that continue to shape the firm’s long-term outlook.",

      "selftext_processed": "Morningstar has updated their coverage on Nvidia Corp after he company received a significant policy win after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the company will be permitted to resume selling its H200 AI accelerators a roughly twoyearold generation of AI GPUs into the Chinese market . Although the U.S. government will impose a 25 % revenue cut on Nvidia ’ s China H200 sales higher than the previously discussed 15 % Morningstar sees this as an important step toward rebuilding Nvidia ’ s China AI business . Morningstar emphasizes that this development helps establish a clearer path for future revenue growth from China a market that contributed meaningfully to Nvidia ’ s datacenter GPU sales prior to U.S. export restrictions . However the firm cautions that policy uncertainty remains high and future reversals or additional restrictions can not be ruled out . At the same time Morningstar notes that China ’ s government has recently encouraged domestic AI developers to shift away from Nvidia components in favor of local alternatives . As a result the H200 ’ s adoption in China is not_guaranteed despite its superior performance compared with the lowerend H20 model previously approved for sale . Still Trump ’ s statement that President Xi “ responded positively ” suggests that some level of cooperation may help Nvidia regain traction in the region . Despite the geopolitical backandforth Morningstar is maintaining its $ 240 fair value estimate for widemoat Nvidia arguing that the shares remain undervalued relative to longterm fundamentals . Morningstar sees the recent selloff in AIdriven stocks as a buying opportunity for investors who can tolerate volatility . The research firm continues to assign certain aspects in the sector with uncertainty reflecting the numerous variables influencing the company ’ s future such ad U.S.China policy tensions global AI chip demand competitive dynamics and technological progress in large language models and hyperscale infrastructure . Morningstar specifically highlights the strength of Google ’ s Gemini AI model which leverages Google ’ s inhouse silicon as a competitive risk that could affect Nvidia ’ s dominance in AI accelerators over time . Overall Morningstar views the U.S. approval for H200 China sales as a positive but measured step for Nvidia acknowledging both the revenue upside and the geopolitical risks that continue to shape the firm ’ s longterm outlook ."

      "selftext": "Lately, the U.S. government has shown signs of easing restrictions on exporting high end AI chips to China. According to multiple media reports, the Trump administration has decided to allow NVDA to export its H200 chips to China, but under the condition that 25% of the revenue is taken as a fee. From a market perspective, if the H200 can legally be sold in China, it could be a major step for NVDA to regain access to the world’s largest AI market ， especially since export restrictions had previously caused its market share in China to drop to almost zero. And compared to the earlier H20 chip sold to China, the H200 is a big upgrade. However, even though it’s been approved, there are still a lot of uncertainties ，whether China will allow large scale purchases, whether there will be additional reviews, and whether concerns over security and domestic technology independence will lead to procurement limits. There are even reports suggesting that China may impose extra procedures or restrictions on H200 purchases. I believe global AI demand is still booming and NVDA long term fundamentals remain strong. But with China rapidly pushing for its own AI chip development, will the H200 still be welcomed by the market there? And could this be a good setup opportunity for NVDA and other U.S. chip stocks?",

      "selftext_processed": "Lately the U.S. government has shown signs of easing restrictions on exporting high end AI chips to China . According to multiple media reports the Trump administration has decided to allow NVDA to export its H200 chips to China but under the condition that 25 % of the revenue is taken as a fee . From a market perspective if the H200 can legally be sold in China it could be a major step for NVDA to regain access to the world ’ s largest AI market ， especially since export restrictions had previously caused its market share in China to drop to almost zero . And compared to the earlier H20 chip sold to China the H200 is a big upgrade . However even though it ’ s been approved there are still a lot of uncertainties ，whether China will allow large scale purchases whether there will be additional reviews and whether concerns over security and domestic technology independence will lead to procurement limits . There are even reports suggesting that China may impose extra procedures or restrictions on H200 purchases . I believe global AI demand is still booming and NVDA long term fundamentals remain strong . But with China rapidly pushing for its own AI chip development will the H200 still be welcomed by the market there And could this be a good setup opportunity for NVDA and other U.S. chip stocks"

      "selftext": "There's been a lot of talk lately about the Fed potentially cutting rates, but with the way things are going, I’m not so sure we’ll see that anytime soon. The economy’s holding up, but tech stocks, especially the high-valuation ones, are facing some serious pressure One big factor is the rise in job openings. More job vacancies are pushing up labor costs, which could hit companies that rely on high-paid talent the hardest. This is a problem for tech stocks, especially in a higher-rate environment where margins are already getting squeezed The other issue is wage inflation. When there’s a shortage of workers, businesses have to pay more to attract and keep talent, which can lead to rising prices across the board. And if that happens, inflation could start ticking up again. If job vacancies keep climbing, the Fed might have no choice but to delay rate cuts or even keep tightening until inflation is under control. It’s clear that they’re focused on inflation, and strong demand in the labor market is a big concern for them. So, I m curious how are you all thinking about this? Are you still bullish on tech, or are you adjusting your strategy given the pressure from higher labor costs and the Fed’s stance?",

      "selftext_processed": "Theres been a lot of talk lately about the Fed potentially cutting rates but with the way things are going I ’ m not_so sure we ’ ll see that anytime soon . The economy ’ s holding up but tech stocks especially the highvaluation ones are facing some serious pressure One big factor is the rise in job openings . More job vacancies are pushing up labor costs which could hit companies that rely on highpaid talent the hardest . This is a problem for tech stocks especially in a higherrate environment where margins are already getting squeezed The other issue is wage inflation . When there ’ s a shortage of workers businesses have to pay more to attract and keep talent which can lead to rising prices across the board . And if that happens inflation could start ticking up again . If job vacancies keep climbing the Fed might have no_choice but to delay rate cuts or even keep tightening until inflation is under control . It ’ s clear that they ’ re focused on inflation and strong demand in the labor market is a big concern for them . So I m curious how are you all thinking about this Are you still bullish on tech or are you adjusting your strategy given the pressure from higher labor costs and the Fed ’ s stance"

I opted for VUAA. I do roughly €200 a month, i recently did a large sump investment too. I am also looking into doing a small percentage into SXRT. Thats my main investments into the future. I am planning to keep around €6-7k as emergency fund in my bank and i have about another €7k I want to put into some sort of fund to at least cover 4% inflation. I looked into my bank and a normal savings account has 0.8-1.3% and they also have investment savings account. But with fees that amounts to about 2.7% and i cant touch the money for 12 months minimum. There are various other fees they also do. This doesn't seem viable for me. Also government bonds aren't available/worth it. I am learning and looking into MMFs, bond ETFs etc. People have recommended XEON, which gives around 2.3%. I am also looking to varioud Bond ETFs. For example ERNX. Which is about 2.6% However, i am looking for recommendations from people on what I could possibly do to get around 4% and attempt to cover inflation. I don't mind learning and managing various things or doing something more complicated to set it up. Open to all suggestions. I am based in Europe, Slovakia.",

Anyway through all this noise I keep hearing how Japan and their central banks and financial policy interests rates bond yields are somehow tied to the global economic landscape . But Im having trouble figuring out how Japan is connected . Im not_trying to sound ignorant Im just confused and not_able to understand how Japan might hold the keys to the economic driver seat . Is there anyone who is able to paint the picture for me in laymans terms"

      "selftext": "Figure Technologies mission is to build the future of capital markets using its L1 Provenance Blockchain and believes it can remove intermediaries to achieve pareto markets (i.e. lenders and borrowers are connected directly via blockchain without banks, clearinghouses, and brokers collecting rent on each transaction). The company IPO'd earlier this year at $25 per share behind their mortgage / HELOC platform, which promises “a better mortgage done on blockchain”. A mortgage done with Figure costs an avg of $730 and takes a median of 10 days to close, compared to industry avg mortgage costs $11.2K and 42 days to close. Figure can offer HELOC approvals in as little as five minutes and funding in as few as five days, and its platform automates 89% of loans from application through underwriting (i.e. borrower doesn’t need to talk to a human). Figure facilitated $6 billion of home equity lending on its platform in the past 12 months, up 29% from the prior year. For comparison, I am seeing JPM Chase originated \\~$38.2 billion and BoA originated \\~$29 billion, while leaders United Wholesale originated \\~$140 Billion in loans in 2024, and Rocket Mortgage \\~$100 Billion (publicly available sources). The point here is FIGR has some traction, but are not main-stream yet. Figure sees an $80 billion revenue opportunity for its Loan Origination and Distribution marketplace - based on $2 trillion of annual consumer loan origination estimate and 4% take rate. **Carvana analogy illustrates FIGR potential** If FIGR’s process works as well as they say it does, which so far it seems to, it is an unbelievably better and more accessible experience for every consumer – especially as people become increasingly more digital. Figure’s platform creates process efficiencies to digitize and automate the manual and paper-driven mortgage and lending process in a similar way to what Carvana (added to S&P 500 this month) did for the secondary auto market. If anyone has sold a used car on through Carvana vs a dealer, you know what I'm talking about. FIGR started with mortgages and HELOC’s, but are positioned to bring tokenized real-world assets and securities to the main stream. And unlike Carvana, FIGR maintains a capital light business model that decouples loan origination from balance sheet retention (i.e. it offers mortgage and HELOC loans and a marketplace to transact those securitized loans) – as of 9/30/2025 FIGR’s balance sheet shows $389 million in loans held for sale and facilitated $2.4 billion in quarterly HELOC originations. **FIGR had an excellent first earnings call as a public company** Highlights include 42% YoY revenue growth, 82% gross margin, and $2.5 billion in loan volume for the quarter +70% YoY and the company reported that HELOC lending volumes tripled YoY. FIGR also expanded its partner network to 246 entities, up from 168 in the S1 (as of 6/30/2025). The company also announced a first-of-its-kind the launch of a blockchain-native equity share class on the Provenance blockchain – basically an ICO for real equity shares. This has never been done before. **Traditional finance in the US needs blockchain to modernize** I am generally bullish on blockchain, stablecoins, and tokenized RWA becoming a part of traditional finance because it is unbelievable that in the US we operate on a payments and securities trading infrastructure that was built in the 70’s, and we still use physical paper throughout the mortgage and lending process (deeds and “wet ink” requirements). Today's regulatory environment makes now a great time to make progress here. Interchange fees are way too high and there are probably far too many intermediaries in traditional finance processes (i.e. they are unnecessarily complex and expensive). These processes are begging to be disrupted. Traditional finance has also been granted the greatest regulatory tailwinds in history through the current white house administration, so if blockchain is going to work, we should see some of the biggest progress as regulation and rules of the game are developed. **Conclusion** Figure, under Mike Cagney’s and Michael Tannenbaum’s leadership, are positioned well to be one of the [MAG 7]( to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance through both tokenizing real-world assets and securities as well as stablecoin. If you believe that Blockchain technology can upgrade capital markets and payments infrastructure in the US, FIGR seems to be positioned as one of the first to make this happen. Curious if anyone else has thoughts about FIGR or other plays bridging traditional finance and digital assets / blockchain! Not Investment Advice. All opinions are my own. I am long FIGR.",

      "selftext_processed": "Figure Technologies mission is to build the future of capital markets using its L1 Provenance Blockchain and believes it can remove intermediaries to achieve pareto markets i.e . lenders and borrowers are connected directly via blockchain without banks clearinghouses and brokers collecting rent on each transaction . The company IPOd earlier this year at $ 25 per share behind their mortgage HELOC platform which promises “ a better mortgage done on blockchain ” . A mortgage done with Figure costs an avg of $ 730 and takes a median of 10 days to close compared to industry avg mortgage costs $ 11.2K and 42 days to close . Figure can offer HELOC approvals in as little as five minutes and funding in as few as five days and its platform automates 89 % of loans from application through underwriting i.e . borrower doesn ’ t need to talk to a human . Figure facilitated $ 6 billion of home equity lending on its platform in the past 12 months up 29 % from the prior year . For comparison I am seeing JPM Chase originated $ 38.2 billion and BoA originated $ 29 billion while leaders United Wholesale originated $ 140 Billion in loans in 2024 and Rocket Mortgage $ 100 Billion publicly available sources . The point here is FIGR has some traction but are not_mainstream yet . Figure sees an $ 80 billion revenue opportunity for its Loan Origination and Distribution marketplace based on $ 2 trillion of annual consumer loan origination estimate and 4 % take rate . Carvana analogy illustrates FIGR potential If FIGR ’ s process works as well as they say it does which so far it seems to it is an unbelievably better and more accessible experience for every consumer – especially as people become increasingly more digital . Figure ’ s platform creates process efficiencies to digitize and automate the manual and paperdriven mortgage and lending process in a similar way to what Carvana added to SP 500 this month did for the secondary auto market . If anyone has sold a used car on through Carvana vs a dealer you know what Im talking about . FIGR started with mortgages and HELOC ’ s but are positioned to bring tokenized realworld assets and securities to the main stream . And unlike Carvana FIGR maintains a capital light business model that decouples loan origination from balance sheet retention i.e . it offers mortgage and HELOC loans and a marketplace to transact those securitized loans – as of 9302025 FIGR ’ s balance sheet shows $ 389 million in loans held for sale and facilitated $ 2.4 billion in quarterly HELOC originations . FIGR had an excellent first earnings call as a public company Highlights include 42 % YoY revenue growth 82 % gross margin and $ 2.5 billion in loan volume for the quarter 70 % YoY and the company reported that HELOC lending volumes tripled YoY . FIGR also expanded its partner network to 246 entities up from 168 in the S1 as of 6302025 . The company also announced a firstofitskind the launch of a blockchainnative equity share class on the Provenance blockchain – basically an ICO for real equity shares . This has never_been done before . Traditional finance in the US needs blockchain to modernize I am generally bullish on blockchain stablecoins and tokenized RWA becoming a part of traditional finance because it is unbelievable that in the US we operate on a payments and securities trading infrastructure that was built in the 70 ’ s and we still use physical paper throughout the mortgage and lending process deeds and “ wet ink ” requirements . Todays regulatory environment makes now a great time to make progress here . Interchange fees are way too high and there are probably far too many intermediaries in traditional finance processes i.e . they are unnecessarily complex and expensive . These processes are begging to be disrupted . Traditional finance has also been granted the greatest regulatory tailwinds in history through the current white house administration so if blockchain is going to work we should see some of the biggest progress as regulation and rules of the game are developed . Conclusion Figure under Mike Cagney ’ s and Michael Tannenbaum ’ s leadership are positioned well to be one of the MAG 7 to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance through both tokenizing realworld assets and securities as well as stablecoin . If you believe that Blockchain technology can upgrade capital markets and payments infrastructure in the US FIGR seems to be positioned as one of the first to make this happen . Curious if anyone else has thoughts about FIGR or other plays bridging traditional finance and digital assets blockchain Not_Investment Advice . All opinions are my own . I am long FIGR ."

      "title": "Trying To Understand Where Nvidia Really Stands As AI Demand Rises",
      "selftext": "Nvidia’s recent moves keep pulling me back into the conversation because every new detail seems to reshape the picture a little. The approval to sell H200 chips to China is one of those changes that feels bigger than the headlines make it. It unlocks a huge AI market again, even though the regulatory environment around them is tightening. The stock reacting with a 2% premarket jump shows how strongly investors still believe in the long term story. Their profitability numbers back that confidence. A gross margin of 70.05% and an operating margin of 58.84% tell me Nvidia still has the kind of breathing room most companies don’t get. Even the valuation is shifting in an interesting way. The P E ratio sliding from 48.89x to 45.63x and EV EBITDA moving from 41.39x to 38.29x makes it look less stretched than before, especially for a company sitting at the center of AI growth. The insider sales are the part I’m still trying to understand. Sixteen sales in total worth around $12.26M and not a single acquisition or award in that window. The CFO alone handled 25% of the total value, and one of her sales was more than 3% times her usual size. It could be perfect timing, it could be strategic, or it could just be routine for management. But the pattern stands out, and I can’t ignore it. Analysts don’t seem worried at all. Most targets range from $220 to $320 while the stock trades around $185.55. Cantor Fitzgerald sits at $300 with a high accuracy record, Bernstein at $275, and Melius goes all the way to $320. Even online discussions around rising volume show traders expecting something to build again while other uex like bitget are still pushing their users to trade more of it to keep securing their leading uex in tokenized choice for US stock trading in the space. Still, we have John Chambers saying 2026 will be a strong year for AI which adds another layer of expectation. My question is simple. Is Nvidia setting up for its next major run or are these insider moves a quiet signal that the current price already reflects a lot of the future.",

      "selftext_processed": "Nvidia ’ s recent moves keep pulling me back into the conversation because every new detail seems to reshape the picture a little . The approval to sell H200 chips to China is one of those changes that feels bigger than the headlines make it . It unlocks a huge AI market again even though the regulatory environment around them is tightening . The stock reacting with a 2 % premarket jump shows how strongly investors still believe in the long term story . Their profitability numbers back that confidence . A gross margin of 70.05 % and an operating margin of 58.84 % tell me Nvidia still has the kind of breathing room most companies don ’ t get . Even the valuation is shifting in an interesting way . The P E ratio sliding from 48.89x to 45.63x and EV EBITDA moving from 41.39x to 38.29x makes it look less stretched than before especially for a company sitting at the center of AI growth . The insider sales are the part I ’ m still trying to understand . Sixteen sales in total worth around $ 12.26M and not_a single acquisition or award in that window . The CFO alone handled 25 % of the total value and one of her sales was more than 3 % times her usual size . It could be perfect timing it could be strategic or it could just be routine for management . But the pattern stands out and I can ’ t ignore it . Analysts don ’ t seem worried at all . Most targets range from $ 220 to $ 320 while the stock trades around $ 185.55 . Cantor Fitzgerald sits at $ 300 with a high accuracy record Bernstein at $ 275 and Melius goes all the way to $ 320 .

      "selftext": "Anyone else feel like we’re walking into a weird Fed meeting this time? Everyone keeps calling it a “hawkish cut” setup which honestly sounds like an oxymoron but New York banks are basically telegraphing the same thing: “Yes, we’ll cut… but don’t get excited.” And that’s exactly the kind of messaging that usually whips the market in both directions before we get any real clarity. Here’s what’s messing with my head right now: Inflation is cooling, but not in a way that gives Powell the victory lap he wants. Labor data looks soft enough for a cut, but not soft enough for a full pivot. The bond market is acting like cuts are already guaranteed, while equities are pretending they’ve already spent the money. If we do get a hawkish cut, I’m honestly not sure which side reacts harder tech has been running on fumes, defensives are asleep, and small caps are out here fighting for their lives. My gut? Powell cuts 25bps, sounds like a disappointed dad, and the first move is the wrong move. Every FOMC lately has been a fade the initial-reaction trade. What I’m watching: Whether Powell mentions “financial conditions” tightening big clue. How the dot plot shifts for 2025 (this will decide who bleeds). If he pushes back on “multiple cuts” expectations that’s where the fireworks start. I’ve traded through a lot of these, but something about this one feels like the market is too sure of the outcome. Whenever that happens, the Fed usually smacks someone. Curious what’s everyone positioning into this? Are you hedging? Sitting in cash? Leaning into the volatility? Or just grabbing popcorn and letting algos fight it out?",

I find it especially intriguing that this company completely defied the inflation /tech meltdown of 2022. One of the very few stocks that closed positive for this year. Not only positive but 20% gains. Also this year in March the stock was largely unimpressed in anticipation of the liberation day. Spy was already down 8% while AZO reached new ATHs. It’s a low beta stock so I imagine it can work as a good hedge against a possible burst of the AI bubble. What do you think?",

I find it especially intriguing that this company completely defied the inflation tech meltdown of 2022 . One of the very few stocks that closed positive for this year . Not_only positive but 20 % gains . Also this year in March the stock was largely unimpressed in anticipation of the liberation day . Spy was already down 8 % while AZO reached new ATHs . It ’ s a low beta stock so I imagine it can work as a good hedge against a possible burst of the AI bubble . What do you think"

      "selftext": "Bitwise has updated its 10 Crypto Index ETF (BITW) to include four additional assets: Cardano, Avalanche, Sui and Polkadot. The fund now holds Bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana, Chainlink, Litecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Sui and Polkadot. According to Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, this makes BITW the first ETF from a major crypto asset manager to include these newer networks alongside the large-cap names. The move slightly broadens exposure beyond just the biggest and most established assets, though the fund is still heavily weighted toward Bitcoin and ether. It’ll be interesting to see whether this diversification actually improves long-term risk-adjusted returns, or if it just adds more volatility to an already volatile product. Source:",

The fund now holds Bitcoin ether XRP Solana Chainlink Litecoin Cardano Avalanche Sui and Polkadot . According to Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley this makes BITW the first ETF from a major crypto asset manager to include these newer networks alongside the largecap names . The move slightly broadens exposure beyond just the biggest and most established assets though the fund is still heavily weighted toward Bitcoin and ether .

      "selftext": "Hey, so if you don't know, I post more a lot in the daily threads over at r/stocks. I do like to write from time to time and have written a few posts in the past. One was around what I have learned along the years of investing, with like how I screen and how I research things. My approach is kind of a blend of Lynch and Buffet, where I'm a GARPy style investor. I don't mind paying fair price for something, like Buffet would say \"**It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price\".** So when I screen, I like to look for companies with a PEG under 2 and have high ROIC with growing revenues. More than happy to share my screener as well. I think a big part of becoming a successful investor is having to research. I actually enjoy doing this, since this can basically be a free hobby. You get to learn more about the world around you, plus just different industries. I also feel like this is one area you can do well, is finding some under the radar names that have little no analyst coverage. Below are some stocks I just find interesting, Doesn't mean you should go out and buy these names, but rather just highlighting some companies you probably have never heard of and just to bring up for the sake of discussion. So here are those companies: **BK Technologies Corp** [ Smaller company, but fundamentals are pretty solid. I have a thing for small float companies with good or high insider ownership. This company fits that, with only 2.97M shares available on the float with 13% insider ownership. Also has like no debt. Really strong numbers the last 4 quarters with revenue growth not being that great, but with gross margins and operating margins really improving as well as ROIC is looking really strong. [ Basically the company makes two way land mobile radios. They basically sell to all the federal agencies and have strong connections with them. Part of the story is the company outsourcing manufacturing which has led them to have less inventory, better margins and improved their working capital. Latest investor presentation: [ **Synchrony Financial** [ Much larger market cap here, with this one being 28B. Overall, it's a pretty cheap valuation for the company with the forward and trailing PE both at 8, with a PEG at 0.56. This company basically does financing and branded credit cards for retailers, making them more of a niche play. This one is a basically really boring compounder that has the risks of all credit names, but just offers a really cheap valuation. Latest quarter presentation: [ **Brainsway Ltd - ADR** This one is way more speculative of a name and not cheap, but the PEG is still about 1.04, since the EPS growth has been great. [ ROIC is a bit lower, but the company is what new to being profitable, but still seeing double digits revenue growth since Sep 2023. It has been a bit more normalized the past four quarters, around 27% growth QoQ. Another name is little debt, around 6.75M, but has 70M in cash & cash equivalents. Overall, I just find this company really interesting, what they do almost sounds fake. It offers Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation platform technology for the treatment of major depressive disorders, anxious depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, smoking addiction, bipolar disorders, post traumatic stress disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, post stroke rehabilitation, and Parkinson’s diseases. This is all FDA approved as well. Their latest investor presentation: [ **Flotek Industries Inc** Just opened a position in them this morning. They've been on my screener for a bit, but never looked into them. I tend to stay away from oil & gas names, really just own like one name in the space, FTI (which is another fun company) Valuation isn't too bad by any means: [ What is wild about this company, is the explosive growth they are seeing because they are basically going all into their data analytics side of things. Kind's of wild how much this has changed up the companies growth. Gross margins went from like 18.3% in Sep 2024 to 31.7% Sept 2025. Same thing happened with operating margins, going from 5.5% to 16.5% that same time period. ROIC is also looking great and the EPS growth is really impressive. [",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey so if you dont know I post more a lot in the daily threads over at rstocks . I do like to write from time to time and have written a few posts in the past . One was around what I have learned along the years of investing with like how I screen and how I research things . My approach is kind of a blend of Lynch and Buffet where Im a GARPy style investor . I dont mind paying fair price for something like Buffet would say Its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price . So when I screen I like to look for companies with a PEG under 2 and have high ROIC with growing revenues . More than happy to share my screener as well . I think a big part of becoming a successful investor is having to research . I actually enjoy doing this since this can basically be a free hobby . You get to learn more about the world around you plus just different industries . I also feel like this is one area you can do well is finding some under the radar names that have little no_analyst coverage . Below are some stocks I just find interesting Doesnt mean you should go out and buy these names but rather just highlighting some companies you probably have never_heard of and just to bring up for the sake of discussion . So here are those companies BK Technologies Corp Smaller company but fundamentals are pretty solid . I have a thing for small float companies with good or high insider ownership . This company fits that with only 2.97M shares available on the float with 13 % insider ownership . Also has like no_debt . Really strong numbers the last 4 quarters with revenue growth not_being that great but with gross margins and operating margins really improving as well as ROIC is looking really strong . Basically the company makes two way land mobile radios . They basically sell to all the federal agencies and have strong connections with them . Part of the story is the company outsourcing manufacturing which has led them to have less inventory better margins and improved their working capital . Latest investor presentation Synchrony Financial Much larger market cap here with this one being 28B . Overall its a pretty cheap valuation for the company with the forward and trailing PE both at 8 with a PEG at 0.56 . This company basically does financing and branded credit cards for retailers making them more of a niche play . This one is a basically really boring compounder that has the risks of all credit names but just offers a really cheap valuation . Latest quarter presentation Brainsway Ltd ADR This one is way more speculative of a name and not_cheap but the PEG is still about 1.04 since the EPS growth has been great . ROIC is a bit lower but the company is what new to being profitable but still seeing double digits revenue growth since Sep 2023 . It has been a bit more normalized the past four quarters around 27 % growth QoQ . Another name is little debt around 6.75M but has 70M in cash cash equivalents . Overall I just find this company really interesting what they do almost sounds fake . It offers Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation platform technology for the treatment of major depressive disorders anxious depression obsessivecompulsive disorders smoking addiction bipolar disorders post traumatic stress disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer ’ s disease autism chronic pain multiple sclerosis post stroke rehabilitation and Parkinson ’ s diseases . This is all FDA approved as well . Their latest investor presentation Flotek Industries Inc Just opened a position in them this morning . Theyve been on my screener for a bit but never_looked into them . I tend to stay away from oil gas names really just own like one name in the space FTI which is another fun company Valuation isnt too bad by any means What is wild about this company is the explosive growth they are seeing because they are basically going all into their data analytics side of things . Kinds of wild how much this has changed up the companies growth . Gross margins went from like 18.3 % in Sep 2024 to 31.7 % Sept 2025 . Same thing happened with operating margins going from 5.5 % to 16.5 % that same time period . ROIC is also looking great and the EPS growth is really impressive ."

And before you say “what kid would want a stock” i also get them toys and such so that im not the worst uncle ever. The first year was Disney and i explained what a stock is, the second year was Coca Cola and i explained what a dividend is. This year, im unsure what stock to get for them and what lesson to teach so im reaching out for suggestions! Obviously would love to gift them something like aapl or amzn but its a bit out of my price range at the moment, especially because i need to buy two! Im looking for a low risk, long term hold stock between $100-$150, so far PG is in the lead but im always willing to look into others. Additionally, and more importantly, what lesson should i try to teach them? And what would be a good child like analogy i can use to really drive it home? Any advice is appreciated!",

And before you say “ what kid would want a stock ” i also get them toys and such so that im not_the worst uncle ever . The first year was Disney and i explained what a stock is the second year was Coca Cola and i explained what a dividend is . This year im unsure what stock to get for them and what lesson to teach so im reaching out for suggestions Obviously would love to gift them something like aapl or amzn but its a bit out of my price range at the moment especially because i need to buy two Im looking for a low risk long term hold stock between $ 100 $ 150 so far PG is in the lead but im always willing to look into others . Additionally and more importantly what lesson should i try to teach them And what would be a good child like analogy i can use to really drive it home Any advice is appreciated"

NVDA ： Fresh positive news allowing H200 exports to China provides a clear near term catalyst, with sentiment likely to carry through year end. XOM ： If markets continue betting on rate cut expectations and winter demand recovery, oil prices remain supported. The energy sector often delivers strong year end performance during capital rotation. Recent oil price and energy consumption news are driving gains.

Thinking of either: (a) 60% VOO, 20% QQQM, 20% VXUS or (b) 45% VOO, 35% QQQM, 20% VXUS. After considering the various factors, my reasons for these 3 ETFs are as follows: - VOO as the backbone with the S&P 500. Although it’s the default “VOO and chill” which is a little boring, it’s relatively reliable and stable as a compounder and captures the overall strength of the US economy. - QQQM as the turbocharger for growth. Yes, VOO already has tech, but I see QQQM as a deliberate overweight into the sector which beats the broad market over the long run. I’m still on the boat that the tech sector will continue to thrive exponentially. - VXUS to capture everything non-US related. Europe, Japan, emerging markets, developed Asia. When the dollar weakens, when US valuations get too hot, when global cycles differ, VXUS is my ballast and the global hedge so I can ensure that I’m not betting my entire future on just one country.",

      "selftext": "Honestly, I’m getting tired of looking for value in this market with everything at ATH, so I started digging into unloved sectors. Stumbled across NICE Ltd ($NICE) and the numbers are weirdly good for a stock that’s done nothing lately. Basically, they do the backend software for contact centers (CCaaS) and financial crime prevention. Not sexy, I know. But here is the thing – they are quietly pivoting to cloud and actually making money. Their cloud revenue is growing fast and is about to flip their legacy business. Usually, when legacy tech companies pull off a cloud transition, the multiple expands, but NICE is still trading at a massive discount to pure-play cloud stocks like Salesforce or ServiceNow. I pulled the key numbers that stood out to me from their latest filings: |Metric|The Numbers|Why I think it matters| |:-|:-|:-| |**Cloud Growth**|**\\~20-22% (Guidance)**|Finally offsetting the legacy churn| |**FinCrime Margin**|**60-62%**|High-margin \"floor\" that funds the AI transition| |**Cash on Hand**|**\\~$1.5B**|Huge safety net, no bankruptcy risk here| |**Valuation**|**Discounted**|Priced like hardware, growing like SaaS| I looked deeper at their \"Actimize\" segment (the high-margin anti-money laundering stuff), and that 60%+ margin feels like a sticky floor because banks can’t just stop spending on compliance without getting fined by regulators. The bear case is obviously Amazon. Amazon Connect is eating market share and if AWS decides to burn cash to kill competitors, NICE could get squeezed. Also, they just bought Cognigy to catch up on the AI agent trend, and integration is always a coin toss. I’m thinking of opening a position because it feels like a classic GARP play that the market is ignoring because it’s \"boring\" compared to AI chips. Does anyone here have experience with their actual product? Is the moat against Amazon real or are they going to get crushed?",

Stumbled across NICE Ltd $ NICE and the numbers are weirdly good for a stock that ’ s done nothing_lately . Basically they do the backend software for contact centers CCaaS and financial crime prevention . Not_sexy I know . But here is the thing – they are quietly pivoting to cloud and actually making money . Their cloud revenue is growing fast and is about to flip their legacy business . Usually when legacy tech companies pull off a cloud transition the multiple expands but NICE is still trading at a massive discount to pureplay cloud stocks like Salesforce or ServiceNow . I pulled the key numbers that stood out to me from their latest filings MetricThe NumbersWhy I think it matters Cloud Growth2022 % GuidanceFinally offsetting the legacy churn FinCrime Margin6062 % Highmargin floor that funds the AI transition Cash on Hand $ 1.5BHuge safety net no_bankruptcy risk here ValuationDiscountedPriced like hardware growing like SaaS I looked deeper at their Actimize segment the highmargin antimoney laundering stuff and that 60 % margin feels like a sticky floor because banks can ’ t just stop spending on compliance without getting fined by regulators . The bear case is obviously Amazon . Amazon Connect is eating market share and if AWS decides to burn cash to kill competitors NICE could get squeezed . Also they just bought Cognigy to catch up on the AI agent trend and integration is always a coin toss . I ’ m thinking of opening a position because it feels like a classic GARP play that the market is ignoring because it ’ s boring compared to AI chips . Does anyone here have experience with their actual product Is the moat against Amazon real or are they going to get crushed"

The decision partially rolls back restrictions that had previously barred shipments of Nvidia’s A100, H100, and H200-class GPUs to Chinese customers over national security concerns. Under the revised rules, Nvidia may resume sales of the H200 so long as exported configurations fall within newly defined performance limits and comply with enhanced government monitoring. The adjustment follows weeks of uncertainty, during which Nvidia executives repeatedly emphasized that final export approval would ultimately come from President Trump. China represents 20 to 25% of Nvidia’s data-center revenue. Restoring access even partially could meaningfully lift 2026 sales guidance.",

      "title": "Netflix vs Paramount Skydance: The $108B Battle for HBO, Harry Potter, and DC - Who Wins?",
      "selftext": "Okay so this is getting spicy. We officially have a bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery and I genuinely don't know who wins here. Want to hear what you all think. # Quick background **Friday (Dec 5):** [Netflix announced a deal to buy WBD's studio and streaming assets]( for $72B ($27.75/share). This gets them HBO Max, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC Universe, The Sopranos, etc. Basically [100 years of Warner Bros content]( \\- 6,650 films, 50,000 TV titles. **Monday (Dec 8):** [Paramount Skydance launches hostile bid]( at $30/share all-cash ($108.4B enterprise value). David Ellison going directly to shareholders, bypassing the WBD board. The premium Paramount is offering? **$17.6 billion more** than Netflix's deal. # The money behind each bid **Netflix ($72B):** * Cash + stock deal * $5.8B breakup fee if regulators block it * Would combine #1 streamer (Netflix) with #3 (HBO Max) **Paramount Skydance ($108.4B):** * All cash, $30/share * Backed by [$40.7B from Larry Ellison]( (David's dad, Oracle co-founder) * Plus funding from Saudi, Qatar, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds * And Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners * [Bank of America, Citi, Apollo committed $54B in debt]( # The bull case for Netflix winning 1. **Synergies are insane.** They have [200M non-HBO Max subscribers globally]( who could be cross-sold HBO content. Revenue synergy is real. 2. **Bank of America literally said \"the throne is secured\"** on Dec 7. They see Netflix as the streaming endgame. 3. **They already have a signed deal.** WBD board approved it. Paramount has to convince shareholders to reject a bird in hand. 4. **Content integration is cleaner.** Netflix knows streaming. Paramount is still figuring out Paramount+ after the Skydance merger in August. # The bull case for Paramount winning 1. **$17.6 billion more cash.** Money talks. Shareholders might prefer certainty of all-cash vs Netflix's stock component. 2. **The Trump card (literally).** [Ellison told CNBC]( that Trump \"believes in competition\" and combining Paramount + WBD creates \"a real competitor to Netflix, a real competitor to Amazon.\" And here's what nobody's talking about: [Larry Ellison (David's dad) is basically Trump's closest tech ally]( He hosted a six-figure-per-person Trump fundraiser in 2020, [dines with Trump at Mar-a-Lago regularly]( and [dropped $450M on real estate 20 minutes from Mar-a-Lago]( When asked about TikTok, Trump literally said [\"I'd love for Larry to do it.\"]( Oracle got the Stargate AI deal. Some analysts say [Larry is more influential with Trump than Elon]( If this WBD deal needs regulatory approval from the Trump admin... who do you think has the edge? 3. **Antitrust concerns for Netflix are real.** Combining #1 and #3 streamers? [Elizabeth Warren already called it \"an anti-monopoly nightmare.\"]( Writers Guild wants it blocked. 4. **Paramount wants the WHOLE thing.** Netflix is only buying studios + streaming. [Paramount bid for the entire company]( including CNN, TNT Sports, etc. # What the market is saying * [WBD up 5% to $27]( (above Netflix's $27.75 offer, betting on bidding war) * PSKY up 7% * NFLX down 3% Market seems to think either Netflix raises or Paramount wins. # The regulatory wildcard Netflix agreed to pay [$5.8B breakup fee if blocked]( That's how real the antitrust risk is. If WBD chooses Paramount instead, they owe Netflix a $2.8B breakup fee. Not nothing. Ellison's argument: Paramount is smaller, less antitrust concern, faster close. Counter-argument: Paramount just closed the Skydance merger in August. Adding WBD on top? That's a LOT of integration. # My take (worth nothing) I genuinely don't know. The Netflix deal makes strategic sense - they get Harry Potter, DC, HBO originals, and crush the streaming wars permanently. But $17.6B is $17.6B and shareholders might want the cash. The Trump/Ellison relationship is the X factor nobody's pricing correctly imo. # Vote time - who wins? 1. **Netflix** \\- board-approved deal holds, synergies too good, Paramount's bid is desperate 2. **Paramount Skydance** \\- cash is king, regulatory path clearer, Trump admin approves faster 3. **Netflix raises bid** \\- this becomes a $90B+ deal 4. **Neither** \\- regulators block everything and WBD stays independent Drop your vote and reasoning. Especially curious what the media/entertainment folks here think about the content library value. *no position in any of these names, just fascinated by the biggest media deal since... ever?*",

      "selftext_processed": "Okay so this is getting spicy . We officially have a bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery and I genuinely dont know who wins here . Want to hear what you all think . Quick background Friday Dec 5 Netflix announced a deal to buy WBDs studio and streaming assets for $ 72B $ 27.75share . This gets them HBO Max Harry Potter Game of Thrones DC Universe The Sopranos etc . Basically 100 years of Warner Bros content 6650 films 50000 TV titles . Monday Dec 8 Paramount Skydance launches hostile bid at $ 30share allcash $ 108.4B enterprise value . David Ellison going directly to shareholders bypassing the WBD board . The premium Paramount is offering $ 17.6 billion more than Netflixs deal . The money behind each bid Netflix $ 72B Cash stock deal $ 5.8B breakup fee if regulators block it Would combine 1 streamer Netflix with 3 HBO Max Paramount Skydance $ 108.4B All cash $ 30share Backed by $ 40.7B from Larry Ellison Davids dad Oracle cofounder Plus funding from Saudi Qatar Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds And Jared Kushners Affinity Partners Bank of America Citi Apollo committed $ 54B in debt The bull case for Netflix winning 1 . Synergies are insane . They have 200M nonHBO Max subscribers globally who could be crosssold HBO content . Revenue synergy is real . 2 . Bank of America literally said the throne is secured on Dec 7 . They see Netflix as the streaming endgame . 3 . They already have a signed deal . WBD board approved it . Paramount has to convince shareholders to reject a bird in hand . 4 . Content integration is cleaner . Netflix knows streaming . Paramount is still figuring out Paramount after the Skydance merger in August . The bull case for Paramount winning 1 . $ 17.6 billion more cash . Money talks . Shareholders might prefer certainty of allcash vs Netflixs stock component . 2 . The Trump card literally . Ellison told CNBC that Trump believes in competition and combining Paramount WBD creates a real competitor to Netflix a real competitor to Amazon . And heres what nobodys_talking about Larry Ellison Davids dad is basically Trumps closest tech ally He hosted a sixfigureperperson Trump fundraiser in 2020 dines with Trump at MaraLago regularly and dropped $ 450M on real estate 20 minutes from MaraLago When asked about TikTok Trump literally said Id love for Larry to do it . Oracle got the Stargate AI deal . Some analysts say Larry is more influential with Trump than Elon If this WBD deal needs regulatory approval from the Trump admin ... who do you think has the edge 3 . Antitrust concerns for Netflix are real . Combining 1 and 3 streamers Elizabeth Warren already called it an antimonopoly nightmare . Writers Guild wants it blocked . 4 . Paramount wants the WHOLE thing . Netflix is only buying studios streaming . Paramount bid for the entire company including CNN TNT Sports etc . What the market is saying WBD up 5 % to $ 27 above Netflixs $ 27.75 offer betting on bidding war PSKY up 7 % NFLX down 3 % Market seems to think either Netflix raises or Paramount wins . The regulatory wildcard Netflix agreed to pay $ 5.8B breakup fee if blocked Thats how real the antitrust risk is . If WBD chooses Paramount instead they owe Netflix a $ 2.8B breakup fee . Not_nothing . Ellisons argument Paramount is smaller less antitrust concern faster close . Counterargument Paramount just closed the Skydance merger in August . Adding WBD on top Thats a LOT of integration . My take worth nothing_I genuinely dont know . The Netflix deal makes strategic sense they get Harry Potter DC HBO originals and crush the streaming wars permanently . But $ 17.6B is $ 17.6B and shareholders might want the cash . The TrumpEllison relationship is the X factor nobodys_pricing correctly imo . Vote time who wins 1 . Netflix boardapproved deal holds synergies too good Paramounts bid is desperate 2 . Paramount Skydance cash is king regulatory path clearer Trump admin approves faster 3 . Netflix raises bid this becomes a $ 90B deal 4 . Neither regulators block everything and WBD stays independent Drop your vote and reasoning . Especially curious what the mediaentertainment folks here think about the content library value . no position in any of these names just fascinated by the biggest media deal since ... ever"

I am looking to refill my emergency fund like if I were to lose my full time job and to prepare for that scenario beforehand, my initial plan right now is to put ~ $1500-$2000 in my high yield savings every month.

      "selftext": "# TL;DR Here’s the whole thesis: If you believe space launches will increase; if you expect NASA, commercial satellite operators, national-security agencies, and private launch companies will keep expanding activity into orbit, then Karman is a little-known company you *need* to know. ================================= # The Short & Sweet Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is a little-known **aerospace and defense** company posting numbers that look nothing like the obscurity of its stock. Revenue up 23% YoY, net income up 191%, and a funded backlog up 35%, with guidance calling for another year *(and beyond)* of **double-digit expansion**. For a company most of you haven’t even heard of, these are eye-popping metrics. The driver is straightforward: Karman builds high-spec structures, subsystems, and assemblies for **missiles, hypersonics, and next-gen launch vehicles**. Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–high-temperature alloys, for materials used in **strategic missile programs** where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive. That move pushed Karman deeper into **classified supply chains** tied to U.S. rearmament, allied purchases, and the global shift toward tactical missile systems. Karman also sits inside both of the next-decade launch platforms: **Blue Origin’s New Glenn and ULA’s Vulcan**. Each is designed for national security, deep-space, and commercial missions. And since Karman supplies structural components to *both* vehicles, you don’t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst. **Karman wins either way**. Karman’s core markets (missile defense, hypersonics, and launch systems) are expanding, not contracting. That makes its recent pullback attractive. **Takeaway:** Karman is a rare case of a true hidden gem. The company sits inside every major missile and launch trend, and that trend will just accelerate. ================================= # The Long & Winding Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is an under-the-radar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. **space and missile-defense programs**. But before we talk about what this company actually *does*, we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings. After all, **numbers don’t care about narratives**. They don’t hype. They simply record the truth, especially the kind most people don't pay attention to. Karman’s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual. A company whose trajectory doesn’t match its obscurity. **Growth hiding behind small-cap camouflage**. # The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small, the numbers don’t lie. They signal momentum. And momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental. # FY2024: A Record Across the Board On April 8, 2025, KRMN reported: * **Revenue**: $345.3M, **+23% YoY** * **Net income**: $12.7M, **+191.3% YoY** * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $106.1M, **+29.7% YoY** * **Funded backlog**: $579.8M, **+35.2% YoY** For a small-cap contractor, these are not ordinary numbers. This is a company stepping into a larger orbit. # 2025 Outlook: Expansion, Not Consolidation For FY2025, Karman expects: * **Revenue**: $423–$433M * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $132–$137M **Double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth**. # Q1 2025: The Trend Continued On May 13, 2025: * **EPS**: $0.05 (vs. $0.02 est.) * **Revenue**: $100.12M, **+20.6% YoY** Guidance reaffirmed. No slowdown. At this point, some of you might realize that even though you’ve never heard of this company, these numbers look interesting. And they are. Because once you peel back the veil, the reason becomes obvious. # The CEO Speaks After delivering the [Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025]( Tony Koblinski, Karman’s Chief Executive Officer, summarized it this way: >“Across numerous key metrics, we achieved record performance in 2024 that positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond. >Each of our end markets delivered **double-digit topline growth** and remains **very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and national priorities** in missiles, tactical defense systems, and space and launch systems.” [Karman Space & Defense Full-Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results]( Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside **America’s missile defense buildup, hypersonic development race, and next-generation launch ecosystem**. But to understand how deep that goes, we begin with a move that opened new doors. # The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year, Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. (MTI), a company specializing in **ultra-high-temperature refractory alloys** used in strategic missile systems. MTI works with materials such as Tantalum, Zirconium, Niobium, Vanadium, and Molybdenum. These aren’t ordinary metals. They are **engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys**. With this acquisition, Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities, access to high-specification missile programs, **deeper integration into classified supply chains**, increased revenue and EBITDA, and expanded design and manufacturing scope. KRMN reaffirmed that it is not just a supplier, but a *strategic* supplier. # Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles. Why? Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished, global conflicts have continued to drive demand, allies are purchasing next-generation tactical systems, and missile defense is entering a new strategic era. Karman provides the structures, subsystems, and assemblies that make these systems operational. Now, it’s not about whether there’s a war or not. Of course, I don’t want *any* wars. But even in peacetime, **missile defense isn’t slowing down**. It’s accelerating. And now Karman sits closer to the core. # Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highest-temperature, highest-priority arms race on Earth. **Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade**. Every major power is investing, testing, and racing toward Mach-5+ platforms. But **few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses**. Karman is one of them. This segment’s revenue surged thanks to well-funded programs in both development and production, **backed by aggressive government budgets**. Karman’s offerings (propulsion, deployable shrouds, launchers, energetic subsystems) are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems. This is not speculative work. This is strategic infrastructure. # Space and Launch Systems This is **where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge**. Revenue here increased due to Karman’s involvement in two next-generation launch vehicles. # Blue Origin’s New Glenn A heavy-lift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites, space infrastructure, and future deep-space missions. It is still in a development stage. Although, on November 13, 2025, the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time. The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027. Blue Origin’s customer base: * Commercial satellite operators. * Government payloads. * Potential national-security missions. [New Glenn]( is designed to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy. Its reusable first stage, massive payload capacity, and **long-term contract potential with DoD and NASA** make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem. Karman supplies components used in New Glenn’s structures and launch systems. # ULA’s Vulcan A next-generation launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). [Vulcan]( is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV, the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. national-security launches. It has already flown its first successful mission. This rocket is built to serve: * U.S. Space Force. * DoD national-security missions. * Commercial payloads. * NASA deep-space missions. Vulcan is engineered specifically for **National Security Space Launch (NSSL)** contracts: The elite, highest-priority, and highest-specification launches in America’s defense architecture and orbital missions. It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defense-related payloads over the next decade. And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan’s architecture. # Whichever Rocket Wins, Karman Wins This isn’t about picking sides in the rocket race. It isn’t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads, or which timeline slips, or which program accelerates. Karman supplies critical hardware to *both* ULA’s Vulcan and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. Karman’s components run through the veins of *both* launch systems. Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts, Karman wins with it. If national-security payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another, the outcome is the same: **Karman benefits either way**. # Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play. **If you understand this one idea**, the rest of the thesis can open itself to you. **You don’t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade**. You don’t have to choose heads or tails. Because with Karman, **it isn’t about the side of the coin**. **It’s just about the coin being flipped into the air**. **As long as rockets are being launched** (commercial, government, national-security, deep-space, doesn’t matter) **Karman benefits**. The rivalry is irrelevant. **The activity itself is the catalyst**. # The Short-Term Decline Now, yes, Karman, like many other growth names, was bruised over the past few weeks. The stock is down –24.80% since the close on November 3, 2025. Personally, I bought (and keep buying) the dip *gradually*. There was support in the high $50s (Karman has bounced from there, though), and the stock did ride a +23.37% rally in four days (Nov 21-26), so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap. Check the chart. Once it runs, it runs north fast. You should also know the KRMN play, although great for swings, is mostly meant for the **long term**. This is a **structural story**, not a short-lived trade. I did buy a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** for cheap, though. Of course, this one is a cheap, low-risk, high-reward play if it works. Quite simply, the stock can move $10 in a couple of days, and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike, these become multi-baggers. But, again, the main play is for the long-term. # Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23, portfolio manager [Randy Gwirtzman]( of Baron Capital published a Barron’s article highlighting small-cap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential. He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward **companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions**. His focus, however, is on profitability, a key filter, especially when bond yields spike. Karman Holdings popped up on his list. And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could **benefit enormously** in the coming years: **Trump’s Golden Dome plans**. Now, everything in this post has been the backdrop, the scaffolding, the necessary foundation. In my next post, if this DD gets approved/noticed, I’ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself, what it is, why it matters, and why a small, overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly, along with several more developments from KRMN. Have a nice day.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Here ’ s the whole thesis If you believe space launches will increase if you expect NASA commercial satellite operators nationalsecurity agencies and private launch companies will keep expanding activity into orbit then Karman is a littleknown company you need to know . The Short Sweet Karman Holdings $ KRMN is a littleknown aerospace and defense company posting numbers that look nothing_like the obscurity of its stock . Revenue up 23 % YoY net income up 191 % and a funded backlog up 35 % with guidance calling for another year and beyond of doubledigit expansion . For a company most of you haven ’ t even heard of these are eyepopping metrics . The driver is straightforward Karman builds highspec structures subsystems and assemblies for missiles hypersonics and nextgen launch vehicles . Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–hightemperature alloys for materials used in strategic missile programs where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive . That move pushed Karman deeper into classified supply chains tied to U.S. rearmament allied purchases and the global shift toward tactical missile systems . Karman also sits inside both of the nextdecade launch platforms Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn and ULA ’ s Vulcan . Each is designed for national security deepspace and commercial missions . And since Karman supplies structural components to both vehicles you don ’ t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst . Karman wins either way . Karman ’ s core markets missile defense hypersonics and launch systems are expanding not_contracting . That makes its recent pullback attractive . Takeaway Karman is a rare case of a true hidden gem . The company sits inside every major missile and launch trend and that trend will just accelerate . The Long Winding Karman Holdings $ KRMN is an undertheradar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. space and missiledefense programs . But before we talk about what this company actually does we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings . After all numbers don ’ t care about narratives . They don ’ t hype . They simply record the truth especially the kind most people dont pay attention to . Karman ’ s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual . A company whose trajectory doesn ’ t match its obscurity . Growth hiding behind smallcap camouflage . The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small the numbers don ’ t lie . They signal momentum . And momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental . FY2024 A Record Across the Board On April 8 2025 KRMN reported Revenue $ 345.3M 23 % YoY Net income $ 12.7M 191.3 % YoY Adjusted EBITDA $ 106.1M 29.7 % YoY Funded backlog $ 579.8M 35.2 % YoY For a smallcap contractor these are not_ordinary numbers . This is a company stepping into a larger orbit . 2025 Outlook Expansion Not_Consolidation For FY2025 Karman expects Revenue $ 423– $ 433M Adjusted EBITDA $ 132– $ 137M Doubledigit growth on top of doubledigit growth . Q1 2025 The Trend Continued On May 13 2025 EPS $ 0.05 vs. $ 0.02 est . Revenue $ 100.12M 20.6 % YoY Guidance reaffirmed . No_slowdown . At this point some of you might realize that even though you ’ ve never_heard of this company these numbers look interesting . And they are . Because once you peel back the veil the reason becomes obvious . The CEO Speaks After delivering the Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025 Tony Koblinski Karman ’ s Chief Executive Officer summarized it this way “ Across numerous key metrics we achieved record performance in 2024 that positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond . Each of our end markets delivered doubledigit topline growth and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and national priorities in missiles tactical defense systems and space and launch systems. ” Karman Space Defense FullFiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside America ’ s missile defense buildup hypersonic development race and nextgeneration launch ecosystem . But to understand how deep that goes we begin with a move that opened new doors . The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. MTI a company specializing in ultrahightemperature refractory alloys used in strategic missile systems . MTI works with materials such as Tantalum Zirconium Niobium Vanadium and Molybdenum . These aren ’ t ordinary metals . They are engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys . With this acquisition Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities access to highspecification missile programs deeper integration into classified supply chains increased revenue and EBITDA and expanded design and manufacturing scope . KRMN reaffirmed that it is not_just a supplier but a strategic supplier . Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles . Why Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished global conflicts have continued to drive demand allies are purchasing nextgeneration tactical systems and missile defense is entering a new strategic era . Karman provides the structures subsystems and assemblies that make these systems operational . Now it ’ s not_about whether there ’ s a war or not_Of course I don ’ t want any wars . But even in peacetime missile defense isn ’ t slowing down . It ’ s accelerating . And now Karman sits closer to the core . Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highesttemperature highestpriority arms race on Earth . Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade . Every major power is investing testing and racing toward Mach5 platforms . But few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses . Karman is one of them . This segment ’ s revenue surged thanks to wellfunded programs in both development and production backed by aggressive government budgets . Karman ’ s offerings propulsion deployable shrouds launchers energetic subsystems are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems . This is not_speculative work . This is strategic infrastructure . Space and Launch Systems This is where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge . Revenue here increased due to Karman ’ s involvement in two nextgeneration launch vehicles . Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn A heavylift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites space infrastructure and future deepspace missions . It is still in a development stage . Although on November 13 2025 the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time . The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027 . Blue Origin ’ s customer base Commercial satellite operators . Government payloads . Potential nationalsecurity missions . New Glenn is designed to compete with SpaceX ’ s Falcon Heavy . Its reusable first stage massive payload capacity and longterm contract potential with DoD and NASA make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem . Karman supplies components used in New Glenn ’ s structures and launch systems . ULA ’ s Vulcan A nextgeneration launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance a joint venture between Boeing BA and Lockheed Martin LMT . Vulcan is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. nationalsecurity launches . It has already flown its first successful mission . This rocket is built to serve U.S. Space Force . DoD nationalsecurity missions . Commercial payloads . NASA deepspace missions . Vulcan is engineered specifically for National Security Space Launch NSSL contracts The elite highestpriority and highestspecification launches in America ’ s defense architecture and orbital missions . It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defenserelated payloads over the next decade . And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan ’ s architecture . Whichever Rocket Wins Karman Wins This isn ’ t about picking sides in the rocket race . It isn ’ t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads or which timeline slips or which program accelerates . Karman supplies critical hardware to both ULA ’ s Vulcan and Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn . Karman ’ s components run through the veins of both launch systems . Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts Karman wins with it . If nationalsecurity payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another the outcome is the same Karman benefits either way . Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play . If you understand this one idea the rest of the thesis can open itself to you . You don ’ t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade . You don ’ t have to choose heads or tails . Because with Karman it isn ’ t about the side of the coin . It ’ s just about the coin being flipped into the air . As long as rockets are being launched commercial government nationalsecurity deepspace doesn ’ t matter Karman benefits . The rivalry is irrelevant . The activity itself is the catalyst . The ShortTerm Decline Now yes Karman like many other growth names was bruised over the past few weeks . The stock is down –24.80 % since the close on November 3 2025 . Personally I bought and keep buying the dip gradually . There was support in the high $ 50s Karman has bounced from there though and the stock did ride a 23.37 % rally in four days Nov 2126 so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap . Check the chart . Once it runs it runs north fast . You should also know the KRMN play although great for swings is mostly meant for the long term . This is a structural story not_a shortlived trade . I did buy a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls for cheap though . Of course this one is a cheap lowrisk highreward play if it works . Quite simply the stock can move $ 10 in a couple of days and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike these become multibaggers . But again the main play is for the longterm . Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23 portfolio manager Randy Gwirtzman of Baron Capital published a Barron ’ s article highlighting smallcap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential . He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions . His focus however is on profitability a key filter especially when bond yields spike . Karman Holdings popped up on his list . And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could benefit enormously in the coming years Trump ’ s Golden Dome plans . Now everything in this post has been the backdrop the scaffolding the necessary foundation . In my next post if this DD gets approvednoticed I ’ ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself what it is why it matters and why a small overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly along with several more developments from KRMN . Have a nice day ."

      "selftext": "Seeking a compromise over controlling exports to China, the US Department of Commerce will soon allow the export of powerful Nvidia GPUs that are roughly 18 months behind its most advanced offerings, according to a person with knowledge of the plan. The move, which would send Nvidia H200s to China, seeks to find a middle ground between those who oppose exports of any advanced AI chips and those who worry that restrictions will merely hand the market to Chinese competitors. It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government, which has blocked imports of less powerful chips, such as Nvidia’s H20. The move, which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, could bolster Nvidia’s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide. The US enacted strict export restrictions under the Biden Administration in an effort to prevent China from catching up on AI. But some in the White House believe those restrictions have more or less failed, according to people familiar with their thinking. [Source](",

The move which would send Nvidia H200s to China seeks to find a middle ground between those who oppose exports of any advanced AI chips and those who worry that restrictions will merely hand the market to Chinese competitors . It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government which has blocked imports of less powerful chips such as Nvidia ’ s H20 . The move which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick could bolster Nvidia ’ s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide . The US enacted strict export restrictions under the Biden Administration in an effort to prevent China from catching up on AI . But some in the White House believe those restrictions have more or less failed according to people familiar with their thinking . Source"

      "selftext": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics ($MLTX) YOLO. I added on to my position here today. **I still like the stock.** TL;DR: MoonLake ($MLTX) is primed to be a chronic inflammatory disease (CID) powerhouse. We have an upcoming FDA Type B meeting on December 15, 2025. This is just the beginning. MoonLake has a shareholder friendly management team and a massive potential addressable market. We already have a robust dataset from various clinical trials on SLK efficacy across various indications in the CID landscape. DD is available here: [ We recently got a Phase 2 LEDA data readout just last month. PPP is an untapped market; there are no approved treatments for PPP in the US or EU and the company plans to move forward with a Phase 3 next year. [ Also, I don’t really like talking about personal details, but here is some context: My personal life is a mess. I’m living out of a hotel right now. My wife kicked me out of the house, removed my access from the Tesla app, and took our only car. [Telsa]( I currently have a rental car, and the internet here is horrible. I’m moving to another one later today; my morning is stacked with meetings. I need to physically move hotels, as well as secure various accounts. My soon-to-be ex-wife linked her new bank account to one of my Fidelity accounts last night. I set up UTMA accounts for my kids that each have about 100K in them currently, which I already don’t have access to trade. (Side note: If my soon-to-be ex-wife happens to read this: please take some free cash in there and invest it in MLTX for the children) [Sneaky Links?]( I say this for context; I believe I am finally seeing things more clearly than I have in a while, but there are distractions everywhere. I’ll try and answer any questions as they come up, but that may not be until later because my personal life is a mess, and I think everyone has a right to know what I’m going through for perspective. I said weeks ago here: That I fully expect MLTX to buy me a car, maybe a house: [Reddit r\\/InvestingandTrading]( I’m buying another car and likely another house. I fully expect MLTX stock to more than pay for it… But I’m not selling MLTX stock. Luckily, I have other trades like this I can free up capital with: [Silver 100&#37; YTD]( And anyone who knows me personally knows I like silver, even at these levels. With the long standing global fiscal deficits, the increasing global debt levels, the cost to service this debt is going to be increasingly monetization. Debasement has to accelerate here. This is bullish for real assets. Stock valuations are currently elevated. Does it make sense that stock valuations are this high? TINA. Increasingly, there is no alternative. Holders of debt-based currencies are going to increasingly lose purchasing power. That dynamic is outstandingly bullish for real assets comparatively. Silver is positioned as one of the most atractive metals right now with a tight supply and robust industrial demand, and a persistent supply deficit. We have already seen cracks in the silver market, and the world needs hard money now more than ever. That just goes to say, as much as I like silver, I like MLTX more. I don’t reduce my silver position lightly. MLTX is poised as the single greatest asymmetric setup I have seen in my investment career, and the catalysts are staggering: [MLTX Catalyst Pipeline]( I’ve said before I don’t like price targets, and I’ve said MLTX can 3X, 4X, or 5X by next year. Next year is only a few weeks away. MLTX is currently a 1 billion dollar company as I write this. The opportunity across the CID space is huge. A 10X from here only needs MLTX to hit roughly a 10 billion market capitalization. That equates to right around $140 a share. Long-term, MLTX appreciation can potentially rise much higher with the variety of CID indications SLK can possibly address. [Possible SLK Indications]( On top of this, MoonLake appears to have one of the best management teams I have seen. The company is quick, capital-efficient, and transparent. They should not need to dilute going forward; they have a cash runway well into 2027. They are not burdened by any massive debt. Additionally, they have a non-dilutive debt facility in place to provide additional funding well into potential commercialization. This is a management team that respects shareholders. This is a company that I want to be part of. Some context on options: Please be responsible here. MLTX is still a small cap stock. MLTX options are thinly traded with wide spreads and low liquidity. I can't recommend trading these unless you fully understand the risks you are taking. I have December 2025 calls because it was a very cost-effective way to gain leverage, and it’s a very small percentage of my overall allocation to MLTX. I am willing to lose the entire investment, and to make these pay off, I am pretty much relying on a positive statement from the company after the Dec 15 FDA meeting outlining a path forward for an SLK BLA for HS prior to expiration as the official minutes from the meeting I don’t expect to be released until well after the expiration date. I am not relying on the official FDA meeting minutes. I expect these things to happen, but the timing is tight. The timing risk is real, and if this catalyst misses the tight window of the Dec options expiration, they are worthless. If I had limited capital, I was willing to lose; that’s my lottery ticket. But if they pay off – I’m looking at a potential 100X or more on the invested capital on those options. Taking asymmetric payoff on an asymmetric stock is capital efficiency at its best. A path forward to SLK approval after the Dec 15 FDA Type B meeting could rerate MLTX violently higher. I also have some other short-dated calls I put on just to gain inexpensive leverage to potential MLTX appreciation; the bulk of my position is as a long-term MLTX shareholder. This is not financial advice. But please take this advice: don’t play the lottery if you don’t have the capital to lose, and do your due diligence first. Not just on MLTX, but any investment.

      "selftext_processed": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics $ MLTX YOLO . I added on to my position here today . I still like the stock . TLDR MoonLake $ MLTX is primed to be a chronic inflammatory disease CID powerhouse . We have an upcoming FDA Type B meeting on December 15 2025 . This is just the beginning . MoonLake has a shareholder friendly management team and a massive potential addressable market . We already have a robust dataset from various clinical trials on SLK efficacy across various indications in the CID landscape . DD is available here We recently got a Phase 2 LEDA data readout just last month . PPP is an untapped market there are no_approved treatments for PPP in the US or EU and the company plans to move forward with a Phase 3 next year . Also I don ’ t really like talking about personal details but here is some context My personal life is a mess . I ’ m living out of a hotel right now . My wife kicked me out of the house removed my access from the Tesla app and took our only car . Telsa I currently have a rental car and the internet here is horrible . I ’ m moving to another one later today my morning is stacked with meetings . I need to physically move hotels as well as secure various accounts . My soontobe exwife linked her new bank account to one of my Fidelity accounts last night . I set up UTMA accounts for my kids that each have about 100K in them currently which I already don ’ t have access to trade . Side note If my soontobe exwife happens to read this please take some free cash in there and invest it in MLTX for the children Sneaky Links I say this for context I believe I am finally seeing things more clearly than I have in a while but there are distractions everywhere . I ’ ll try and answer any questions as they come up but that may not_be until later because my personal life is a mess and I think everyone has a right to know what I ’ m going through for perspective . I said weeks ago here That I fully expect MLTX to buy me a car maybe a house Reddit rInvestingandTrading I ’ m buying another car and likely another house . I fully expect MLTX stock to more than pay for it… But I ’ m not_selling MLTX stock . Luckily I have other trades like this I can free up capital with Silver 10037 YTD And anyone who knows me personally knows I like silver even at these levels . With the long standing global fiscal deficits the increasing global debt levels the cost to service this debt is going to be increasingly monetization . Debasement has to accelerate here . This is bullish for real assets . Stock valuations are currently elevated . Does it make sense that stock valuations are this high TINA . Increasingly there is no_alternative . Holders of debtbased currencies are going to increasingly lose purchasing power . That dynamic is outstandingly bullish for real assets comparatively . Silver is positioned as one of the most atractive metals right now with a tight supply and robust industrial demand and a persistent supply deficit . We have already seen cracks in the silver market and the world needs hard money now more than ever . That just goes to say as much as I like silver I like MLTX more . I don ’ t reduce my silver position lightly . MLTX is poised as the single greatest asymmetric setup I have seen in my investment career and the catalysts are staggering MLTX Catalyst Pipeline I ’ ve said before I don ’ t like price targets and I ’ ve said MLTX can 3X 4X or 5X by next year . Next year is only a few weeks away . MLTX is currently a 1 billion dollar company as I write this . The opportunity across the CID space is huge . A 10X from here only needs MLTX to hit roughly a 10 billion market capitalization . That equates to right around $ 140 a share . Longterm MLTX appreciation can potentially rise much higher with the variety of CID indications SLK can possibly address . Possible SLK Indications On top of this MoonLake appears to have one of the best management teams I have seen . The company is quick capitalefficient and transparent . They should not_need to dilute going forward they have a cash runway well into 2027 . They are not_burdened by any massive debt . Additionally they have a nondilutive debt facility in place to provide additional funding well into potential commercialization . This is a management team that respects shareholders . This is a company that I want to be part of . Some context on options Please be responsible here . MLTX is still a small cap stock . MLTX options are thinly traded with wide spreads and low liquidity . I cant recommend trading these unless you fully understand the risks you are taking . I have December 2025 calls because it was a very costeffective way to gain leverage and it ’ s a very small percentage of my overall allocation to MLTX . I am willing to lose the entire investment and to make these pay off I am pretty much relying on a positive statement from the company after the Dec 15 FDA meeting outlining a path forward for an SLK BLA for HS prior to expiration as the official minutes from the meeting I don ’ t expect to be released until well after the expiration date . I am not_relying on the official FDA meeting minutes . I expect these things to happen but the timing is tight . The timing risk is real and if this catalyst misses the tight window of the Dec options expiration they are worthless . If I had limited capital I was willing to lose that ’ s my lottery ticket . But if they pay off – I ’ m looking at a potential 100X or more on the invested capital on those options . Taking asymmetric payoff on an asymmetric stock is capital efficiency at its best . A path forward to SLK approval after the Dec 15 FDA Type B meeting could rerate MLTX violently higher . I also have some other shortdated calls I put on just to gain inexpensive leverage to potential MLTX appreciation the bulk of my position is as a longterm MLTX shareholder . This is not_financial advice . But please take this advice don ’ t play the lottery if you don ’ t have the capital to lose and do your due diligence first . Not_just on MLTX but any investment . Misinformation is everywhere . Trade smart stay disciplined Richard Doxtator MBA CFA"

If you had to choose one individual stock for a long-term tech tilt, would you go with Meta or Microsoft? Microsoft seems strongly positioned in AI through Azure + OpenAI, while Meta has strong advertising growth and LLaMA, but is more volatile. Which one do you think offers the better long-term risk/reward profile? Thanks!",

      "selftext": "Not advice, just my own opinion. I want you to know this. The more data I look at and the more cycles I experience, I think the real advantage is not timing, predictions, or choosing the perfect asset. Just sticking with a simple system long enough and it won't matter. Markets will always experience terrible declines, phases of hype, strange macro shocks... It's not the strategy that destroys most people, it's the reaction. Every time someone abandons their plan in some parts, long-term calculations fall apart. For me, consistency has been the only thing that has really come out. It's not exciting, but it works.",

In April last year ⁠the company bought cloud firm HashiCorp in ​a deal valued at $ 6.4 billion . Its $ 34 billion ​deal for Red Hat in 2019 is credited by analysts as the central catalyst that boosted its cloud business . IBM will fund ‍the Confluent deal ⁠with cash on hand and the transaction is expected to close by the middle of 2026 .

A few years ago, it was everywhere, but now it seems that the standard advice is \"just ETFs, ignore the rest.\" I mostly follow this approach, but I still keep a small allocation to P2P for diversification. For me, P2P only works as: a small part of my portfolio something outside the public markets an experiment, not a core strategy I've been using one platform in the EU for some time (that's not the topic of this post, I don't want to promote anything here). The experience has been... okay. Nothing magical, nothing terrible – just another tool with its own risks and compromises. It is clear that: there is a platform risk buyback guarantees are not real guarantees it can go wrong, especially in unfavorable macroeconomic conditions This is not advice or a recommendation. I'm just interested in what the community thinks about it. So: are you still investing in P2P, or have you completely abandoned it in favor of ETFs/stocks?

The last time I did a single large deposit into the market was around 2022, and within a few months the market took a downturn and it was painful to see it take several years for that money to return to the original investment value so now I am scared. In addition to that experience, I feel like I keep hearing there will be an AI bubble burst and downturn in the market. What would you all recommend? Invest 1 million now all at once or slowly? Are there funds you recommend investing in to avoid this AI bubble burst?",

The last time I did a single large deposit into the market was around 2022 and within a few months the market took a downturn and it was painful to see it take several years for that money to return to the original investment value so now I am scared . In addition to that experience I feel like I keep hearing there will be an AI bubble burst and downturn in the market . What would you all recommend Invest 1 million now all at once or slowly Are there funds you recommend investing in to avoid this AI bubble burst"

      "selftext": "Remember when Bessent said a housing emergency may be declared? I think the government shutdown messed with the timing but now I think we have two catalysts that will make a declaration soon be smart from the White House: 1. Road to Housing Act - somehow a bipartisan bill from Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren. It passed the senate and is attached to the NDAA. Now the house needs to decide if it’s going to add it on their end. Road to Housing is huge and if it passes alone makes my trade good. Ask AI to explain it to you and what it does for housing stocks 2. FOMC meeting. With 2.5 days to go until a decision it would be dumb to introduce anything that could be construed as inflationary towards home prices. If the rate cut hits and Road to Housing passes, things are a lot easier for the executive to do their whole declare stuff that may or may not stick thing. I don’t fully think materials tariffs will be lowered but Bessent did talk about it. Now, there’s a wrinkle here. We don’t have enough construction workers. So from my POV we have two solutions: 1. Lift the cap on H2B workers - which may be done temporarily via executive order, particularly if a housing emergency is declared. 2. Road to Housing act incentivizes localities to relax zoning for manufactured houses. I think Road To Housing is the key element here. It provides a ton of benefits to manufactured housing, small houses, and cheaper housing. It couldn’t move forward without the government reopening. The government is open and we may get our rate cut. It passed the senate, and the White House wants the house to add it. I think this ends up being a path of political survival now that it’s clear affordability is what will be driving voters at midterms. Stocks I bought (see screenshots): Builders and materials: ITB QXO DHI LGIH Manufactured: CVCO SKY UMH ELS More People Buying and Moving: RKT Z COMP I think materials and most builders aren’t ideal for this because the workers shortage is a real bottleneck. Manufactured could be huge here, but DHI and LGIH sell a lot of starter homes. The RKT Z COMP stocks do best if rates fall and if the portable mortgages, 40/50 yr mortgage ideas get put in action. If Hassett replaces JP we’ll probably get the lower rates. Unrelated to all the policy and rate specific stuff, Cathie Wood oddly referenced housing as a good trade 2 days ago: I deleted my last DD on this because it was too heavy on materials and didn’t have the manufactured homes builders. I still want to get this up so I can feel good about having told everyone before it all goes off. Not financial advice.",

      "selftext_processed": "Remember when Bessent said a housing emergency may be declared I think the government shutdown messed with the timing but now I think we have two catalysts that will make a declaration soon be smart from the White House 1 . Road to Housing Act somehow a bipartisan bill from Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren . It passed the senate and is attached to the NDAA . Now the house needs to decide if it ’ s going to add it on their end . Road to Housing is huge and if it passes alone makes my trade good . Ask AI to explain it to you and what it does for housing stocks 2 . FOMC meeting . With 2.5 days to go until a decision it would be dumb to introduce anything that could be construed as inflationary towards home prices . If the rate cut hits and Road to Housing passes things are a lot easier for the executive to do their whole declare stuff that may or may not_stick thing . I don ’ t fully think materials tariffs will be lowered but Bessent did talk about it . Now there ’ s a wrinkle here . We don ’ t have enough construction workers . So from my POV we have two solutions 1 . Lift the cap on H2B workers which may be done temporarily via executive order particularly if a housing emergency is declared . 2 . Road to Housing act incentivizes localities to relax zoning for manufactured houses . I think Road To Housing is the key element here . It provides a ton of benefits to manufactured housing small houses and cheaper housing . It couldn ’ t move forward without the government reopening . The government is open and we may get our rate cut . It passed the senate and the White House wants the house to add it . I think this ends up being a path of political survival now that it ’ s clear affordability is what will be driving voters at midterms . Stocks I bought see screenshots Builders and materials ITB QXO DHI LGIH Manufactured CVCO SKY UMH ELS More People Buying and Moving RKT Z COMP I think materials and most builders aren ’ t ideal for this because the workers shortage is a real bottleneck . Manufactured could be huge here but DHI and LGIH sell a lot of starter homes . The RKT Z COMP stocks do best if rates fall and if the portable mortgages 4050 yr mortgage ideas get put in action . If Hassett replaces JP we ’ ll probably get the lower rates . Unrelated to all the policy and rate specific stuff Cathie Wood oddly referenced housing as a good trade 2 days ago I deleted my last DD on this because it was too heavy on materials and didn ’ t have the manufactured homes builders . I still want to get this up so I can feel good about having told everyone before it all goes off . Not_financial advice ."

      "selftext": "Hi all - I bought 160 shares of Palantir in late 2024 in a smaller account. I studied the company and watched the stock like crazy before I invested, but I should’ve bought more. Some were purchased at $31 and some were purchased at $43. I let my dad sometimes manage one of my accounts, a smaller, diversified portfolio, as he has done really well in the stock market. I’ve was pregnant this past year and not looking at my accounts as I didn’t want to make any rash decisions (pregnancy hormones). He asked me in May 2025 if I would think about selling some shares since I made a good profit and he thought palantir’s rapid growth was unsustainable. I told him he could sell 10 shares, but I’d really prefer him not to. In June 2025 I told him, I hope you didn’t sell any palantir, and he replied “you’re good.” I found out last week after I got back on my account for the first time that he sold 160 shares, 60 at $121.02 in May 2025 and 80 shares at $158.65 in August 2025. He didn’t tell me about this, and I didn’t see the emails or check my account so I didn’t find out until last week. Usually I manage my account weekly. Now I only have 20 shares left. In my dads defense, he has made me a lot of money on stocks, so while I am angry at him, he always tells me before he buys and sells and I do the bulk of the trading. My stock advisor only manages big funds and not individual stocks, so he doesn’t place any trades for me. I am wondering if I should buy back Palantir, at least 30 shares, as its growth is expected to continue to skyrocket. I know its trading at $181 but have no problem putting a couple thousand into it.",

      "selftext": "I posted this on Friday predicting SP inclusion, but the mods deleted it. Anyway… I’ve been studying/trading Carvana for many years. The key to survival has been understanding that the CVNA CEO and his father (who owns nearly 40% of the diluted share count an sits at #42 in the Forbes list) are evil, but extremely clever. They have manipulated both the share price as well as the company’s financials by controlling the float and establishing 4 quarters of profitability via related party transactions. Their end goal was always SP inclusion, which now creates continuous liquidity to turn back on the 10b5-1 trading plan and unload on passive buyers. Due to the conditions that enabled the above, this ain’t a gap up, it’s a supply crisis. Institutions currently own 90-95% of the tradeable float. The actual loose float available is only 10-15 million shares. Tomorrow morning three big buyers are hitting a wall of zero supply: - Short interest is still ~12M shares. Many are facing a margin call at the open and must buy to cover. - MM were selling calls all week on the rumor. With the AH gap to $440, thousands of Dec 19 contracts just went Deep ITM. MM need to buy 2.5M - 3M shares to stay delta neutral. - The SP500 index funds need to buy roughly 16 million shares (approx. $7B) by Dec 19. They can't buy yet, so arb desks will be buying Monday to warehousefor them. The level of greed is on mars right now because every trading desk is aware of the mechanics and liquidity crunch. Institutions are holding because they know indexes will pay whatever it takes on Dec 18. Buying demand far outweighs supply. It’s hard to say how exactly this plays out, but this is stock is crazy and this event is extremely unique. If I had to guess, CVNA gaps up 15%+ and has the potential to rip higher. I’m expecting a high in the 470-500 range. Absurd, I know, but this is the grand finale of one of the greatest marker manipulations in history. It’ll be fun to watch tomorrow.",

      "selftext": "Buying VOO and shorting a few stocks is not for me. As the Mag 7 combined are now ~ 35% of S&P500, VOO has become a less diversified investment. As a principle, I don’t like concentration. TSLA ’s valuation in particular is an outlier. Buying VOO and shorting TSLA (or any other) requires margin and the market could stay irrational longer than one can stay solvent. What if I just don’t own it? I found XMAG is an ETF with full replication of S&P493 ( it excludes the Mag 7). Fees are 0.35% so quite more than VOO 0.03% but lower than direct indexing, has no minimum and no headache of transferring assets to another brokerage. It rebalances quarterly. I see one drawback, it’s new and relatively small (67M in assets! ) The bid & ask spread yesterday was a few cents (17 bps). It’s pretty simple to add any of the Mag7 by adding individual stock(s).",

As a principle I don ’ t like concentration . TSLA ’ s valuation in particular is an outlier . Buying VOO and shorting TSLA or any other requires margin and the market could stay irrational longer than one can stay solvent . What if I just don ’ t own it I found XMAG is an ETF with full replication of SP493 it excludes the Mag 7 . Fees are 0.35 % so quite more than VOO 0.03 % but lower than direct indexing has no_minimum and no_headache of transferring assets to another brokerage . It rebalances quarterly . I see one drawback it ’ s new and relatively small 67M in assets The bid ask spread yesterday was a few cents 17 bps . It ’ s pretty simple to add any of the Mag7 by adding individual stocks ."

      "selftext": "My grandfather retired in 1998 at 48 years old(around when I was born to help out), he had about $75k in an IRA and a pension that covered most of his expenses. He currently has $170k in a Roth IRA. Since then he’s invested only in stocks (no bonds or ETFs), he mostly did short term trades until 5-7 years ago he started long term investing. The last 20 years he withdrew between $15-25k a year to help cover expenses. He’s always talked to me about investing and taught me maybe half of what I know. It helped set me on a really solid path, but I never actually knew how well he did and he never tracked it. But yesterday I finally grew the balls to ask to check his Fidelity account and look at what its performance tracker says, he’s old now and literally didn’t know it had that feature. So over the last 10 years he had annualized returns of 14.2%, the first couple years were a bit harder to gauge since he moved everything from a trad ira to a Roth IRA. But I got it down to 10.7% annualized over 27 years. I see sp500 over that time annualized 9.02%, but the nasdaq (which is his preferred benchmark) is 11-12% I couldn’t get an exact number easily. So he outperformed the sp500 but underperformed the nasdaq. I’d argue he did much better than he likely would have with an advisor (after fees) or even just following the normal 80/20 recommendation. So I think his performance is good. However, I don’t think it was great and likely when risk adjusted significantly underperformed. Curious what others think as everyone here always says “well good luck maintaining that for 30 years” and I never see realistic posts of people’s 30 year return so I figured I’d share a real life example.",

      "selftext_processed": "My grandfather retired in 1998 at 48 years oldaround when I was born to help out he had about $ 75k in an IRA and a pension that covered most of his expenses . He currently has $ 170k in a Roth IRA . Since then he ’ s invested only in stocks no bonds or ETFs he mostly did short term trades until 57 years ago he started long term investing . The last 20 years he withdrew between $ 1525k a year to help cover expenses . He ’ s always talked to me about investing and taught me maybe half of what I know . It helped set me on a really solid path but I never_actually knew how well he did and he never_tracked it . But yesterday I finally grew the balls to ask to check his Fidelity account and look at what its performance tracker says he ’ s old now and literally didn ’ t know it had that feature . So over the last 10 years he had annualized returns of 14.2 % the first couple years were a bit harder to gauge since he moved everything from a trad ira to a Roth IRA . But I got it down to 10.7 % annualized over 27 years . I see sp500 over that time annualized 9.02 % but the nasdaq which is his preferred benchmark is 1112 % I couldn ’ t get an exact number easily . So he outperformed the sp500 but underperformed the nasdaq . I ’ d argue he did much better than he likely would have with an advisor after fees or even just following the normal 8020 recommendation . So I think his performance is good . However I don ’ t think it was great and likely when risk adjusted significantly underperformed . Curious what others think as everyone here always says “ well good luck maintaining that for 30 years ” and I never_see realistic posts of people ’ s 30 year return so I figured I ’ d share a real life example ."

      "selftext": "With apologies to BCG's Growth Share Matrix, I present my version for evaluating public stocks. Using Zacks.com’s stock screener, I downloaded all public stocks with: (1) a market cap above $100 billion, (2) an operating margin above 0%, and (3) a sales growth forecast above 0%. This screen gave me 118 stocks (including the Class B shares for GOOG/L). I then put those stocks in a scatter plot to identify the Stars: [Growth Profit Matrix]( With no surprise, the semiconductor stocks NVDA and AVGO were the furthest into the Star region. PLTR, HOOD, LLY and TSM also made the cut. MA, APP and V are examples of high operating margin but lower revenue growth stocks. For my Value Points calculation, I like stocks that have a combined operating margin and projected revenue growth of at least 40 (above the blue line). This could include Stars, Cash Cows and Question Marks. Once I’ve identified the good companies, the next step, of course, is to determine whether they currently are overvalued, undervalued or appropriately priced. We will run that analysis on individual stocks over the coming weeks.",

      "selftext_processed": "With apologies to BCGs Growth Share Matrix I present my version for evaluating public stocks . Using Zacks.com ’ s stock screener I downloaded all public stocks with 1 a market cap above $ 100 billion 2 an operating margin above 0 % and 3 a sales growth forecast above 0 % . This screen gave me 118 stocks including the Class B shares for GOOGL . I then put those stocks in a scatter plot to identify the Stars Growth Profit Matrix With no_surprise the semiconductor stocks NVDA and AVGO were the furthest into the Star region . PLTR HOOD LLY and TSM also made the cut . MA APP and V are examples of high operating margin but lower revenue growth stocks . For my Value Points calculation I like stocks that have a combined operating margin and projected revenue growth of at least 40 above the blue line . This could include Stars Cash Cows and Question Marks . Once I ’ ve identified the good companies the next step of course is to determine whether they currently are overvalued undervalued or appropriately priced . We will run that analysis on individual stocks over the coming weeks ."

      "selftext": "I’m 23 years old. I’ve been in the workforce for 1 year after finishing my degree and I don’t have a good job or a career yet. I’ve recently inherited a little over $1,000,000 AUD. I know there are reasons Australians have to buy a house. The first is you don't have to pay capital gains tax when you sell your Principal Place of Residence (PPOR). The second is that it's the easiest way for a normal person to get access to affordable leverage. Finally, it's a great forced savings mechanism for people without the discipline to save. On the other hand, I feel like most Australian property investors are very emotional about their investments. They see the good performance over the last couple of decades and believe that that tells them anything about the future performance of the asset class. There's also the status associated with owning a home and FOMO about being priced out of owning a home that influences them to buy. Needless to say, emotional investments have rarely made for good investments historically. Stocks seem attractive to me because of the 50 percent CGT discount for long-term holders. If you sell it slowly in retirement you can avoid paying CGT just as with a PPOR. Furthermore, while price to rental yields make purchasing property expensive in Australia right now, stocks don't have this same issue. US stocks are expensive. The average PE ratio is extraordinarily high compared to the past. The current preference of Australian investors to overweight US stocks is probably in part due to the common fallacy of investors to look at past exceptional performance to extrapolate exceptional performance in the future. Emerging market stocks are not, however. The PE ratios are low, and sentiment around EM stocks is pessimistic. They have done poorly the past 2 decades, after all. Meanwhile developing countries particularly in Asia seem to be making progress modernising and see no signs of slowing down. People there are industrious, educated and intelligent while Westerners doing the same jobs are often complacent, entitled, and lazy. So what I'm saying here is that EM stocks, to my eye, are cheap and are a solid bet and that Australian property is overrated and expensive. Is there some argument for Australian property I'm not seeing here? Do the tax benefits of owning AU property trump any potential future outperformance of owning EM stocks instead?",

The current preference of Australian investors to overweight US stocks is probably in part due to the common fallacy of investors to look at past exceptional performance to extrapolate exceptional performance in the future . Emerging market stocks are not_however . The PE ratios are low and sentiment around EM stocks is pessimistic . They have done poorly the past 2 decades after all . Meanwhile developing countries particularly in Asia seem to be making progress modernising and see no_signs of slowing down . People there are industrious educated and intelligent while Westerners doing the same jobs are often complacent entitled and lazy . So what Im saying here is that EM stocks to my eye are cheap and are a solid bet and that Australian property is overrated and expensive . Is there some argument for Australian property Im not_seeing here Do the tax benefits of owning AU property trump any potential future outperformance of owning EM stocks instead"

      "selftext": "I was born in 1998. My generation hasn’t experienced a serious market drawdown in our adult lifetime. Every asset class has gone up consistently, fueled by massive central bank stimulus quantitative easing (QE) that began in 2008. I can’t help but wonder how brutal the next real crash might be, especially considering that most of us born around the same time and now working in finance with real responsibilities have never lived through one. We just dont know what real f*cking market fear is. The new “truth” seems to be that a 10% annual return in the stock market is guaranteed, and that the risk free rate despite now yielding about the same as the S&P 500 earnings yield is for fools. I feel like freaking Gandalf, sitting in Minas Tirith, reading ancient scrolls about the ring that once existed, that no one believes could return. Except in this case, it’s “stocks can actually fall for long periods”. There was a time when stocks were considered risky, and people understood that. Now I hear friends talk about mutual funds like they’re savings accounts: “10% returns, locked in.” And since we’ve never seen anything close to a long lasting market drawdown with real fear, I can’t even imagine how badly people will panic. Just a few weeks ago, people were already calling for the Fed to step in when the S&P was still at 5000. God, when I look at my friends and our generation, I can’t stand that the only thing left is to hope we actually get a lesson. There’s an ATH of fools running around thinking they’re f*cking George Soros on Main Street. We need a 1929 event, and we need it now. I don’t care if I have to live in a tent",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m planning to start investing more consistently and could use some perspective from people with more experience. My plan is to invest around €500 every few months, with a long-term horizon (10+ years). I’m not looking for quick gains, mainly preservation of value with a reasonable long-term return. I’ve been considering a few options: Physical gold, but many people say it’s not the best idea right now since it’s at an all-time high. An S&P 500 ETF, but I also keep seeing comments that the index is currently “too high” to enter. Some Asian/emerging markets ETFs, but opinions on those are mixed as well. So now I’m a bit stuck, it feels like everything is “not a good idea right now,” which doesn’t make sense if I want to invest regularly. Given today’s market conditions, what would you consider a sensible long-term investment strategy for someone contributing periodically and not trying to time the market? All advice and perspectives are welcome.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone I ’ m planning to start investing more consistently and could use some perspective from people with more experience . My plan is to invest around €500 every few months with a longterm horizon 10 years . I ’ m not_looking for quick gains mainly preservation of value with a reasonable longterm return . I ’ ve been considering a few options Physical gold but many people say it ’ s not_the best idea right now since it ’ s at an alltime high . An SP 500 ETF but I also keep seeing comments that the index is currently “ too high ” to enter . Some Asianemerging markets ETFs but opinions on those are mixed as well . So now I ’ m a bit stuck it feels like everything is “ not a good idea right now ” which doesn ’ t make sense if I want to invest regularly . Given today ’ s market conditions what would you consider a sensible longterm investment strategy for someone contributing periodically and not_trying to time the market All advice and perspectives are welcome ."

      "selftext": "I’m reviewing research for the 2026–2030 cycle that suggests we are entering a period of sticky inflation driven by tariffs and deficits, alongside a weakening labor market that headline GDP isn't capturing. The argument is that standard nominal bonds will fail to protect purchasing power if the Fed cuts rates to support the economy while inflation remains above target. Is there a prudent case for tilting towards Small Cap Value, Gold, and Managed Futures to hedge this specific environment, or is this just unnecessary complexity compared to a standard total market approach?",

The argument is that standard nominal bonds will fail to protect purchasing power if the Fed cuts rates to support the economy while inflation remains above target . Is there a prudent case for tilting towards Small Cap Value Gold and Managed Futures to hedge this specific environment or is this just unnecessary complexity compared to a standard total market approach"

My brain considers investing as an almost 10% guarantee over a 40 year timespan when I retire, with volatility being ironed out by time in the market, but when you apply that to any of the top individual companies, that 10% annual return gives valuations that my brain can’t comprehend and interprets as ludicrous. Could we really see companies like Apple or Microsoft (or some other company that might take over in the future) or whoever else being valued at 30 trillion in 40 years time? Or is the stock market hitting some unknown limit of size? I believe the stock market will grow more, but when you consider that growth being driven by companies being valued at 10s of trillions, it all seems impossible!",

      "selftext": "I’ve twice previously posted on Verticals valuation; this time I want to focus on their quality. If you go to the investors section of Verticals website, you’ll see many individuals with impressive resumes who are all familiar with senior positions. I’m just going to focus briefly on 3 of the most recent recruits and their most pertinent previous roles. Patrick Ky joined Verticals board at the beginning of September 2025 following 10 years as Executive Director of The European Aviation Safety Agency. The European equivalent of the FAA. Lord Andrew Parker joined the board in June 2025 after serving as Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household, acting as the main channel of communication between the monarch and the House of Lords. This following a long career at MI5 (UK equivalent of FBI) where from 2013 to 2020 he served as Director General. Carsten Stendevad joined in May 2025. He was previously the CEO of ATP, Denmark’s national pension plan. These three people have a couple of things in common. First and chief among them is integrity. These are people whose lives are built upon it. The second is that they are not short of options, and yet Dómhnal Slattery, an aerospace entrepreneur with almost 40 years’ experience was able to cherry pick them for his board. One final thought, how would the market react if the former head of the FAA, the former head of the FBI and the former head of say The Federal Reserve were to join the board of one of Verticals peers? Massive thanks to Prof G for the “Heads Up”. Adam",

If you go to the investors section of Verticals website you ’ ll see many individuals with impressive resumes who are all familiar with senior positions . I ’ m just going to focus briefly on 3 of the most recent recruits and their most pertinent previous roles . Patrick Ky joined Verticals board at the beginning of September 2025 following 10 years as Executive Director of The European Aviation Safety Agency . The European equivalent of the FAA . Lord Andrew Parker joined the board in June 2025 after serving as Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household acting as the main channel of communication between the monarch and the House of Lords . This following a long career at MI5 UK equivalent of FBI where from 2013 to 2020 he served as Director General . Carsten Stendevad joined in May 2025 . He was previously the CEO of ATP Denmark ’ s national pension plan . These three people have a couple of things in common . First and chief among them is integrity . These are people whose lives are built upon it . The second is that they are not_short of options and yet Dómhnal Slattery an aerospace entrepreneur with almost 40 years ’ experience was able to cherry pick them for his board . One final thought how would the market react if the former head of the FAA the former head of the FBI and the former head of say The Federal Reserve were to join the board of one of Verticals peers Massive thanks to Prof G for the “ Heads Up ” .

I have made around 4k over 2025 by doing it and learning more with it. My question is would it be smarter for me to just be investing my money into a roth ira at this age and letting it build over time or just keep doing what i’m doing and push for an earlier retirement through a taxable account, i contribute about 10-12k a year into my taxable account and the amount i’ll invest each year will go up as I get older",

      "title": "Robinhood froze my ~$160k account 18+ months ago after misreading a police email",
      "selftext": "I’m posting from a throwaway because this whole thing has been a nightmare and I don’t want it tied back to my main. About a year and a half ago my ex, who was very abusive, filed an online report saying I was selling weed after I finally left her. I’m in Texas, so the cops went all in. They arrested me, searched my house, took all my electronics and paperwork, and even towed both of my cars and ripped through them. The only “drugs” they found were legal CBD gummies and a couple of CBD drinks I bought from a shop by a college, and I had receipts for everything. Their own field test and then the lab both came back with no THC. I was never charged with anything. They still tried to take my stuff using civil forfeiture, so I hired a lawyer and spent around 50k fighting it. That case is now over. All my property has been returned and there are no charges and no open criminal cases against me. During the investigation, one cop sent a generic “this person is under investigation” email to all my banks and to Robinhood. It was not a court order, not a levy, nothing that said “freeze this account.” All of my banks and credit card companies ignored it. Only Robinhood decided to lock my brokerage account. The account is around 160k, mostly in three big stocks I’ve held since the COVID crash. Since then, the police and the city attorney have put in writing that there is no hold, no lien, no legal freeze, and that they don’t plan to go after my Robinhood funds at all. They’ve looked at the original email and basically said Robinhood misread it and treated it like something it isn’t. Robinhood has kept the account frozen for more than 18 months now. Every time I contact support, I get the same copy-paste answer about “our team is reviewing this, we can’t give a timeline.” I’ve filed complaints with regulators. The lawyer who handled the forfeiture case has a hearing on the 15th where he’s going to ask a judge to officially say there was never any freeze or lien, but he doesn’t really know Robinhood/FINRA stuff and I don’t have money for a second lawyer. Meanwhile I’m sitting on credit card debt and money I owe family while my savings are locked. Can Robinhood legally keep my account frozen this long when there’s no court order, no lien, and no seizure according to the city attorney and police, or is this something I can realistically take to arbitration or court and expect to win? What legal steps, if any, actually exist to force them to act instead of just sending the same “under review” response? For the hearing on the 15th, I don’t even know what my lawyer should be asking the judge for beyond some kind of order clearly saying there was never any freeze or lien and nothing on the government side stopping Robinhood from releasing my funds. I’ve also wondered if it’s even possible for a judge to order the police or city to send some kind of “release” email when the police are saying there was never a freeze in the first place. If I do end up in arbitration or a lawsuit, I’d like to know whether there’s any realistic chance of getting extra damages for how long this has gone on and the financial mess it’s caused, or if it usually just ends with the account finally being opened. And I’d really appreciate guidance on what type of lawyer actually handles this kind of Robinhood/FINRA situation and how to find one who knows what they’re doing.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m posting from a throwaway because this whole thing has been a nightmare and I don ’ t want it tied back to my main . About a year and a half ago my ex who was very abusive filed an online report saying I was selling weed after I finally left her . I ’ m in Texas so the cops went all in . They arrested me searched my house took all my electronics and paperwork and even towed both of my cars and ripped through them . The only “ drugs ” they found were legal CBD gummies and a couple of CBD drinks I bought from a shop by a college and I had receipts for everything . Their own field test and then the lab both came back with no_THC . I was never_charged with anything . They still tried to take my stuff using civil forfeiture so I hired a lawyer and spent around 50k fighting it . That case is now over . All my property has been returned and there are no_charges and no_open criminal cases against me . During the investigation one cop sent a generic “ this person is under investigation ” email to all my banks and to Robinhood . It was not_a court order not_a levy nothing_that said “ freeze this account. ” All of my banks and credit card companies ignored it . Only Robinhood decided to lock my brokerage account . The account is around 160k mostly in three big stocks I ’ ve held since the COVID crash . Since then the police and the city attorney have put in writing that there is no_hold no_lien no_legal freeze and that they don ’ t plan to go after my Robinhood funds at all . They ’ ve looked at the original email and basically said Robinhood misread it and treated it like something it isn ’ t . Robinhood has kept the account frozen for more than 18 months now . Every time I contact support I get the same copypaste answer about “ our team is reviewing this we can ’ t give a timeline. ” I ’ ve filed complaints with regulators . The lawyer who handled the forfeiture case has a hearing on the 15th where he ’ s going to ask a judge to officially say there was never_any freeze or lien but he doesn ’ t really know RobinhoodFINRA stuff and I don ’ t have money for a second lawyer . Meanwhile I ’ m sitting on credit card debt and money I owe family while my savings are locked . Can Robinhood legally keep my account frozen this long when there ’ s no_court order no_lien and no_seizure according to the city attorney and police or is this something I can realistically take to arbitration or court and expect to win What legal steps if any actually exist to force them to act instead of just sending the same “ under review ” response For the hearing on the 15th I don ’ t even know what my lawyer should be asking the judge for beyond some kind of order clearly saying there was never_any freeze or lien and nothing_on the government side stopping Robinhood from releasing my funds . I ’ ve also wondered if it ’ s even possible for a judge to order the police or city to send some kind of “ release ” email when the police are saying there was never_a freeze in the first place . If I do end up in arbitration or a lawsuit I ’ d like to know whether there ’ s any realistic chance of getting extra damages for how long this has gone on and the financial mess it ’ s caused or if it usually just ends with the account finally being opened . And I ’ d really appreciate guidance on what type of lawyer actually handles this kind of RobinhoodFINRA situation and how to find one who knows what they ’ re doing ."

      "title": "Google - not AMD - is Nvidia’s greatest threat because of their full-stack AI and AlphaEvolve",
      "selftext": "AMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else, but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company’s conception. Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000: \"Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we had the ultimate search engine, it would understand everything on the web; it would understand, um, you know, exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. And that's obviously artificial intelligence.\"[ Google Co-Founder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI (2000)]( \\- For those that don’t know, it was supposedly Larry Page’s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI. # Full-stack AI Now, imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation. Your first thought will probably be: Which should I pick? ChatGPT immediately comes to mind, but you want to do your research properly. Through your research, you find that Google's Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck, at least among American AI models. Plus, they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model. Perfect. Google seems like a good choice. Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity (especially if they improve). But what about implementation? Google offers enterprise-ready API:s via Vertex with more features coming like auth, database and payments, Google Cloud for storage, and now even at location TPU:s that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible. Super. Suddenly, your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google, and along the way, you never touch an Nvidia product. But before you make your final decision, you ask yourself: Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term, so I don’t get vendor-locked with an inferior offering? I’ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never want to bet against the man - and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way. I don’t imagine Nvidia is particularly - or really at all - threatened by Google in the short term, though Google's TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices, reducing profit margin. Apparently, OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it, according to[ Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis]( worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia. Though what is actually important is not the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future. # AlphaEvolve I allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed[ AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms]( The evolutionary AI system had, in secret, improved everything from the training of their AI models to Google's hardware, i.e., their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multi-billion dollar deal for them, with Meta considering the same. The remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro, not even Gemini 2.5. Today, it’s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations, and in the future, it will use far more powerful models than that. Meaning that the better Google’s AI models get, the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google’s models and hardware. The cheaper and better Google’s hardware, the more powerful models can be built and run. The more powerful the models, the better the hardware. And so on. Better AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia’s CUDA moat. One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code, causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA. But once AI models become sufficiently advanced, the programming difficulty may not be a concern, or Google and Gemini create some CUDA-variant of their own. Rumors also exist of them doing just that. # All in all This means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business, it’s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia. If they do it often enough, AI labs will eventually wonder: can you build better AI models without Nvidia? This will be especially true if other AI-labs do it too:[ “resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs”]( Does this mean I think Nvidia is done for? Not at all, as I said, I've spent enough time studying Jensen that I'd never want to bet against him. After all, he is a man who roommated with a 17-year-old ex-con covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5-trillion-dollar man. Jensen has a ton of cards to play, and he’s already playing them perfectly. Nvidia still has a hardware/hardware-software lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future. If they make a substantial compute leap, Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia’s AI lab, absorb one of the AI labs, or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race. He is securing long-term deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia. Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development. He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem. Nvidia will likely begin to offer full-stack solutions of its own. And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia, Google and AMD. **Disclaimer:** I hold a significant long position in Google (Alphabet). The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not constitute financial or investment advice. Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions. **TLDR;** Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term, though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin. But over the long term, Google’s full stack offerings - AI models/applications, cloud and TPUs - with AI model’s designed to improve AI models and hardware (AlphaEvolve) getting better, Google might even take a long term lead. Though, Jensen is playing Nvidia’s cards perfectly.",

      "selftext_processed": "AMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company ’ s conception . Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000 Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google . So we had the ultimate search engine it would understand everything on the web it would understand um you know exactly what you wanted and it would give you the right thing . And thats obviously artificial intelligence . Google CoFounder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI 2000 For those that don ’ t know it was supposedly Larry Page ’ s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI . Fullstack AI Now imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation . Your first thought will probably be Which should I pick ChatGPT immediately comes to mind but you want to do your research properly . Through your research you find that Googles Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck at least among American AI models . Plus they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model . Perfect . Google seems like a good choice . Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity especially if they improve . But what about implementation Google offers enterpriseready APIs via Vertex with more features coming like auth database and payments Google Cloud for storage and now even at location TPUs that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible . Super . Suddenly your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google and along the way you never_touch an Nvidia product . But before you make your final decision you ask yourself Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term so I don ’ t get vendorlocked with an inferior offering I ’ ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never_want to bet against the man and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way . I don ’ t imagine Nvidia is particularly or really at all threatened by Google in the short term though Googles TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices reducing profit margin . Apparently OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it according to Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia . Though what is actually important is not_the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future . AlphaEvolve I allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve A Geminipowered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms The evolutionary AI system had in secret improved everything from the training of their AI models to Googles hardware i.e . their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multibillion dollar deal for them with Meta considering the same . The remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro not_even Gemini 2.5 . Today it ’ s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations and in the future it will use far more powerful models than that . Meaning that the better Google ’ s AI models get the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google ’ s models and hardware . The cheaper and better Google ’ s hardware the more powerful models can be built and run . The more powerful the models the better the hardware . And so on . Better AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia ’ s CUDA moat . One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA . But once AI models become sufficiently advanced the programming difficulty may not_be a concern or Google and Gemini create some CUDAvariant of their own . Rumors also exist of them doing just that . All in all This means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business it ’ s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia . If they do it often enough AI labs will eventually wonder can you build better AI models without Nvidia This will be especially true if other AIlabs do it too “ resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs ” Does this mean I think Nvidia is done for Not_at all as I said Ive spent enough time studying Jensen that Id never_want to bet against him . After all he is a man who roommated with a 17yearold excon covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5trilliondollar man . Jensen has a ton of cards to play and he ’ s already playing them perfectly . Nvidia still has a hardwarehardwaresoftware lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future . If they make a substantial compute leap Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia ’ s AI lab absorb one of the AI labs or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race . He is securing longterm deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia . Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development . He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem . Nvidia will likely begin to offer fullstack solutions of its own . And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia Google and AMD . Disclaimer I hold a significant long position in Google Alphabet . The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not_constitute financial or investment advice . Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions . TLDR Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin . But over the long term Google ’ s full stack offerings AI modelsapplications cloud and TPUs with AI model ’ s designed to improve AI models and hardware AlphaEvolve getting better Google might even take a long term lead . Though Jensen is playing Nvidia ’ s cards perfectly ."

      "title": "$2.4 Million Bet On RIVN - Cursed Carmaker Turnaround",
      "selftext": "Hey! First post on WSB. Here's why I'm betting big on Rivian: **Customers Love The Product** Talk to anyone you know who owns a Rivian, currently owns another EV and wants an upgrade, or posts on any of the EV/Rivian forums or subreddits. The product has well-documented reliability issues and despite that is still #1 in EV customer satisfaction. According to Consumer Reports' November 2025 survey, 86% of Rivian owners would buy again. BMW comes in second at 77%. Tesla is third at 75% with complaints about build quality. **CEO Has The Right Stuff** If you're seriously considering investing in Rivian, I urge you to watch an RJ Scaringe interview ([Here's one]( with John Collison, founder of Stripe). I've listened to hundreds of business and world leader interviews, and this guy comes across as one of the most authentic, ambitious, and competent CEOs out there. He got his PhD from MIT Sloan Automotive Lab and started Rivian in 2009. His passion for cars and specifically building the best possible electric vehicle from a product perspective really shows. Rivian is often compared to Lucid as car companies that IPO'd and fell off a cliff but are still hanging around. Lucid's leadership does not hold a candle to this guy. Go watch them yourself (Marc Winterhoff, Peter Rawlinson) and see the difference. **Solid Company Culture** I don't look at Glassdoor. Tech people tell you what they really feel about their companies on [Blind]( Before making an investment in a tech company, I always look at Blind reviews to get an overall feel for what it's like working there. For example, I don't want to see things like \"excellent work-life balance\" or \"nepotism\" because they suggest an unproductive environment. The overall vibe I get from Rivian is a fast-paced, scrappy startup that makes a lot of mistakes and pivots frequently. I like that. **The R2 Is A Game-Changer** At a much more accessible $45,000 base and slightly smaller than the R1S, production begins in early 2026 at their massive new VW-backed Georgia plant. This one makes or breaks the company, and initial reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. They're also planning a smaller, cheaper R3 crossover later in 2026. **Autonomy & AI Day On Dec 11** Rivian will likely unveil hands-free driving features, an overview of their sensor stack, and future autonomous roadmap. Not yet comparable to Tesla, but any unexpected good news here can boost the stock. **Amazon Delivery Vehicles** Rivian built about 2.5% of Amazon's fleet (30,000 vehicles) with a projection of over 10% by 2030 as gas vans are phased out. Rivian currently accounts for about 80-90% of Amazon's EV fleet. Take a look around you. If you see a cute-looking Amazon van, on the side you'll notice it's \"powered by Rivian\". **Platform Architecture Joint Venture With VW** With VW's financial backing, Rivian is developing a modular, vertically-integrated EV software stack. VW already plans to use it across its brands, giving Rivian a software licensing revenue stream. Any other manufacturer adopting the platform would be a major win. **Major Institutional Backing** Amazon owns 13% and VW owns 12.3% of Rivian. A welcome vote of confidence, given how closely they work together. Vanguard (6%), BlackRock (4%), UBS (1.6%) and a whole host of other well-known institutional investors are in as well. **The Chart Looks Awfully Like Major Accumulation** I'll admit it - I'm an astrologer. But you can't look at this chart and say something didn't change after the last earnings call. Popped from 12-18, consolidated at 14.5-15, and headed higher all within a month. Every intraday dip is getting bought back up with intensity. This stock has been beaten down for so long that many potential investors who love the company are waiting for it to drop to 12-13 again \"like it always does.\" It has steadily been making higher lows (6 separate times since Apr 2024 - roughly 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and just recently 14) and once it breaks out, all these dip buyers who are waiting for Godot are going to have to buy in much higher. **Some Personal Anecdotes** * An AI/ML PhD friend of mine currently working in the self-driving space claimed that Tesla FSD (Full Self-Driving) is a \"long-running failure\", bought Rivian stock because he \"likes the car and company\" and will buy a Rivian as his next vehicle. * My scammer ex-girlfriend had a Tesla but wanted me to buy a Rivian for her. I didn't, but every time we'd drive around town and she saw one she'd point at it and excitedly say \"Rivian!\" in that cute little Russian accent of hers. I don't miss her all that much, she was a complete pain in the ass. Really, I don't.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey First post on WSB . Heres why Im betting big on Rivian Customers Love The Product Talk to anyone you know who owns a Rivian currently owns another EV and wants an upgrade or posts on any of the EVRivian forums or subreddits . The product has welldocumented reliability issues and despite that is still 1 in EV customer satisfaction . According to Consumer Reports November 2025 survey 86 % of Rivian owners would buy again . BMW comes in second at 77 % . Tesla is third at 75 % with complaints about build quality . CEO Has The Right Stuff If youre seriously considering investing in Rivian I urge you to watch an RJ Scaringe interview Heres one with John Collison founder of Stripe . Ive listened to hundreds of business and world leader interviews and this guy comes across as one of the most authentic ambitious and competent CEOs out there . He got his PhD from MIT Sloan Automotive Lab and started Rivian in 2009 . His passion for cars and specifically building the best possible electric vehicle from a product perspective really shows . Rivian is often compared to Lucid as car companies that IPOd and fell off a cliff but are still hanging around . Lucids leadership does not_hold a candle to this guy . Go watch them yourself Marc Winterhoff Peter Rawlinson and see the difference . Solid Company Culture I dont look at Glassdoor . Tech people tell you what they really feel about their companies on Blind Before making an investment in a tech company I always look at Blind reviews to get an overall feel for what its like working there . For example I dont want to see things like excellent worklife balance or nepotism because they suggest an unproductive environment . The overall vibe I get from Rivian is a fastpaced scrappy startup that makes a lot of mistakes and pivots frequently . I like that . The R2 Is A GameChanger At a much more accessible $ 45000 base and slightly smaller than the R1S production begins in early 2026 at their massive new VWbacked Georgia plant . This one makes or breaks the company and initial reviews have been overwhelmingly positive . Theyre also planning a smaller cheaper R3 crossover later in 2026 . Autonomy AI Day On Dec 11 Rivian will likely unveil handsfree driving features an overview of their sensor stack and future autonomous roadmap . Not_yet comparable to Tesla but any unexpected good news here can boost the stock . Amazon Delivery Vehicles Rivian built about 2.5 % of Amazons fleet 30000 vehicles with a projection of over 10 % by 2030 as gas vans are phased out . Rivian currently accounts for about 8090 % of Amazons EV fleet . Take a look around you . If you see a cutelooking Amazon van on the side youll notice its powered by Rivian . Platform Architecture Joint Venture With VW With VWs financial backing Rivian is developing a modular verticallyintegrated EV software stack . VW already plans to use it across its brands giving Rivian a software licensing revenue stream . Any other manufacturer adopting the platform would be a major win . Major Institutional Backing Amazon owns 13 % and VW owns 12.3 % of Rivian . A welcome vote of confidence given how closely they work together . Vanguard 6 % BlackRock 4 % UBS 1.6 % and a whole host of other wellknown institutional investors are in as well . The Chart Looks Awfully Like Major Accumulation Ill admit it Im an astrologer . But you cant look at this chart and say something didnt change after the last earnings call . Popped from 1218 consolidated at 14.515 and headed higher all within a month . Every intraday dip is getting bought back up with intensity . This stock has been beaten down for so long that many potential investors who love the company are waiting for it to drop to 1213 again like it always does . It has steadily been making higher lows 6 separate times since Apr 2024 roughly 8 9 10 11 12 and just recently 14 and once it breaks out all these dip buyers who are waiting for Godot are going to have to buy in much higher . Some Personal Anecdotes An AIML PhD friend of mine currently working in the selfdriving space claimed that Tesla FSD Full SelfDriving is a longrunning failure bought Rivian stock because he likes the car and company and will buy a Rivian as his next vehicle . My scammer exgirlfriend had a Tesla but wanted me to buy a Rivian for her . I didnt but every time wed drive around town and she saw one shed point at it and excitedly say Rivian in that cute little Russian accent of hers . I dont miss her all that much she was a complete pain in the ass . Really I dont ."

      "selftext": "Netflix has prevailed in its bid to buy much of Warner Bros. Discovery, agreeing to pay $72 billion for the Burbank-based Warner Bros. film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO. The two companies announced the blockbuster deal early Friday morning. The deal would give Netflix such beloved characters as Batman, Harry Potter and Fred Flintstone. “Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a statement. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies — from timeless classics like ‘Casablanca’ and ‘Citizen Kane’ to modern favorites like ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Friends’ — with our culture-defining titles like ‘Stranger Things,’ ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ and ‘Squid Game,’ we’ll be able to do that even better.” Netflix’s cash and stock transaction is valued at about $27.75 per Warner Bros. Discovery shares. Netflix also agreed to take on more than $10 billion in Warner Bros. debt, pushing the deal’s value to $82.7 billion. The breakthrough came late Thursday, soon after a deadline for deal sweeteners. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast had submitted bids earlier in the week as jockeying intensified for Hollywood’s biggest prize.",

Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, is also calling for the next evolution in market infrastructure, saying tokenization will transform finance. And everybody with a brain still firing neurons knows that tokenization will mainly happen on Ethereum. Traditional stock platforms take days to settle and won’t even allow you to swap one share for another — the current financial market is slow and non-lenient. Thankfully, decentralized and trustworthy Ethereum and their smart contracts are finally ready to change that, because digital is the future, and the financial markets are currently stuck in the centralized past, outside of the decentralized, democratized blockchain. Despite the biggest dogs calling for a financial revolution built on Ethereum, Ethereum has been flat for the last 5 years. This is your final chance to get your supercharged Ethereum golden ticket, BMNR, before the biggest evolution in market infrastructure reprices Ethereum forever.",

Traditional stock platforms take days to settle and won ’ t even allow you to swap one share for another — the current financial market is slow and nonlenient . Thankfully decentralized and trustworthy Ethereum and their smart contracts are finally ready to change that because digital is the future and the financial markets are currently stuck in the centralized past outside of the decentralized democratized blockchain .

      "selftext": "From doing past analysis, I realized that most people, including myself, miss out on life-changing huge gains because we sell our stocks too early. There are ton of stocks that within 1Y went up 100-200% and some over 5Y went up 1000%-3000%. One thing I noticed people like to do is day-trade or swing-trade and they feel good making a few thousand in one trade in just a few days. They think that they just made their monthly salary in a quick amount of time effortlessly. But then afterwards, the stock that they just sold ends up going up +30% in one day suddenly, then continues to go up consistently day by day, +5%, +7%, +3%... and so on, eventually before you know it, the stock has already went up +100%. Personally, I have changed my strategy and adopted more of a buy-and-hold approach. I view each share as precious and something that could be cheap now could be very valuable in the future. Hence, I try my absolute best not to sell any share unless I want to take profit and switch the money to either a defensive cash position to wait and buy dips/crashes, or switch the money to another stock that I feel has higher growth potential.",

      "title": "TAL EDUCATION $TAL – A Bet on China Policy Shift",
      "selftext": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist. I've been openly bullish on Chinese equities, not blindly on the macro, but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years. My core China positions are BABA, BILI, WB, PDD, etc., and while digging through various research notes and podcasts, TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse. **Here's my thinking:** China's economy has been hit hard, much of it self-inflicted. The real estate crisis hit consumption, valuations eventually collapsed, Western capital stepped away, and the regulatory wave in 2020-2021 crushed entire industries overnight, private education/tutoring being one of the hardest hit. TAL, a leader in the space, went from a \\~$90 stock to a \\~$1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed. But today, the macro backdrop is subtly shifting. Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy, support job creation, and encourage entrepreneurship. Real estate cleanup efforts are underway, consumer data, while not amazing, is, and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift. None of this screams \"China is fixed,\" but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction. **The Key Catalyst: Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions** One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinese-focused podcasts and panels is this: Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education. Remember: the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out China's private tutoring industry, which had been massive. TAL went from a \\~$90 stock to $1. That was the market pricing in near-death. Logic behind potential easing makes sense: * ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer * ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category * It acted as a foundational support for talent creation. Which is now a h * Households spend \\~17% of income on education (\\~5x the global average) * Investment + hiring + innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured, regulated private education aligns with national goals, especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs. Beijing seeks to nurture local talent, enhance educational outcomes, and boost household spending. Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense, as it can stimulate the economy, revive consumption, and promote upward mobility. This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules, making it a rational strategy. The Kicker: If the tutoring industry reopens, even partially, TAL and New Oriental (EDU) would effectively operate as a duopoly. Heavy compliance requirements + political scrutiny = massive barriers to new entrants. For Beijing, this is actually preferable, and for investors, even more so. **Why TAL Specifically?** This is no longer the old hyper-growth, hyper-aggressive, burn-capital tutoring giant. TAL today is: * Leaner * ﻿﻿More tech-driven * Operating within defined regulatory lanes * ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves * ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward ed-tech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly, TAL's operational muscle memory, national presence, brand trust, and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage. Think of it as a coiled spring. Regulatory easing doesn't need to revive 2019 TAL. It just needs to allow profitable, compliant business lines to scale. The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $8 and $11 for months. It's been essentially flat, under-owned, and overlooked. For me, this is what an asymmetric setup looks like: limited structural downside, but substantial upside if policy shifts in TAL's favor. A re-rating doesn't require TAL to return to its old model-it simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries. **MY POSITION:** 200 Contracts of the $10 Strike, Jan 15 2027 Calls Paid an Average of $3.5 in premiums for a total of $71,712 **TL;DR** * ﻿﻿China may be easing or clarifying the 2021 tutoring crackdown-big potential catalyst. * Education is huge in China: households spend \\~17% of income on it (\\~5x global avg). * Reopening the sector helps job creation, consumption, and talent development. * ﻿﻿If rules loosen, TAL + EDU become a near-duopoly due to heavy compliance barriers * ﻿﻿Stock has been range-bound ($8-$11) but sentiment + policy tone in China is improving. * I'm in Jan 2027 $10 calls (200 contracts, \\~$72K) as a long-term bet.",

      "selftext_processed": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist . Ive been openly bullish on Chinese equities not_blindly on the macro but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years . My core China positions are BABA BILI WB PDD etc . and while digging through various research notes and podcasts TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse . Heres my thinking Chinas economy has been hit hard much of it selfinflicted . The real estate crisis hit consumption valuations eventually collapsed Western capital stepped away and the regulatory wave in 20202021 crushed entire industries overnight private educationtutoring being one of the hardest hit . TAL a leader in the space went from a $ 90 stock to a $ 1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed . But today the macro backdrop is subtly shifting . Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy support job creation and encourage entrepreneurship . Real estate cleanup efforts are underway consumer data while not_amazing is and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift . None of this screams China is fixed but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction . The Key Catalyst Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinesefocused podcasts and panels is this Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education . Remember the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out Chinas private tutoring industry which had been massive . TAL went from a $ 90 stock to $ 1 . That was the market pricing in neardeath . Logic behind potential easing makes sense ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category It acted as a foundational support for talent creation . Which is now a h Households spend 17 % of income on education 5x the global average Investment hiring innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured regulated private education aligns with national goals especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs . Beijing seeks to nurture local talent enhance educational outcomes and boost household spending . Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense as it can stimulate the economy revive consumption and promote upward mobility . This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules making it a rational strategy . The Kicker If the tutoring industry reopens even partially TAL and New Oriental EDU would effectively operate as a duopoly . Heavy compliance requirements political scrutiny massive barriers to new entrants . For Beijing this is actually preferable and for investors even more so . Why TAL Specifically This is no_longer the old hypergrowth hyperaggressive burncapital tutoring giant . TAL today is Leaner ﻿﻿More techdriven Operating within defined regulatory lanes ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward edtech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly TALs operational muscle memory national presence brand trust and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage . Think of it as a coiled spring . Regulatory easing doesnt need to revive 2019 TAL . It just needs to allow profitable compliant business lines to scale . The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $ 8 and $ 11 for months . Its been essentially flat underowned and overlooked . For me this is what an asymmetric setup looks like limited structural downside but substantial upside if policy shifts in TALs favor . A rerating doesnt require TAL to return to its old modelit simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries .
