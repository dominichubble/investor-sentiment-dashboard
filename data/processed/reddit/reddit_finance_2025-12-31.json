I’ve been pretty optimistic about AI, but I was looking at the data recently and it’s freaking me out. Retail investors are buying in at record highs, but corporate insiders are selling at a 27:1 ratio right now. Why is 'smart money' cashing out so aggressively? Then you look at SoftBank, they are literally selling their winning stocks (Nvidia, T-Mobile) just to scrape together cash to pay OpenAI by the end of the year. It honestly feels like the whole industry is just trying to keep the valuation inflated long enough to IPO OpenAI next year so the VCs can exit. I don’t want to be a fearmonger but does this look like a massive wealth transfer setup to anyone else? Or am I just overthinking it? I know this isn't too different from the whole 'AI bubble' panic but I feel like the timeline seems more concrete now with Google's soon-to-be lead in AI.",

      "selftext": "33m planning to retire at 60. I'm currently making \\~125k/year. With inflation/lifestyle I'm expecting to need \\~200K/year in retirement. * Roth IRA $13,000 in SCHD. I'm contributing the 7K/yr from this point forward. Estimating 5% share price growth rate and 8.5% dividend growth rate. * At 60 this would be worth \\~1.6M with dividends bringing in about \\~125K/yr * at 65 this would be worth \\~2.8M with dividends bringing in about \\~316K/yr * At 70 this would be worth \\~6.2M with dividends bringing in about \\~830K/yr * 401K $160,000 in FXAIX. I'm only contributing up to the employer match. Estimated 8% returns * At 60 this would be worth \\~2-2.5M * \\~240K/yr gets me through about 9 years (including a continued return) * HSA $5,500 in FXAIX. I'm contributing 7,800/yr from this point forward. Estimated 8% returns * At 65 this would be worth \\~1.2M I should have enough money in my 401K to easily get me through \\~7 years. At 67 I should be making somewhere in the ballpark of 450K/year of tax free dividends. I will also still have my HSA growing in the background, unless it's needed for health. I guess what I'm asking is: 1. Is my math mathing? 2. Wouldn't this leave me/my family in an unbelievable position when I inevitably kick the bucket? Just shift to the dividend life at \\~67 and reinvest whatever I don't use. 3. What am I missing? It's late... I have to be missing something.",

Im contributing 7800yr from this point forward . Estimated 8 % returns At 65 this would be worth 1.2M I should have enough money in my 401K to easily get me through 7 years . At 67 I should be making somewhere in the ballpark of 450Kyear of tax free dividends . I will also still have my HSA growing in the background unless its needed for health . I guess what Im asking is 1 . Is my math mathing 2 . Wouldnt this leave memy family in an unbelievable position when I inevitably kick the bucket Just shift to the dividend life at 67 and reinvest whatever I dont use . 3 . What am I missing Its late ... I have to be missing something ."

I understand RKLB is priced as a high-growth stock as it should be, but it seems as though FOMO and hype surrounding the space industry has risen to an unsustainable level. At 68X sales it looks like RKLB is almost priced for perfection. That being said, RKLB is an amazing company with an incredible opportunity to take significant market share as the 2nd space company in the US behind SpaceX. I know many of you likely got in early and will be holding long term. What I would love to hear is your thoughts on its current valuation relative to where the company is today. No one can predict the future, but do you think $70/share is a fair price to pay? If you had never invested in RKLB, would you now at the current price? Thanks in advance!",

      "selftext": "Couer Mining (CDE) closed the day at $18.09 according to VectorVest, they are valued at 32.5/ share. Therefore, they are extremely undervalued. Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026: They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD, a Canadian mining company. Once this merger goes through, they will have 7 operations across North America. They will have the production capability of 900,000oz of gold and 20,000,000oz of silver. They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit. They have had production expansion, like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas. Therefore, they are still growing. They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year. I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026. Their debt is mostly long-term, and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt. The coupon is fixed. I could not find the all-in sustaining cost, but it cost them $248m to sell $554.6m worth of gold and silver. All their mines are considered to be in safe areas; they have 3 in the US, 2 in Mexico, and 1 explorational site in BC. After the merger, they will acquire more sites in Canada. So none of the mines will be politically impacted. They have no active offering; as a matter of fact, they have a $75 million share buyback program valid through May 31, 2026. Their free cash flow is positive, at $188M.",

      "selftext_processed": "Couer Mining CDE closed the day at $ 18.09 according to VectorVest they are valued at 32.5 share . Therefore they are extremely undervalued . Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026 They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD a Canadian mining company . Once this merger goes through they will have 7 operations across North America . They will have the production capability of 900000oz of gold and 20000000oz of silver . They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit . They have had production expansion like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas . Therefore they are still growing . They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year . I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026 . Their debt is mostly longterm and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt . The coupon is fixed . I could not_find the allin sustaining cost but it cost them $ 248m to sell $ 554.6m worth of gold and silver . All their mines are considered to be in safe areas they have 3 in the US 2 in Mexico and 1 explorational site in BC . After the merger they will acquire more sites in Canada . So none of the mines will be politically impacted . They have no_active offering as a matter of fact they have a $ 75 million share buyback program valid through May 31 2026 . Their free cash flow is positive at $ 188M ."

      "selftext": "Hello, stock traders. I thought I'd share an idea with you. On another subreddit I'm on, someone had posted a list of \"low RSI\" stocks he'd screened (less than 30, but >10, to weed out anomalies), with prices above $2. The idea being that these might be oversold and/or due to go up for whatever reasons. I've never felt like I could predict *if* a stock should go up, let alone *when*. But I can tell when one **is** going up. We all can. So my mind immediately went to the *other* extreme of RSI, and I filtered above 70 (and <90). Share price above $50, and Volume >50k were the only other filters I used. I got 46 hits on Barchart, and in hindsight I could've lowered the Volume filter to get more candidates. And maybe price, but I personally wouldn't go <$20. I sorted by 3-month performance so I could see which ones are currently going up. Then I started flipping through charts using Barchart's \"flipcharts\" feature. Candidates I liked, *strictly based on their charts* (no other research) were: ALB, AA, AUGO, PAAS, GM, RIO, FDX, TD, & BNS Then to decide which 3 of those I might choose (because I 'diversify' with just 3 tickers at a time), I charted those 9 against each other by 3's. That yielded these 3 charts: [9 stocks 3 ways, 6-month views]( Scroll down when you get to Imgur to see all 3 charts. (I use 6-month views even though I sort by 3m performance because it gives me a better idea of how a ticker got to where it is.) **Which stock from each chart would** ***you*** **choose?** I have an advantage because I could zoom in to the 3m view (and that influenced 2 picks), but I chose: >!AA, RIO, TD!< (Click to see. This is the 'spoiler' feature of Reddit.) As a final sanity check, I plotted them against each other, with SPY as the benchmark: [3 momentum picks vs SPY]( And tbh, I don't like how AA looks in this view, but that's down to it having been in the first tranche of 3, which were highest on the 3-month performance sort. But with the averaging effect of the other 2, I can live with it. I put in Market orders Sunday night in ThinkorSwim's Paper Money to buy them at Monday's open. They filled at: AA 52.50 RIO 80.46 TD 94.81 All 3 are down a bit after 2 days, but it's early yet. I could update this in a month or two if people are interested. Does anyone else do something like this?",

That yielded these 3 charts 9 stocks 3 ways 6month views Scroll down when you get to Imgur to see all 3 charts . I use 6month views even though I sort by 3m performance because it gives me a better idea of how a ticker got to where it is . Which stock from each chart would you choose I have an advantage because I could zoom in to the 3m view and that influenced 2 picks but I chose AA RIO TD Click to see . This is the spoiler feature of Reddit . As a final sanity check I plotted them against each other with SPY as the benchmark 3 momentum picks vs SPY And tbh I dont like how AA looks in this view but thats down to it having been in the first tranche of 3 which were highest on the 3month performance sort . But with the averaging effect of the other 2 I can live with it . I put in Market orders Sunday night in ThinkorSwims Paper Money to buy them at Mondays open . They filled at AA 52.50 RIO 80.46 TD 94.81 All 3 are down a bit after 2 days but its early yet . I could update this in a month or two if people are interested . Does anyone else do something like this"

      "selftext": "I’m about 10 years away from retiring. The 3% bonus into my Roth is very appealing. I know it’s only $240 (minus the $60 for gold) per year and if it was into a taxable account I probably would not bother but anything to get more money into my Roth. Already have accounts set up at the other major brokerages including a Roth. I am aware of the 5 year Robin Hood rule and I am ok with that. I have no problems having accounts at different brokerages (in fact I consider that a plus in case there is ever an issue with one of my other brokerages. ) Is it worth moving some of my money over from an existing Roth account (would only move a percentage, not all). One question, I assume the gold relationship is per person? So I couldn’t use it for both my spouse and myself to each contribute to a Roth and get the bonus 3% instead of 1? Also, can I buy CEFs, BDCs and MLPs through Robin Hood? Are there any issues with market or limit orders in terms of fill prices or anything (general question). I don’t panic trade (well at least I hope not) so I am not worried about accounts being locked up when I trying to get into a crypto position or something but would want to eventually move the money back to a more conventional brokerage in 5 years. I like the idea of a 3% back credit card, I really have no patience for the sector credit cards where they give you gas stations now and supermarkets the next quarter Any other benefits or downsides?",

I know it ’ s only $ 240 minus the $ 60 for gold per year and if it was into a taxable account I probably would not_bother but anything to get more money into my Roth . Already have accounts set up at the other major brokerages including a Roth . I am aware of the 5 year Robin Hood rule and I am ok with that . I have no_problems having accounts at different brokerages in fact I consider that a plus in case there is ever an issue with one of my other brokerages . Is it worth moving some of my money over from an existing Roth account would only move a percentage not_all . One question I assume the gold relationship is per person So I couldn ’ t use it for both my spouse and myself to each contribute to a Roth and get the bonus 3 % instead of 1 Also can I buy CEFs BDCs and MLPs through Robin Hood Are there any issues with market or limit orders in terms of fill prices or anything general question . I don ’ t panic trade well at least I hope not_so I am not_worried about accounts being locked up when I trying to get into a crypto position or something but would want to eventually move the money back to a more conventional brokerage in 5 years . I like the idea of a 3 % back credit card I really have no_patience for the sector credit cards where they give you gas stations now and supermarkets the next quarter Any other benefits or downsides"

      "title": "Unusual Move｜Tesla Directly Releases Analyst Forecasts: Q4 Deliveries May Drop 15%, Signaling Demand Pressure?",
      "selftext": "Tesla's stock price has fallen for six consecutive trading days. I just came across an unusual piece of news about Tesla (TSLA) and wanted to share it for discussion. Tesla recently proactively disclosed analysts' forecasts for its fourth-quarter deliveries, breaking from its usual low-key approach. According to these projections, fourth-quarter deliveries may decline by approximately 15% year-over-year, a rare occurrence in Tesla's history. Key factors contributing to demand pressure include: Phasing Out Tax Credits: The gradual withdrawal of electric vehicle subsidies in certain markets significantly impacts marginal demand Intensifying Competition: Traditional automakers and new energy vehicle manufacturers are simultaneously ramping up efforts, fueling ongoing price wars Diminishing demand pull-forward effect: Previous price cuts have already captured some future demand This “pre-disclosure” strategy has also sparked market speculation: Is Tesla actively managing market expectations? Does this signal greater near-term fundamental pressures than previously anticipated? Or is it merely paving the way for a reset in the 2025 growth trajectory? From a trading and investment perspective, this could yield two starkly different interpretations: Bearish View: The high-growth narrative is weakening, necessitating a re-evaluation of valuations. Bullish View: Releasing negative news early could actually mitigate the impact after earnings reports. Tesla currently sits at the intersection of macroeconomic factors, industry competition, and its own growth trajectory. Heightened short-term volatility may become the norm. What are your thoughts? Is this expectation management, or a signal of a demand inflection point? Share your bullish or bearish perspectives.",

      "selftext": "For someone who has always focused on diversification, I've gotten in deep with my latest venture. Before 2023, I fancied myself as quite the diversified investor, with most of my portfolio spread across ETFs, Tech stocks, Real-Estate, and Crypto. On paper, it looked responsible. I slept well. Then in 2023, I made a big life change, relocated, and decided to go all-in on building a company. My third. Fast forward to today, and my personal balance sheet looks completely different. What used to be a \\~$300k diversified portfolio is now mostly concentrated in one asset: my ownership equity in an operating fintech company. On paper, that stake is worth more than my old portfolio ever was (>$3m). In reality, my liquid position is now under 3% compared to 40% before my move. This bothers me. From one angle, this looks like rational concentration - founders are supposed to be concentrated in their highest-conviction asset right?. From another angle, it feels like I’ve traded financial resilience for theoretical upside. I’m “wealthier” on paper, but functionally much poorer in cash. So I’m curious how others here think about this from a pure investing perspective: • At what point does concentration in your own business stop being conviction and start being bad portfolio management? • How do you think about liquidity risk vs expected value when the asset is illiquid? • For those who’ve been through this, what did you wish you’d done earlier to rebalance or protect downside? Not looking for validation, genuinely interested in how others frame this trade-off. Am I overthinking it?",

      "selftext_processed": "For someone who has always focused on diversification Ive gotten in deep with my latest venture . Before 2023 I fancied myself as quite the diversified investor with most of my portfolio spread across ETFs Tech stocks RealEstate and Crypto . On paper it looked responsible . I slept well . Then in 2023 I made a big life change relocated and decided to go allin on building a company . My third . Fast forward to today and my personal balance sheet looks completely different . What used to be a $ 300k diversified portfolio is now mostly concentrated in one asset my ownership equity in an operating fintech company . On paper that stake is worth more than my old portfolio ever was $ 3m . In reality my liquid position is now under 3 % compared to 40 % before my move . This bothers me . From one angle this looks like rational concentration founders are supposed to be concentrated in their highestconviction asset right . From another angle it feels like I ’ ve traded financial resilience for theoretical upside . I ’ m “ wealthier ” on paper but functionally much poorer in cash . So I ’ m curious how others here think about this from a pure investing perspective • At what point does concentration in your own business stop being conviction and start being bad portfolio management • How do you think about liquidity risk vs expected value when the asset is illiquid • For those who ’ ve been through this what did you wish you ’ d done earlier to rebalance or protect downside Not_looking for validation genuinely interested in how others frame this tradeoff . Am I overthinking it"

      "selftext": "I recently shifted my focus away from the volatility of the Q2 earnings report and back to Nike's core: its products. After years of criticism for rehashing old designs, Nike's 2026 product line finally seems to be showcasing its R&D capabilities again. Three recent (or upcoming) key releases have changed my perspective: The \"Unleashed\" Year of the Horse Collection: Nike just released its 2026 Lunar New Year collection. The special editions of the G.T. Cut 4 and Ja 3 have already caused a huge sensation in the Asia-Pacific region. If they can leverage this to stabilize the Greater China market, it will be a huge support for the \"recovery logic.\" The \"Nike Mind\" Platform (launching January 2026): This is very cutting-edge. Nike is entering the \"neuroscience-based\" footwear field with the Mind 001 and 002. These shoes are designed to enhance \"sensory awareness helping athletes focus by stimulating the soles of their feet. This is a completely new category (Mind Science), and likely their response to the \"health/comfort\" trend pioneered by Hoka. 3D Printed Air Max 1000: The limited release of the AM1000 proves that Nike can still lead in technology. Seeing the high premium for the \"Oat\" colorway on the secondary market shows that \"brand heat\" hasn't disappeared, but rather that there was a lack of innovative supply previously. Investor Question: CEO Elliott Hill called 2026 a \"Win Now\" year. With North American wholesale business showing a 24% surge in the December 18th earnings report, are these new products enough to support building a long-term position below $65?",

After years of criticism for rehashing old designs Nikes 2026 product line finally seems to be showcasing its RD capabilities again . Three recent or upcoming key releases have changed my perspective The Unleashed Year of the Horse Collection Nike just released its 2026 Lunar New Year collection . The special editions of the G.T . Cut 4 and Ja 3 have already caused a huge sensation in the AsiaPacific region . If they can leverage this to stabilize the Greater China market it will be a huge support for the recovery logic . The Nike Mind Platform launching January 2026 This is very cuttingedge . Nike is entering the neurosciencebased footwear field with the Mind 001 and 002 . These shoes are designed to enhance sensory awareness helping athletes focus by stimulating the soles of their feet . This is a completely new category Mind Science and likely their response to the healthcomfort trend pioneered by Hoka . 3D Printed Air Max 1000 The limited release of the AM1000 proves that Nike can still lead in technology . Seeing the high premium for the Oat colorway on the secondary market shows that brand heat hasnt disappeared but rather that there was a lack of innovative supply previously . Investor Question CEO Elliott Hill called 2026 a Win Now year . With North American wholesale business showing a 24 % surge in the December 18th earnings report are these new products enough to support building a longterm position below $ 65"

      "selftext": "Yesterday, I made a post in the community discussing the recent AI tech boom and also shared my thoughts on Intel (INTC) as a stock. A lot of people responded that they’re not optimistic about INTC and think it can’t really compare to TSM or NVIDIA (NVDA). Admittedly, in some respects, Intel isn’t on the same level as those two companies right now. However, I personally believe that INTC still has some short term investment value, and today’s rally kind of proved my point. I’ve always felt that a stock’s price movement isn’t determined solely by macro news things like capital flows and market trends are also important factors to consider in our research. So I’m really curious when you’re deciding whether a stock is worth investing in, what aspects do you usually pay attention to? What are your standards and methods for evaluating a stock? I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts!",

A lot of people responded that they ’ re not_optimistic about INTC and think it can ’ t really compare to TSM or NVIDIA NVDA . Admittedly in some respects Intel isn ’ t on the same level as those two companies right now . However I personally believe that INTC still has some short term investment value and today ’ s rally kind of proved my point . I ’ ve always felt that a stock ’ s price movement isn ’ t determined solely by macro news things like capital flows and market trends are also important factors to consider in our research . So I ’ m really curious when you ’ re deciding whether a stock is worth investing in what aspects do you usually pay attention to What are your standards and methods for evaluating a stock I ’ d love to hear everyone ’ s thoughts"

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, Wishing you all a lot of professional, personal and financial success, and a happy 2026. Influenced by some Reddit users here, I recently started using GetQuin (free version). However, I must admit I find the platform quite complex. I first tried to manually recreate my three stock portfolios, which were built over the course of this year starting from an initial deposit. After that, I imported my transactions from XTB, which actually worked fine. That said, I noticed that the results were not offset against the initial portfolio balance and instead seemed to duplicate the values, which left me a bit confused. Overall, I got the feeling that the platform largely exceeds my actual needs. What I’m looking for is something simpler, excluding Google Finance / Yahoo Finance (and similar tools), that allows me to: Track the performance of each of my portfolios (stocks, fixed-term deposits, and investment funds) And, in particular: Access detailed information on each individual stock Analyse my portfolio by sector and currency Track dividends, namely: payment dates ex-dividend dates expected/forecast dividends For dividend tracking specifically, I was considering starting to use Track Your Dividends, but ideally I’d like to have everything consolidated in a single platform. Do you have any recommendations for platforms that offer both a mobile app and a browser version, preferably free? Thanks in advance!",

I'm watching them very closely in these final trading days of 2025 as I may buy in, expecting an increase as end of year tax selling comes to an end. **GIS** \\- General Mills. Food stocks in general have been in a tough environment. GIS has been in a downward trend for over a year. Current SP: $46.75. 52-wk range: 45.15 - 67.35. They pay a solid dividend of 5.2% Would be a LT hold for me if I can get it on sale in the next day or 2. That one meme stock that isn't always welcomed here. Has been in a steady decline the past couple weeks as retail has tax-loss harvested. Just above it's 52-wk low. Would be a ST hold if I can get in on sale. Not one I want to chase. **HRZN** \\- Horizon Technology Finance - my long-term high yielding stock. It's had some mis-steps the past couple years and has been trending back down towards a 52-week low. Current SP: $6.34. 52-wk range: 5.71 - 10.00 Would probably be a ST hold if it pops. Would love to know of any stocks you're specifically watching!",

They pay a solid dividend of 5.2 % Would be a LT hold for me if I can get it on sale in the next day or 2 . That one meme stock that isnt always welcomed here .

      "selftext": "In 1964, Buffett acquired Berkshire Hathaway at $7.50 per share, which means that at roughly $756,000 per share (Class A common), it has grown its market price at roughly 20% compounded annually, approximately double the CAGR of the S&P index over the same period. EDIT: Perhaps more impressive is that, using data tracked through 2018, Berkshire's per share tangible book value compounded similarly at 18.7% annualized. No other company has so consistently tracked so closely between its per share tangible book and market price for 61 years. Buffett changed my life in two ways: First, his 1984 article in Hermes, the Columbia Business School paper, \"[The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville](\" introduced me to the writings of Ben Graham and David Dodd, and completely changed my capital allocation/investment management strategy. Second, [this talk]( given to a group of Florida University MBA candidates, specifically the introduction in which he discusses the importance of integrity. I am confident in Greg Abel's abilities and in my fellow Berkshire shareholders' ability to continue holding Berkshire management to Ben Graham's four key criteria, which I can recite from memory to this day: *An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.*",

The cleanest example is the 28-year microgrid PPA with Topanga Terrace, where the company says it will design, build, own, and operate an on-site system combining solar, battery storage, and gas backup. One coverage summary notes a 2% annual escalator and a company model estimating about $3.85M in gross revenue over the contract term. Then came the A123 MOU, focused on deploying 20-foot 5 MWh storage units across projects. Even if you treat MOUs cautiously, it is a practical de-risking step for a business where storage is a gating component. What makes this more interesting is that short interest has been rising. MarketBeat shows about 4.43M shares sold short as of Dec 15, 2025, roughly 10.66% of the public float, with days to cover around 1.7 NFA",

The cleanest example is the 28year microgrid PPA with Topanga Terrace where the company says it will design build own and operate an onsite system combining solar battery storage and gas backup . One coverage summary notes a 2 % annual escalator and a company model estimating about $ 3.85M in gross revenue over the contract term . Then came the A123 MOU focused on deploying 20foot 5 MWh storage units across projects . Even if you treat MOUs cautiously it is a practical derisking step for a business where storage is a gating component . What makes this more interesting is that short interest has been rising . MarketBeat shows about 4.43M shares sold short as of Dec 15 2025 roughly 10.66 % of the public float with days to cover around 1.7 NFA"

      "selftext": "Disclaimer: This was prepared with the help of a Korean associate. Later we fed it in to AI for translation and formatting purposes. TL;DR: CPNG only trades in the U.S., but the crisis is entirely in Korea: lawmakers are talking perjury and suspension, the public is actively boycotting, and this is a newly profitable, logistics-heavy business that cannot survive disruption. U.S. investors are pricing a PR issue; Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure. Coupang is fuk This needs to be viewed as a Korean political and legitimacy crisis, not a U.S. tech stock hiccup — and Korean senators explicitly said that today. At the National Assembly hearing, lawmakers directly addressed the gap between how this crisis is reported in Korea versus how it’s framed in U.S. outlets. Domestically, investigators are disputing Coupang’s disclosures, challenging sworn testimony, and raising perjury accusations. Internationally, it’s still framed as a data breach plus compensation. Senators openly questioned why foreign investors are seeing a materially softer narrative, and several explicitly warned that this information gap itself is becoming part of the problem. That matters even more because Coupang only trades in the U.S. The Korean platform is owned by a Delaware holding company listed on the NYSE. There is no Korean stock price to reflect domestic outrage, no local shareholder pressure, and no market release valve. All price discovery happens in the U.S., while all political, regulatory, and consumer pressure is happening inside Korea. Lawmakers are clearly aware of this and unhappy about it. On the ground, public reaction is not abstract. Lawmakers, civic groups, and labor organizations are openly calling for operational suspension, not just fines or apologies. Korean media coverage has shifted from “breach response” to “whether the company should be allowed to continue operating in its current form.” At the consumer level, large-scale boycott behavior (“탈팡”) is observable, with app-usage trackers and business press reporting declines in daily active users while competitors gained share. In Korea, boycotts are not symbolic — people actually leave platforms, especially when alternatives exist. This is existential for Coupang because of its structure. The company only recently became profitable, after years of losses. It is a logistics-heavy business with thin margins that depends on uninterrupted volume, dense routing, and habit-driven repeat usage. A sustained boycott or even a temporary suspension would immediately reverse profitability. Drivers leave. Sellers leave. Customers retrain behavior. This is not a business you can pause and restart. Two weeks ago, Coupang installed a U.S.-trained American lawyer as CEO to front the crisis. Domestically, that has been widely interpreted as insulating decision-makers behind U.S. legal optics rather than accepting Korean accountability. That perception has worsened public anger and reinforced the political narrative that the company is evading responsibility rather than confronting it. This is why this trade is no longer about valuation, multiples, or growth trajectories. It’s about whether a newly profitable, logistics-dependent company — openly boycotted, politically isolated, under criminal scrutiny, and facing calls for suspension — can survive in a country that actually follows through on public and state pressure. Even if it was about fundamentals they are shit anyways. U.S. markets are pricing a bad news cycle. Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure. That disconnect is the thesis.

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This was prepared with the help of a Korean associate . Later we fed it in to AI for translation and formatting purposes . TLDR CPNG only trades in the U.S. but the crisis is entirely in Korea lawmakers are talking perjury and suspension the public is actively boycotting and this is a newly profitable logisticsheavy business that can not survive disruption . U.S. investors are pricing a PR issue Korea is treating this as a companyending legitimacy failure . Coupang is fuk This needs to be viewed as a Korean political and legitimacy crisis not_a U.S. tech stock hiccup — and Korean senators explicitly said that today . At the National Assembly hearing lawmakers directly addressed the gap between how this crisis is reported in Korea versus how it ’ s framed in U.S. outlets . Domestically investigators are disputing Coupang ’ s disclosures challenging sworn testimony and raising perjury accusations . Internationally it ’ s still framed as a data breach plus compensation . Senators openly questioned why foreign investors are seeing a materially softer narrative and several explicitly warned that this information gap itself is becoming part of the problem . That matters even more because Coupang only trades in the U.S . The Korean platform is owned by a Delaware holding company listed on the NYSE . There is no_Korean stock price to reflect domestic outrage no_local shareholder pressure and no_market release valve . All price discovery happens in the U.S. while all political regulatory and consumer pressure is happening inside Korea . Lawmakers are clearly aware of this and unhappy about it . On the ground public reaction is not_abstract . Lawmakers civic groups and labor organizations are openly calling for operational suspension not_just fines or apologies . Korean media coverage has shifted from “ breach response ” to “ whether the company should be allowed to continue operating in its current form. ” At the consumer level largescale boycott behavior “ 탈팡 ” is observable with appusage trackers and business press reporting declines in daily active users while competitors gained share . In Korea boycotts are not_symbolic — people actually leave platforms especially when alternatives exist . This is existential for Coupang because of its structure . The company only recently became profitable after years of losses . It is a logisticsheavy business with thin margins that depends on uninterrupted volume dense routing and habitdriven repeat usage . A sustained boycott or even a temporary suspension would immediately reverse profitability . Drivers leave . Sellers leave . Customers retrain behavior . This is not_a business you can pause and restart . Two weeks ago Coupang installed a U.S.trained American lawyer as CEO to front the crisis . Domestically that has been widely interpreted as insulating decisionmakers behind U.S. legal optics rather than accepting Korean accountability . That perception has worsened public anger and reinforced the political narrative that the company is evading responsibility rather than confronting it . This is why this trade is no_longer about valuation multiples or growth trajectories . It ’ s about whether a newly profitable logisticsdependent company — openly boycotted politically isolated under criminal scrutiny and facing calls for suspension — can survive in a country that actually follows through on public and state pressure . Even if it was about fundamentals they are shit anyways . U.S. markets are pricing a bad news cycle . Korea is treating this as a companyending legitimacy failure . That disconnect is the thesis .

      "selftext": "I’ve been reading a lot of threads here, and a big portion of the discussion seems to revolve around headlines/news and “what do I do now?” That made me think about a question we rarely ask directly: What is a stock, in practice? It’s not the news. It’s a price that reflects collective expectations about future cash flows, risk, and sentiment and those expectations update continuously. News can absolutely matter, but reacting to headlines alone often isn’t a repeatable approach because: information is frequently priced quickly, the interpretation (and what’s already expected) matters more than the headline, and results are often dominated by process rather than “having the right info.” Where I’ve seen the biggest difference is having a clear framework that answers: Thesis: what do I believe and what would change my mind? Valuation / expectations: what needs to go right for this price to be justified? Time horizon: is this a 3-month view or a 3 year view? Risk: what’s the downside case and how do I avoid a permanent loss? Position sizing: even if I’m wrong, can I stay in the game? I’m not claiming this is the only way to think about it just sharing a lens that helps me separate noise from signal. Question for the community: When a big news item hits, what determines whether you change your thesis versus do nothing? What’s your decision rule?",

It's clear they believe in the long-term potential, and their actions speak louder than words. Nike’s brand still holds its ground globally, maintaining a leading position in the market. The North American market is showing signs of recovery, and despite a 26% drop in share price, Nike remains one of the most iconic brands in the world. The current price drop has undoubtedly caught the attention of value investors. With a more attractive valuation, Nike is starting to look like a compelling opportunity, especially for those who believe in the company’s future growth prospects. The question remains: is this a temporary dip or the start of a larger opportunity? Only time will tell, but with insider confidence and global brand strength, it might be a good time to consider adding Nike to your watchlist.",

Its clear they believe in the longterm potential and their actions speak louder than words . Nike ’ s brand still holds its ground globally maintaining a leading position in the market . The North American market is showing signs of recovery and despite a 26 % drop in share price Nike remains one of the most iconic brands in the world . The current price drop has undoubtedly caught the attention of value investors . With a more attractive valuation Nike is starting to look like a compelling opportunity especially for those who believe in the company ’ s future growth prospects . The question remains is this a temporary dip or the start of a larger opportunity Only time will tell but with insider confidence and global brand strength it might be a good time to consider adding Nike to your watchlist ."

      "selftext": "NKE is hovering around $60-$61 today. I've been stuck in this position for a long time (down about 20% year to date), and this stock feels dead completely stagnant. The recently released Q2 earnings report did beat expectations (EPS $0.53 vs. $0.37 forecast), which is somewhat comforting. However, the profit margin guidance and weakness in the Chinese market still look pretty grim. The only reason I haven't sold or done a Cover Call yet is because I saw Tim Cook bought about $3 million worth of shares last week. If insiders like him are adding positions at this price, does that mean the bottom is finally in? Or is this just a classic value trap? While the 2.7% dividend is decent, it doesn't come close to covering the principal loss. Do you believe in the turnaround story for 2026? Or do you think Hoka and On are still stealing their market share? Position: 620 shares, average cost $78. What would you do?",

      "selftext": "Coinbase trades pretty in line with Bitcoin so you can see it’s down in the last year. Bitcoin is EXPECTED to bottom in ‘26, whether it actually does or drags longer is another story. Coinbase is also expanding to tokenized stock trading and also using Kalshi for the prediction markets. While I think those two things help them drive additional earnings, I do think the outlook on crypto (especially BTC) is going to weigh more heavily on how this company performs next year than the added lines of business. At least, that’s how I believe the market will overwhelmingly choose to trade the company on. In other words, my assumption is that the stock trading and prediction markets is a nice sweetener but doesn’t change the story (already would face fiercer competition from Robinhood on stuff like this). So given all of this, coupled with the lower PE, (20x) versus others in the industry and assuming BTC will follow a standard cycle and hit a low in the coming is there really any other reason not to buy sometime in the coming year? Holding for a few years at this point seems like it would yield a decent return",

The market's core logic surrounding it still revolves around: AI memory demand, data center expansion, and tight HBM supply these are indeed genuine long-term drivers. My personal perspective: MU currently exhibits distinct characteristics: Solid fundamental logic, not purely a sentiment-driven narrative Continued support at elevated levels, with no significant capital outflow However, divergence is growing, and sentiment is less one-sided than before Therefore, in my view: It possesses the core of a trend while entering a phase requiring validation. Moving forward, focus should shift to earnings delivery, order momentum, and industry pricing trends rather than relying solely on imagination. For MU today, the question is no longer simply “will it rise?” Rather, it's whether the logic behind its ascent can be sustained.

I’m mainly curious how people here are thinking about AMD going into 2026. On the bullish side, AMD seems to be gaining more traction in data center and AI, and they are still taking market share from Intel. Lisa Su has also built a lot of trust over the years when it comes to execution. On the other hand, the stock has already run up quite a bit and competition in AI, especially from Nvidia, is intense. Valuation is also something I’m not fully sure about at these levels. For those who follow AMD closely, do you think the growth story still has room to play out in 2026? Or do you feel most of the good news is already priced in? Not looking for financial advice, just want to hear different perspectives from long term holders and skeptics. Thanks",

      "selftext": "I’ve been running a stock trading strategy for the past 4 months and wanted to hear how more experienced people would approach monetizing something like this. The principals are: medium-term trades (avg 20 days), avg 8 concurrent trades, diversified - out of 100 monitored stocks 47 stocks were traded in the 4 month period. Results so far (live trading): * 89 closed trades (1-2 trades a day) * 75% win rate * average trade return +3.1% * profit factor ~5.1 * max drawdown ~1.7% * Sharpe ~3.6. I’m aware that 4 months is not statistically sufficient to claim anything, but given these constraints, I’m curious how experienced traders/investors would think about next steps: continue trading personal capital? (I don't have nearly enough personal wealth, even if this strategy persists - which will double the invested capital each year, the initial capital I can invest right now is way too small to gain something meaningful in the near term). Perhaps trading with leverage can solve this? focus on building a longer live track record? But how much is enough? half a year? a full year? 3 years? By then I might lose the edge I have. position it as research/consulting rather than a trading product? I'm already working on the next iteration monitoring additional companies which will improve performance, but this takes time and effort, and I don't want to wait until it's \"perfect\" rather I'd start now when it's \"good enough\". Also, developing this takes too much time to go along with a full time job, so I need to decide whether to continue developing this or to use the current version as is and abandon any further development. Let me know if you have any critical feedback especially on what you’d want to see before taking something like this seriously. ps - I also add a figure of the capital increase compared to several indices from the last 4 months in the comments.",

Results so far live trading 89 closed trades 12 trades a day 75 % win rate average trade return 3.1 % profit factor 5.1 max drawdown 1.7 % Sharpe 3.6 . I ’ m aware that 4 months is not_statistically sufficient to claim anything but given these constraints I ’ m curious how experienced tradersinvestors would think about next steps continue trading personal capital I dont have nearly enough personal wealth even if this strategy persists which will double the invested capital each year the initial capital I can invest right now is way too small to gain something meaningful in the near term . Perhaps trading with leverage can solve this focus on building a longer live track record But how much is enough half a year a full year 3 years By then I might lose the edge I have . position it as researchconsulting rather than a trading product Im already working on the next iteration monitoring additional companies which will improve performance but this takes time and effort and I dont want to wait until its perfect rather Id start now when its good enough .

Took 500 to 90k within a month and ended up losing every penny of it (EDIT: THE LOSS PORN IS NOT ABOUT THE $500, but the 90k I peaked at) and now have pretty much nothing to my name. I still have my tech job, but there’s a pretty high chance I’m gonna get laid off soon even if it hasn’t happened yet. Completely lonely in my personal life with no real friends and a non existent dating life. My entire world is crumbling before me and losing all this money is just the final gut punch. If I could give any advice to anyone out there, just don’t trade options. They will ruin your life. Look, I’m not completely giving up yet even though I’m undoubtedly at a very difficult point, but I hope I’ve been able to prevent someone else from having their life ruined by options. Guess I genuinely might have to work at Wendy’s soon. EDIT: I know that I technically only lost $500, but what hurts is that I nearly touched 100k, actually money that I could’ve withdrawn, before falling back to $0. There is no way to mentally see this as just a $500 loss. Trust me I would not be making lost porn posts if I just went straight from $500 to $0. By this logic every dollar gained since birth is funny money because you technically began at $0.",

      "selftext": "I know reddit is evangelical about index investing so before everyone seethes most of my holdings are HSBC FTSE All-World Index Fund Accumulation C (not investment advice) but I am curious about steel-manning active management. I know this sub likes passive investing because of the statement above, fees, etc. But a question I have always had is what does the above statistic include? For example, Ben Felix has a video about how the rebalancing of indexes makes you overpay and undersell for IPOs and delistings etc as they are forced by their definition to adjust for those details which is one thing an active manager can avoid. Some funds mandate themselves with targeted returns of e.g. 7% for less volatility or contain bonds or are target-date funds (retirement) so almost by construction will lose to the market but aren't designed for that purpose. Also a lot of funds measure their return as risk-adjusted rather than purely annualised so net of fees I suppose it is conceivable a number of them would beat say, an all world index, after accounting for that and fees? The all-world index (and US even more so) is now also heavily weighted to mag 7 - in theory if an active manager comes close to that net of fees with a wider distribution of stocks then to me that seems a reasonable diversification argument for active management. Holding 10,000 stock in a global market tracker is also not really true diversification as the weightings of the index would matter - meaningful diversification is achieved by reducing the correlation between the holdings except for at the tail-end where owning 5 banks is better than 1 because the 1 could be lehman, but you would expect an active manager to account for more than that with markowitz optimisation for their allocation %s etc I am curious is there anything anywhere that compares apples to apples of 100% equity return maximisers against the index net of fees? Does the table tilt towards active management the more people invest in indexes as presumably this opens up relative value opportunities for active funds? Any other considerations?",

I know this sub likes passive investing because of the statement above fees etc . But a question I have always had is what does the above statistic include For example Ben Felix has a video about how the rebalancing of indexes makes you overpay and undersell for IPOs and delistings etc as they are forced by their definition to adjust for those details which is one thing an active manager can avoid . Some funds mandate themselves with targeted returns of e.g . 7 % for less volatility or contain bonds or are targetdate funds retirement so almost by construction will lose to the market but arent designed for that purpose . Also a lot of funds measure their return as riskadjusted rather than purely annualised so net of fees I suppose it is conceivable a number of them would beat say an all world index after accounting for that and fees The allworld index and US even more so is now also heavily weighted to mag 7 in theory if an active manager comes close to that net of fees with a wider distribution of stocks then to me that seems a reasonable diversification argument for active management . Holding 10000 stock in a global market tracker is also not_really true diversification as the weightings of the index would matter meaningful diversification is achieved by reducing the correlation between the holdings except for at the tailend where owning 5 banks is better than 1 because the 1 could be lehman but you would expect an active manager to account for more than that with markowitz optimisation for their allocation % s etc I am curious is there anything anywhere that compares apples to apples of 100 % equity return maximisers against the index net of fees Does the table tilt towards active management the more people invest in indexes as presumably this opens up relative value opportunities for active funds Any other considerations"

      "title": "Conversation on Howard Marks' Memo - \"Is [AI] a Bubble?\"",
      "selftext": "I read Howard Marks' memo addressing the widely discussed \"AI Bubble.\" As a novice, still early in developing a deeper technical understanding of AI, I found it insightful not because it dismisses the idea of a bubble outright, but because it reframes what kind of bubble we may be in - an important distinction with materially different implications for investors and the broader economy. *For those that read Marks' memo, curious if you had a different takeaway....* While I believe we are in a bubble, the more nuanced and critical questions we should ask is whether this is a mean-reverting bubble (net negative for the economy) or an inflection bubble (net positive despite poor aggregate investor returns). * Mean-Reverting Bubbles * These are financial fads driven by the promise of returns without risk, offering little or no lasting benefit to productivity or human progress. The capital is misallocated, leverage compounds fragility, and the unwind leaves the real economy worse off. * Example: The subprime mortgage-backed securities crisis leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. * Inflection Bubbles * These bubbles compress decades of innovation into a few short years. While vast amounts of capital are destroyed, a meaningful portion is still invested in technologies that permanently reshape the economy. * Example: The dot-com bubble, which accelerated internet infrastructure, normalized online consumer behavior, funded logistics, warehousing, and software systems long before they were profitable. * Amazon is the perfect example, a company that nearly failed, but who survival relied on the oversaturated capital markets willing to fund years of losses in pursuit of scale. **Applying this Framework to the AI Era** Marks argues that AI increasingly resembles an inflection bubble, but one where many of the most important questions remain unanswered: 1. Who will ultimately be the winners? 1. History is unkind to early entrants. There were once thousands of automobile companies; only a handful survive today. AI will likely follow a similar pattern. 2. Will AI generate profits, and for whom? 1. Today, many AI services reportedly lose money on each query. The open question is whether companies will tolerate sustained losses to gain market share, and whether durable pricing power eventually emerges. 2. Sam Altman stated: \"We'll build this sort of generally intelligent system and then ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return from it.\" 3. Will AI meaningfully expand margins or revenues for users? 1. AI is clearly a productive tool, but productivity gains do not automatically translate into profits. Will costs savings accrue to companies or be competed away? 4. Should we worry about \"circular deals\"? 1. Marks highlights an important historical parallel to the telecom boom of the late 1990s, when fiber-owning companies sold capacity to one another, allowing both sides to report revenue without creating true economic value. 2. Today, (i) OpenAI reportedly committed \\~$1.4T to counterparties despite not yet being profitable, and (ii) Goldman Sachs estimates that \\~15% of Nvidia’s future revenue may come from such circular arrangements. 3. This all raises questions about how much reported growth reflects genuine end-demand versus financial engineering. **AI Financing Structures, and Looming Debt Issues** JPMorgan analysts estimate the AI infrastructure build-out could ultimately cost approx. $5T, while the largest spenders (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle) collectively hold only \\~$350B in cash. This gap has encouraged increasingly aggressive financing structures. I believe we may be approaching a point where credit expansion has exhausted its “good projects” and is beginning to fund marginal ones. Meta and Blue Owl notably entered a data center partnership, where they structured an SPV so the debt would not sit on Meta's balance sheet. This shifts accounting risk; however, it does not eliminate economic exposure. The structure echoes earlier SPV arrangements used by Enron, where operating control existed without consolidation, and leverage sat outside the partner company's financials. Debt itself is not inherently problematic, instead the risk lies in whether capital is being allocated to projects with long-term economic value and whether lenders have clarity on who bears residual value risk when loans mature. **Takeaway: Are We in an AI Bubble?** I think it's fair to say that AI will be a source of extraordinary change, but most of us have little clarity on what it will ultimately do, how it will be monetized, or the timeline over which returns actually materialize. As is said, \"history rhymes\" and is often instructive. Look at how radio and aviation transformed society in the early 1900s, yet their stocks fell 97% and 96%, respectively, from peak to trough (period covering late 1920s through early 1930s). While these stocks were alongside a broader speculative collapse across nearly all asset classes, it is important context. Going in favor of AI, is that it already has products with over a billion active users; leading players are established companies with revenue, cash flow, and some profits; and valuations remain elevated but are meaningfully below prior bubble extremes. Given the scale and intensity of capital being deployed today, it is hard to argue AI will not drive real productivity gains and long-term economic benefits. What I find far less convincing is the aggregate return on invest capital justifying the capital invested. If we assume \\~$1T in invested capital in AI-related capex and infrastructure, achieving a 20% return requires generating 3-6x that amount in cumulative gross profit over a 5-10 year period; not revenue, but distributable cash flow. Once we account for failed projects, overbuilt infrastructure, and the concentration of value among a small number of winners, the burden falls on the winners (assuming Nvidia, Google, and a handful of others) to generate true economic surplus becomes enormous. In short: I believe AI is an inflection bubble, one where society benefits from its inventions and productivity, but also one where many investors will not earn the returns they anticipate, and where capital discipline will matter far more than technological promises.

      "selftext_processed": "I read Howard Marks memo addressing the widely discussed AI Bubble . As a novice still early in developing a deeper technical understanding of AI I found it insightful not_because it dismisses the idea of a bubble outright but because it reframes what kind of bubble we may be in an important distinction with materially different implications for investors and the broader economy . For those that read Marks memo curious if you had a different takeaway .... While I believe we are in a bubble the more nuanced and critical questions we should ask is whether this is a meanreverting bubble net negative for the economy or an inflection bubble net positive despite poor aggregate investor returns . MeanReverting Bubbles These are financial fads driven by the promise of returns without risk offering little or no_lasting benefit to productivity or human progress . The capital is misallocated leverage compounds fragility and the unwind leaves the real economy worse off . Example The subprime mortgagebacked securities crisis leading up to the 2008 financial crisis . Inflection Bubbles These bubbles compress decades of innovation into a few short years . While vast amounts of capital are destroyed a meaningful portion is still invested in technologies that permanently reshape the economy . Example The dotcom bubble which accelerated internet infrastructure normalized online consumer behavior funded logistics warehousing and software systems long before they were profitable . Amazon is the perfect example a company that nearly failed but who survival relied on the oversaturated capital markets willing to fund years of losses in pursuit of scale . Applying this Framework to the AI Era Marks argues that AI increasingly resembles an inflection bubble but one where many of the most important questions remain unanswered 1. Who will ultimately be the winners 1 . History is unkind to early entrants . There were once thousands of automobile companies only a handful survive today . AI will likely follow a similar pattern . 2 . Will AI generate profits and for whom 1 . Today many AI services reportedly lose money on each query . The open question is whether companies will tolerate sustained losses to gain market share and whether durable pricing power eventually emerges . 2 . Sam Altman stated Well build this sort of generally intelligent system and then ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return from it . 3 . Will AI meaningfully expand margins or revenues for users 1 . AI is clearly a productive tool but productivity gains do not_automatically translate into profits . Will costs savings accrue to companies or be competed away 4 . Should we worry about circular deals 1 . Marks highlights an important historical parallel to the telecom boom of the late 1990s when fiberowning companies sold capacity to one another allowing both sides to report revenue without creating true economic value . 2 . Today i OpenAI reportedly committed $ 1.4T to counterparties despite not_yet being profitable and ii Goldman Sachs estimates that 15 % of Nvidia ’ s future revenue may come from such circular arrangements . 3 . This all raises questions about how much reported growth reflects genuine enddemand versus financial engineering . AI Financing Structures and Looming Debt Issues JPMorgan analysts estimate the AI infrastructure buildout could ultimately cost approx . $ 5T while the largest spenders Microsoft Alphabet Amazon Meta and Oracle collectively hold only $ 350B in cash . This gap has encouraged increasingly aggressive financing structures . I believe we may be approaching a point where credit expansion has exhausted its “ good projects ” and is beginning to fund marginal ones . Meta and Blue Owl notably entered a data center partnership where they structured an SPV so the debt would not_sit on Metas balance sheet . This shifts accounting risk however it does not_eliminate economic exposure . The structure echoes earlier SPV arrangements used by Enron where operating control existed without consolidation and leverage sat outside the partner companys financials . Debt itself is not_inherently problematic instead the risk lies in whether capital is being allocated to projects with longterm economic value and whether lenders have clarity on who bears residual value risk when loans mature . Takeaway Are We in an AI Bubble I think its fair to say that AI will be a source of extraordinary change but most of us have little clarity on what it will ultimately do how it will be monetized or the timeline over which returns actually materialize . As is said history rhymes and is often instructive . Look at how radio and aviation transformed society in the early 1900s yet their stocks fell 97 % and 96 % respectively from peak to trough period covering late 1920s through early 1930s . While these stocks were alongside a broader speculative collapse across nearly all asset classes it is important context . Going in favor of AI is that it already has products with over a billion active users leading players are established companies with revenue cash flow and some profits and valuations remain elevated but are meaningfully below prior bubble extremes . Given the scale and intensity of capital being deployed today it is hard to argue AI will not_drive real productivity gains and longterm economic benefits . What I find far less convincing is the aggregate return on invest capital justifying the capital invested . If we assume $ 1T in invested capital in AIrelated capex and infrastructure achieving a 20 % return requires generating 36x that amount in cumulative gross profit over a 510 year period not_revenue but distributable cash flow . Once we account for failed projects overbuilt infrastructure and the concentration of value among a small number of winners the burden falls on the winners assuming Nvidia Google and a handful of others to generate true economic surplus becomes enormous . In short I believe AI is an inflection bubble one where society benefits from its inventions and productivity but also one where many investors will not_earn the returns they anticipate and where capital discipline will matter far more than technological promises ."

Should I just dump the sum into that Or make some oneoff stock purchases Or do something completely different Obviously this is a very small amount in investment terms but surely there must be something worthwhile I can do with it Thanks in advance for any tips ."

      "selftext": "Opinion: Symbotic’s future growth valuation is not taking into account its 35% stake in Green Box, an AI warehouse as a service business. Currently Symbotic is viewed as a pure play robotics company, simply supplying its AI robotics system to companies such as Walmart and Target. Symbotic’s AI robotics system is the only rival to Amazon’s system, which has been proven to be a game changer and the key to unlocking fast and accurate order fulfilment when 1000s of SKUs are available. If companies want to compete with Amazon, they will need Symbotic’s systems and this is what we are seeing with Walmart, Target and recently Medline. This is already well known and baked into the company valuation, with the company trading at just under 16 x revenue. What I believe is not factored in is the warehouse as a service market and their unique opportunity to capture a huge share of this through Green Box, their joint venture with Soft Bank to provide multi tenant warehousing services fit out with their custom AI robotics systems. Quick maths show that the WaaS market was $12 billion USD growing at 15% per year, giving a value of $25 billion USD in 2028. If Green Box can capture 35% market share (first Green Box locations go live 2026) that is revenue of $3.06 billion. Current robotics sales forecast is $4.16 billion in 2028 (massive >$22 billion back log) so that would be a total revenue of $7.22 billion USD. Multiply by current Market Cap/Revenue ratio of 15.8 and divide by share count and that gives a share value of $189 using just US market alone. Now, if you take this and apply it to the total international WaaS market with an estimated TAM of $2.69 trillion USD in 2030 and estimate that Symbotic can capture just 1%, we get a share price of $256 (assuming it is trading at 10 x revenue) accounting for only $6 billion in revenue from robotic system sales. Obviously this would be way higher so conservatively we could say $300 - $400 per share. I believe massive share dilution is not a huge risk as Soft Bank is financing the Green Box venture. Obviously stock based compensation could be an issue but people said that about PLTR when it was a >$20 stock and now look at it. To be fair I am probably a bit early with my revenue predictions as it take a couple years to build out a Green Box site and start recognising revenue, so I am accumulating shares, but might grab some calls should there be a large drop for end of 2026 when the first revenue from Green Box is recognised.",

Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Tickers: BBABA + 5.03% PDD + 4.94% FXI + 2.55% ASHR + 1.14% UUP + 0.69% 4) There are fake, untrue, and probably illegal rumors and/or statements made by, perhaps, market manipulators or short sellers, that I am interested in selling shares of Truth. THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SELLING! I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements, and who may have done so in the past, be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities. Truth is an important part of our historic win, and I deeply believe in it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Ticker: DJT + 4.18% 5) I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States. These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country. We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico. I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a “deal” between our two Countries. Ticker: EWW + 3.40% I’ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon. Let me know if you're intersted in any stats I can pull for you. If more people are interested I’ll do a detailed write-up of the analysis.

I compared the price 1 minute after the post and then 45 minutes later . Here ’ s the 5 posts with the biggest bullish impact 1 The famous U.S. Steel partnership post . Its pretty long so heres the link . Affected ticker X 13.48 % 2 I am pleased to announce that Bill Pulte will serve as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency . Bill needs no_formal introduction to the Great Citizens of our Country because they have seen and many have experienced his philanthropy firsthand . He believes in the incredible potential of our Nation and will help us restore the American Dream FOR ALL . Congratulations Bill Tickers FNMA 5.64 % FMCC 3.70 % 3 Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World ’ s Markets I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 % effective immediately . At some point hopefully in the near future China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A. and other Countries is no_longer sustainable or acceptable . Conversely and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States including the Departments of Commerce Treasury and the USTR to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade Trade Barriers Tariffs Currency Manipulation and Non Monetary Tariffs and that these Countries have not_at my strong suggestion retaliated in any way shape or form against the United States I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period of 10 % also effective immediately . Thank you for your attention to this matter Tickers BBABA 5.03 % PDD 4.94 % FXI 2.55 % ASHR 1.14 % UUP 0.69 % 4 There are fake untrue and probably illegal rumors andor statements made by perhaps market manipulators or short sellers that I am interested in selling shares of Truth . THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE . I HAVE NO_INTENTION OF SELLING I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements and who may have done so in the past be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities . Truth is an important part of our historic win and I deeply believe in it . Thank you for your attention to this matter . MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Ticker DJT 4.18 % 5 I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico . It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States . These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal migrants into our Country . We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and highlevel Representatives of Mexico . I look forward to participating in those negotiations with President Sheinbaum as we attempt to achieve a “ deal ” between our two Countries . Ticker EWW 3.40 % I ’ ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon . Let me know if youre intersted in any stats I can pull for you . If more people are interested I ’ ll do a detailed writeup of the analysis ."

I know that’s a pretty hard question to ask as it’s based on markets but people have said anything under 5 years for a stocks and shares ISA is pointless?",

      "selftext": "Firstly, let me say I hate these over-done posts as much as the next person hah, but I did want to offer my insights as a 20+ year investor with both a long portfolio and an options portfolio that I generate a living income off of. My long portfolio is currently 100% SGOV. Without overanalyzing or cherry picking, the simplest historic indicators show that market valuations right now are extremely rich, of the type that always proceeds a major correction. Shiller PE nearing dot-com levels: [ Trailing PE highest on record: [ Forward PE at a ceiling it only surpasses during major market crises: [ On top of that you have a flight to safety, gold, and a flight from risk, bitcoin, rounding out 2025 narratives. However, despite this, I'm not actually bearish for 2026. There will be an come-uppance, we all know this, but I can see 2026 melting up another 5-10%. This is because the single most influential variable the market has responded to in the last 15 years is liquidity, and apparently the biggest source of liquidity isn't jobs or GDP, but interest rates. This has driven the Main St vs. Wall St divide since 2008. Now the US has an administration that is hell bent on lowering interest rates, regardless of any orthodox impetus to do this. Trump will be appointing a new Fed chair, and possibly more members, who will basically vote how he says. Not only that, but I could see this new chair making statements during any moderate 10% market correction that support QE and rescuing the market, meaning almost any red month will be a buy-the-dip type situation. We also have a pending SCOTUS decision, possibly as soon as Jan 9th, that actually looks like it could undo tariffs, which I think would cause a rally in the S&P493. You never know with someone like Trump at the handle, but it's hard for me to see any major negative catalysts for 2026, aside from 'concerns about valuations'. Maybe a single missed ER by nVidia will cause an unwind, or maybe global liquidity will begin to dry-up as most other OECD nations take more moderate monetary policies and more severe theories about the yen carry-trade show true. I always play defensively as I live off my savings - I intend to stay in SGOV in my long portfolio - I'll take a safe 4.25% over a risky 8.5% any day of the week. For options, where I normally sell CSPs, I'll likely pursue more delta neutral strategies.",

My long portfolio is currently 100 % SGOV . Without overanalyzing or cherry picking the simplest historic indicators show that market valuations right now are extremely rich of the type that always proceeds a major correction . Shiller PE nearing dotcom levels Trailing PE highest on record Forward PE at a ceiling it only surpasses during major market crises On top of that you have a flight to safety gold and a flight from risk bitcoin rounding out 2025 narratives . However despite this Im not_actually bearish for 2026 . There will be an comeuppance we all know this but I can see 2026 melting up another 510 % . This is because the single most influential variable the market has responded to in the last 15 years is liquidity and apparently the biggest source of liquidity isnt jobs or GDP but interest rates . This has driven the Main St vs. Wall St divide since 2008 . Now the US has an administration that is hell bent on lowering interest rates regardless of any orthodox impetus to do this . Trump will be appointing a new Fed chair and possibly more members who will basically vote how he says . Not_only that but I could see this new chair making statements during any moderate 10 % market correction that support QE and rescuing the market meaning almost any red month will be a buythedip type situation . We also have a pending SCOTUS decision possibly as soon as Jan 9th that actually looks like it could undo tariffs which I think would cause a rally in the SP493 . You never_know with someone like Trump at the handle but its hard for me to see any major negative catalysts for 2026 aside from concerns about valuations . Maybe a single missed ER by nVidia will cause an unwind or maybe global liquidity will begin to dryup as most other OECD nations take more moderate monetary policies and more severe theories about the yen carrytrade show true . I always play defensively as I live off my savings I intend to stay in SGOV in my long portfolio Ill take a safe 4.25 % over a risky 8.5 % any day of the week . For options where I normally sell CSPs Ill likely pursue more delta neutral strategies ."

But the stock has taken a beating: * 6 months: -15% * 1 year: -24% * 5 year: -5% The disconnect seems to be around competitive risk and whether Yelp's core business model is actually sustainable. Investors are clearly concerned about how the company fits in as AI becomes more integrated into search and discovery. Google and other search platforms are increasingly showing reviews and recommendations without sending users to Yelp. That's a real threat to their traffic and ad model. That said, fundamentally the company is still executing well. Revenue and profitability are moving in the right direction, margins are healthy, and they're returning cash to shareholders. So it's not like the business is falling apart. The question I'm wrestling with: is the market overreacting to the AI threat, or is there a structural decline coming that the financials haven't fully reflected yet? The valuation seems reasonable if the business model holds, but risky if it doesn't.",

But the stock has taken a beating 6 months 15 % 1 year 24 % 5 year 5 % The disconnect seems to be around competitive risk and whether Yelps core business model is actually sustainable . Investors are clearly concerned about how the company fits in as AI becomes more integrated into search and discovery . Google and other search platforms are increasingly showing reviews and recommendations without sending users to Yelp . Thats a real threat to their traffic and ad model . That said fundamentally the company is still executing well . Revenue and profitability are moving in the right direction margins are healthy and theyre returning cash to shareholders . So its not_like the business is falling apart . The question Im wrestling with is the market overreacting to the AI threat or is there a structural decline coming that the financials havent fully reflected yet The valuation seems reasonable if the business model holds but risky if it doesnt ."

      "selftext": "For each post, I used AI to analyze sentiment and predict relevant tickers. Then I cross-referenced it with data from Polygon.io. I compared the price 1 minute after the post and then 45 minutes later. Here’s the 5 posts with the biggest bullish impact: 1) The famous U.S. Steel partnership post. It's pretty long and I wanted to link it but Truth links aren't allowed on this sub, [so I'm linking an article talking about it]( There's a link to the post in the article if you want to read the post. Affected ticker: X, + 13.48% 2) I am pleased to announce that Bill Pulte will serve as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Bill needs no formal introduction to the Great Citizens of our Country, because they have seen, and many have experienced, his philanthropy firsthand. He believes in the incredible potential of our Nation, and will help us restore the American Dream FOR ALL. Congratulations Bill! Tickers: FNMA + 5.64% FMCC + 3.70% 3) Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Tickers: BBABA + 5.03% PDD + 4.94% FXI + 2.55% ASHR + 1.14% UUP + 0.69% 4) There are fake, untrue, and probably illegal rumors and/or statements made by, perhaps, market manipulators or short sellers, that I am interested in selling shares of Truth. THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SELLING! I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements, and who may have done so in the past, be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities. Truth is an important part of our historic win, and I deeply believe in it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Ticker: DJT + 4.18% 5) I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States. These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country. We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico. I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a “deal” between our two Countries. Ticker: EWW, + 3.40% I’ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon. Let me know if you're intersted in any stats I can pull for you. If more people are interested I’ll do a detailed write-up of the analysis.",

      "selftext_processed": "For each post I used AI to analyze sentiment and predict relevant tickers . Then I crossreferenced it with data from Polygon.io . I compared the price 1 minute after the post and then 45 minutes later . Here ’ s the 5 posts with the biggest bullish impact 1 The famous U.S. Steel partnership post . Its pretty long and I wanted to link it but Truth links arent allowed on this sub so Im linking an article talking about it Theres a link to the post in the article if you want to read the post . Affected ticker X 13.48 % 2 I am pleased to announce that Bill Pulte will serve as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency . Bill needs no_formal introduction to the Great Citizens of our Country because they have seen and many have experienced his philanthropy firsthand . He believes in the incredible potential of our Nation and will help us restore the American Dream FOR ALL . Congratulations Bill Tickers FNMA 5.64 % FMCC 3.70 % 3 Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World ’ s Markets I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 % effective immediately . At some point hopefully in the near future China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A. and other Countries is no_longer sustainable or acceptable . Conversely and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States including the Departments of Commerce Treasury and the USTR to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade Trade Barriers Tariffs Currency Manipulation and Non Monetary Tariffs and that these Countries have not_at my strong suggestion retaliated in any way shape or form against the United States I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period of 10 % also effective immediately . Thank you for your attention to this matter Tickers BBABA 5.03 % PDD 4.94 % FXI 2.55 % ASHR 1.14 % UUP 0.69 % 4 There are fake untrue and probably illegal rumors andor statements made by perhaps market manipulators or short sellers that I am interested in selling shares of Truth . THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE . I HAVE NO_INTENTION OF SELLING I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements and who may have done so in the past be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities . Truth is an important part of our historic win and I deeply believe in it . Thank you for your attention to this matter . MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Ticker DJT 4.18 % 5 I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico . It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States . These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal migrants into our Country . We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and highlevel Representatives of Mexico . I look forward to participating in those negotiations with President Sheinbaum as we attempt to achieve a “ deal ” between our two Countries . Ticker EWW 3.40 % I ’ ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon . Let me know if youre intersted in any stats I can pull for you . If more people are interested I ’ ll do a detailed writeup of the analysis ."

      "selftext": "Obviously a lot of traction of the outperformance of the [2025 WSB picks]( I wanted to do a slightly more thorough analysis to see if there was any real alpha here. **TLDR:** *evidence of excess returns, but the performance is best explained by a highly aggressive, factor-loaded portfolio in a strong market environment* To evaluate alpha, I used standard asset-pricing models, including CAPM and the Fama-French four-factor model (market, size, value, and momentum). These models help distinguish returns driven by skill from returns driven by exposure to known risk factors such as growth, momentum, or small-cap bias. The portfolio was an equal weighted basket of the 10 picks: * AMD * GOOG * HOOD * META * MSTR * PLTR * RDDT * RKLB * TSLA * WMT *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* (*Note: this analysis is through Nov 28, since Fama-French hasnt published daily returns for December*) **Descriptive Stats:** * **Portfolio Return**: 61.2% * **SPY Return**: 17.9% * **Portfolio Outperformance**: 43.3% * **Portfolio Vol**: 44.5% * **SPY Vol**: 20.2% * **Portfolio Sharpe | Sortino**: 1.85 | 2.82 * **SPY Sharpe | Sortino**: 0.86 | 1.29 ***Interpretation:*** *significant outperformance, with significantly more volatility* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **CAPM Regression** * **Adj. R-Squared**: 0.718 * **Market beta**: 1.88 ***Interpretation:*** *The portfolio had an extremely high beta. I.e. if the market goes up, all else equal you expect the portfolio to go up 1.88x the market. If it goes down, same thing in reverse* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **Fama-French Four Factor Regression** * **Mkt-Rf**: 1.59 *(very high market risk)* * **SMB**: 0.64 (small cap weighted) * **HML**: -0.73 *(strong growth bias)* * **MOM**: 0.51 *(significant momentum exposure)* ***Interpretation:*** *Confirms that the portfolio was significantly weighted towards \"levered\" growth names* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **Conclusions:** nothing novel here, WSB tilts towards higher risk, momentum names. If the same exercise is done in 2026, you should expect outperformance if the market goes up and underperformance if the market goes down. *Sources/Methods: Fama-French Library, yFinance, Python* *Happy to answer any questions or provide code if people are interested in running it themselves*",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, so, I am an idiot. a real big one, life-changing, dumb decisions type of idiot. If you spoke with me on October 1st, I was a legend. turned 80k to 220k+ in investments. Speak with me now, and you'll be speaking to a lowlife coward who turned the 220k+ into 70k. How I got there: Google calls, Soxl calls, UNH calls, Path calls. How I got to where I am now: Iren, CIFR, DGXX. What a fool I am lol wow. It happened quickly and slowly. Didn't realize how heavily I was invested in one sector. Most of my holdings were rotated into NBIS IREN and CIFR. Not just my cash tho, margin too. Then the landslide happened. Wow, did I get fucked. Some bouncing around happened, had some up days, but over the past 2 months, it has been a mental deterioration. Kept throwing in more cash on every dip. So, ya, I fucked up, been rather depressed lately. I was not conditioned nor prepared to handle that amount of money. I saw a 5% dip, and that was 12k, felt the need to micromanage my positions. bought and sold like crazy. SO what am I doing now? I refuse the narrative that I am a gambler, gambling my life away. It is true **I did gamble**, but that stops here. What I have done: Sold 70% of equity positions and 100% of my option contracts. Bought mainly VOO, and a small bit of QQQI, SPYI for income and BTCI for BTC exposure. This was my first real year of investing, a rough year mentally. Having trouble finding any motivation anymore. But I can't afford that. This is affecting my job performance, marriage, and home life. Constant panic attacks in the evenings, glued to my phone during market open, and glued to futures during market closed. I don't really believe in myself anymore. I spent years studying investing before seriously doing it. Had all my checks and balances and made a killing. But when it mattered most, I threw away my rules and f'd up. It was crazy, one day I checked my port in the morning, it was +3%. By lunch, it was -22%. By the next day, -35%. One more day after, -45%. I literally was in shock watching the red just climb. Since then, death by 1000 cuts. My current plan is to take a chill pill with investing. Focus solely on indexes with regular contributions. Then perhaps get back into stock picking with like 5% of port. it just sucks I decided to do this now. Not when I had 200k, not 150k, not even at 100k. But now that I have lost so much, I am pulling out of any chance to beat the market. If you read this all, be thankful this isn't you and use this as a reminder to re-read your rules. I never thought this would happen to me, scrolled x and reddit for years with my carefully curated portfolio offering advice, looking at losses and going ya, no, that will **never be me**. lol life had dif plans. For you experienced investors who may have gone through something similar, perhaps not as bad, or worse. What got you back on your feet? It is as if I am wearing red-coloured glasses. Everything just fucking sucks right now, can't find happiness in anything. EDIT: Thanks to everyone who is responding. It is keeping my head on my shoulders. I will keep reading comments and responding. I want this to have a positive effect on someone. Maybe a youngin who is thinking of options and leverage. Or someone who is up big right now and doesn't know if they should take profits.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everyone so I am an idiot . a real big one lifechanging dumb decisions type of idiot . If you spoke with me on October 1st I was a legend . turned 80k to 220k in investments . Speak with me now and youll be speaking to a lowlife coward who turned the 220k into 70k . How I got there Google calls Soxl calls UNH calls Path calls . How I got to where I am now Iren CIFR DGXX . What a fool I am lol wow . It happened quickly and slowly . Didnt realize how heavily I was invested in one sector . Most of my holdings were rotated into NBIS IREN and CIFR . Not_just my cash tho margin too . Then the landslide happened . Wow did I get fucked . Some bouncing around happened had some up days but over the past 2 months it has been a mental deterioration . Kept throwing in more cash on every dip . So ya I fucked up been rather depressed lately . I was not_conditioned nor prepared to handle that amount of money . I saw a 5 % dip and that was 12k felt the need to micromanage my positions . bought and sold like crazy . SO what am I doing now I refuse the narrative that I am a gambler gambling my life away . It is true I did gamble but that stops here . What I have done Sold 70 % of equity positions and 100 % of my option contracts . Bought mainly VOO and a small bit of QQQI SPYI for income and BTCI for BTC exposure . This was my first real year of investing a rough year mentally . Having trouble finding any motivation anymore . But I cant afford that . This is affecting my job performance marriage and home life . Constant panic attacks in the evenings glued to my phone during market open and glued to futures during market closed . I dont really believe in myself anymore . I spent years studying investing before seriously doing it . Had all my checks and balances and made a killing . But when it mattered most I threw away my rules and fd up . It was crazy one day I checked my port in the morning it was 3 % . By lunch it was 22 % . By the next day 35 % . One more day after 45 % . I literally was in shock watching the red just climb . Since then death by 1000 cuts . My current plan is to take a chill pill with investing . Focus solely on indexes with regular contributions . Then perhaps get back into stock picking with like 5 % of port . it just sucks I decided to do this now . Not_when I had 200k not_150k not_even at 100k . But now that I have lost so much I am pulling out of any chance to beat the market . If you read this all be thankful this isnt you and use this as a reminder to reread your rules . I never_thought this would happen to me scrolled x and reddit for years with my carefully curated portfolio offering advice looking at losses and going ya no_that will never be me . lol life had dif plans . For you experienced investors who may have gone through something similar perhaps not_as bad or worse . What got you back on your feet It is as if I am wearing redcoloured glasses . Everything just fucking sucks right now cant find happiness in anything . EDIT Thanks to everyone who is responding . It is keeping my head on my shoulders . I will keep reading comments and responding . I want this to have a positive effect on someone . Maybe a youngin who is thinking of options and leverage . Or someone who is up big right now and doesnt know if they should take profits ."

      "selftext": "I want to share some analysis I’ve been thinking about. I hold AMD stock and am pulling the trigger on NVIDIA puts. This is for discussion and research purposes only. # 1. Burry’s Thesis Michael Burry’s argument is that AI hardware depreciation is being understated. Companies are putting 5 to 6 year useful lives on GPUs that may actually become obsolete in 2 to 3 years ([en.bloomingbit.io]( This could make reported earnings appear stronger than reality. Burry estimates this mismatch could total $176 billion across the industry between 2026 and 2028 ([investing.com]( He compares NVIDIA to Cisco in the dot-com era ([sahmcapital.com]( and is using long-dated puts expiring in 2027 (reddit). The mismatch between accounting and economic reality is real. But Burry may underestimate AMD’s strategic position. # 2. How NVIDIA Stumbled Into AI NVIDIA’s AI dominance was not planned from day one. CUDA started as a way to make GPUs useful for general-purpose computing, not AI. Ian Buck, a Stanford CS PhD, experimented with GPUs for non-graphics workloads. His project, Brook, became the foundation for CUDA ([en.wikipedia.org]( The AI breakthrough came from independent researchers. Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto trained AlexNet on NVIDIA GPUs, showing that deep neural networks could outperform CPU solutions by orders of magnitude ([en.wikipedia.org]( Key takeaway: NVIDIA adapted to a discovery made outside the company. That “stumble” created their early dominance, but nothing guarantees the next discovery will not favor AMD. # 3. AMD’s Hardware Readiness MI300X launched with [192GB HBM3 memory and 5.3 TB/s bandwidth]( giving it a [36% memory advantage over NVIDIA's H200]( (141GB HBM3e @ 4.8 TB/s). Cost is approximately $10-14k per MI300X versus $40-44k for H200 - roughly one quarter of NVIDIA's price. [Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and TensorWave deployed 327,000 MI300X units in 2024]( with Microsoft using MI300X to power Azure OpenAI services. This demonstrates enterprise adoption at scale, not experimental deployments. The main constraint is ROCm software maturity. Historical precedent suggests this is temporary - CUDA itself took years to achieve ecosystem dominance. If ROCm adoption accelerates as enterprises validate cost savings, AMD's hardware advantage could scale rapidly. # 4. EPYC Playbook Applied to GPUs AMD has a track record of methodical, generation-over-generation growth in server CPUs: |Phase|CPU Generation|Result| |:-|:-|:-| |1|Naples|Re-entry into data centers| |2|Rome|Competitive performance and cost gains attention| |3|Milan|Default choice for workloads| |4|Genoa/Turin|Dominant market share| This shows AMD can take share slowly and structurally. The same pattern could apply to MI400 against NVIDIA GPUs. # 5. The AI Market as a Gradual Rotation The AI bubble is not bursting. That implies sudden collapse. What I see is a gradual rotation. * NVIDIA could slowly lose margin and market share as AMD scales * Enterprises may adopt ROCm at a measured pace * Refresh cycles could stretch * Capital may rotate from NVIDIA to AMD over time There is no expectation of panic selling. Prices may adjust gradually as these trends unfold. Burry’s long-dated puts reflect structural pressure rather than an overnight crash. # 6. Signals to Watch * MI400 benchmark comparisons versus B300 * Cloud providers adopting AMD GPUs at scale * ROCm developer adoption and enterprise integration * NVIDIA guidance versus actual procurement decisions Tracking these indicators could highlight when capital rotation accelerates. # 7. Bottom Line * NVIDIA benefited from a discovery made outside the company. AMD could be next. * Burry is right about depreciation and earnings mismatch, but he underestimates AMD's potential impact. * The AI shift is gradual and structural. * If ROCm adoption scales like CUDA did, MI400 could reshape the AI hardware landscape. This analysis is based on research and historical patterns. History is repeating itself, and I am bullish on AMD beating NVIDIA *just like they did with Intel.*",

      "selftext_processed": "I want to share some analysis I ’ ve been thinking about . I hold AMD stock and am pulling the trigger on NVIDIA puts . This is for discussion and research purposes only . 1 . Burry ’ s Thesis Michael Burry ’ s argument is that AI hardware depreciation is being understated . Companies are putting 5 to 6 year useful lives on GPUs that may actually become obsolete in 2 to 3 years en.bloomingbit.io This could make reported earnings appear stronger than reality . Burry estimates this mismatch could total $ 176 billion across the industry between 2026 and 2028 investing.com He compares NVIDIA to Cisco in the dotcom era sahmcapital.com and is using longdated puts expiring in 2027 reddit . The mismatch between accounting and economic reality is real . But Burry may underestimate AMD ’ s strategic position . 2 . How NVIDIA Stumbled Into AI NVIDIA ’ s AI dominance was not_planned from day one . CUDA started as a way to make GPUs useful for generalpurpose computing not_AI . Ian Buck a Stanford CS PhD experimented with GPUs for nongraphics workloads . His project Brook became the foundation for CUDA en.wikipedia.org The AI breakthrough came from independent researchers . Alex Krizhevsky Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto trained AlexNet on NVIDIA GPUs showing that deep neural networks could outperform CPU solutions by orders of magnitude en.wikipedia.org Key takeaway NVIDIA adapted to a discovery made outside the company . That “ stumble ” created their early dominance but nothing_guarantees the next discovery will not_favor AMD . 3 . AMD ’ s Hardware Readiness MI300X launched with 192GB HBM3 memory and 5.3 TBs bandwidth giving it a 36 % memory advantage over NVIDIAs H200 141GB HBM3e 4.8 TBs . Cost is approximately $ 1014k per MI300X versus $ 4044k for H200 roughly one quarter of NVIDIAs price . Microsoft Meta Oracle and TensorWave deployed 327000 MI300X units in 2024 with Microsoft using MI300X to power Azure OpenAI services . This demonstrates enterprise adoption at scale not_experimental deployments . The main constraint is ROCm software maturity . Historical precedent suggests this is temporary CUDA itself took years to achieve ecosystem dominance . If ROCm adoption accelerates as enterprises validate cost savings AMDs hardware advantage could scale rapidly . 4 . EPYC Playbook Applied to GPUs AMD has a track record of methodical generationovergeneration growth in server CPUs PhaseCPU GenerationResult 1NaplesReentry into data centers 2RomeCompetitive performance and cost gains attention 3MilanDefault choice for workloads 4GenoaTurinDominant market share This shows AMD can take share slowly and structurally . The same pattern could apply to MI400 against NVIDIA GPUs . 5 . The AI Market as a Gradual Rotation The AI bubble is not_bursting . That implies sudden collapse . What I see is a gradual rotation . NVIDIA could slowly lose margin and market share as AMD scales Enterprises may adopt ROCm at a measured pace Refresh cycles could stretch Capital may rotate from NVIDIA to AMD over time There is no_expectation of panic selling . Prices may adjust gradually as these trends unfold . Burry ’ s longdated puts reflect structural pressure rather than an overnight crash . 6 . Signals to Watch MI400 benchmark comparisons versus B300 Cloud providers adopting AMD GPUs at scale ROCm developer adoption and enterprise integration NVIDIA guidance versus actual procurement decisions Tracking these indicators could highlight when capital rotation accelerates . 7 . Bottom Line NVIDIA benefited from a discovery made outside the company . AMD could be next . Burry is right about depreciation and earnings mismatch but he underestimates AMDs potential impact . The AI shift is gradual and structural . If ROCm adoption scales like CUDA did MI400 could reshape the AI hardware landscape . This analysis is based on research and historical patterns . History is repeating itself and I am bullish on AMD beating NVIDIA just like they did with Intel ."

Longer life cycle(further cost saving). 1/4 of $EOSE pipeline is tied to data centers, best fast response alternative to outdated diesel generators and more cost efficient. Grid support is superior to volatile AI power demands. EoS Energy batteries are best suited for Mid/longer duration, not short burst, lithium power is more suitable but we will get to it in the verdict. $EOSE : 11.40 **Shares Float** : 317M **Short Float** : 26% **Short Ratio** : 3.60 **Insider Own** : 2.3% 🚩 **Inst Own** : 49% ___ **Q1 2025** : Expectation: Revenue ~**$10.4M**; - Actual: Revenue **$10.5M** **Q2 2025** : Expectation: Revenue **$24.1M** , - Actual: Revenue **$15.2M** (non-cash) **Q3 2025** : Expectation: Revenue **$39.6M** - Actual: Revenue **$30.5M**(non-cash) **Q4 2025** : Production & Delivery Ramp, Strong revenue is expected (trust me bro). It’s worth mentioning at this point that the issue with revenue is not the demand, demand is unlimited. Productivity will dictate success here, how fast can company produce the product and have it on the shelf for delivery. The possibility for upside here is massive. **2026 Catalysts / Developments** : **Q4/FY2025 Earnings Report**: late February 2026, key updates on ramp execution, margins, and initial 2026 outlook. **Line 2 Production Start**: H2 2026; enables multi-GWh capacity expansion. **Major Order Announcements**: High anticipation for hyperscaler/utility deals from ~$22.6B pipeline and ~$644M backlog. **Jan 1 2026** : Section 301 - Lithium Ion Batteries tariffs from China to increase from 7% to 25%(Big), : #:~:text=United%20States%20Finalizes%20Section%20301%20Tariff%20Increases%20on%20Imports%20from%20China,-Alert&text=On%20September%2013%2C%202024%2C%20the,and%20finalize%20the%20tariff%20lists.&text=Tariffs%20on%20semiconductors%2C%20respirators%20and,soon%20issue%20a%20separate%20notice. China controls 80% of lithium supply chain, $EOSE mitigates that with different technology. We see rapid growth in numbers of AI/Datacenter. The rising power demands, and the need for power technology will rise with it. I strongly believe EoS Energy has positioned itself in forefront of demand and it’s only a matter of time.

      "selftext": "In 2026, who will lead the next wave of AI? The answer may lie within the optical communications sector. As GPUs and ASICs undergo rapid upgrades and iterations, the marginal gains in computing power are increasingly constrained by the physical limits of network bandwidth. The widening gap between computing power and transport capacity is shifting the industry's focus toward interconnect technologies. The market's underlying logic may shift from purely purchasing computing power to acquiring transport capacity. In this transition, the strategic importance of optical communications could undergo a revaluation, emerging as a critical variable that cannot be overlooked in the latter half of the AI era. If the past two years were dominated by GPUs, 2026 will officially usher in an era driven by both computing power and transport capacity. From SemiAnalysis's optical supercycle thesis to the industry chain's three-dimensional expansion Scale Out, Scale Across, and Scale Up all validate a fundamental truth: optical communication is no longer a peripheral accessory for data centers, but the bottleneck determining the upper limit of AI cluster performance.

      "selftext": "The market keeps treating \"made in the USA\" like marketing. In energy infrastructure, it is increasingly a constraint. NextNRG (NXXT) announced an MOU with A123 Systems, a US-based battery manufacturer, to source containerized storage for microgrids and resilient power projects. The bullish part is not nationalism. It is risk control. Domestic sourcing can reduce a few real problems that kill timelines: * Tariff and trade policy surprises. * Long shipping lead times and logistics variability. * Customer requirements tied to procurement rules or local content. If your target customers include hospitals, utilities, and critical facilities, procurement is conservative. They care about safety, certifications, and reliable delivery. Even if a cheaper pack exists overseas, the lowest price is not always the winning bid when downtime risk is high. NXXT is trying to scale infrastructure deployments, aligning supply with domestic compliance and trends could matter more than we think. Not financial advice.",

After getting stuck in a few losing positions, I kept averaging down and eventually worked my way back to breakeven. By 2020, I didn’t just recover I actually made over 50 grand. Honestly, if the story ended right there, that would’ve been perfect But once I tasted those speculative gains, I lost control. I got way too confident, almost reckless. I threw every dollar I’d saved over six years of working into the market, and I even borrowed just about everything I could. All in, it was over 500k Around November 2021, I went all in on NVDA. In my head, I was already imagining the stock ripping higher, selling near the top, and finally living the good life. Instead, I walked straight into the darkest stretch. The stock just kept getting hammered, all the way down to around 13. Six years of savings slowly disappeared right in front of me. After a small bounce, I finally called it and walked away Now the stock’s way above where I ever hoped it would be back then but it doesn’t belong to who I was at the time protocol. I’ve since paid off all my debt, and I’m still active in the market today I’m not sharing this for sympathy. I’m sharing it as a warning to anyone gearing up to go big in the market: don’t trade blind, and don’t let your ego take over. You need a real plan and real risk management.

      "selftext": "MU has been strong recently and the move has clearly been driven by improving fundamentals rather than just sentiment. From what we’ve seen so far Micron appears to be benefiting meaningfully from AI related memory demand particularly around HBM. The progress on HBM3E and early HBM4 sampling suggests MU may be executing well relative to peers especially in terms of timing and customer adoption. That said it’s still a competitive and capital intensive industry. Valuation is where opinions seem to diverge. On one hand the stock is trading near all time highs which naturally raises questions about how much future growth is already priced in. On the other hand earnings growth expectations have increased materially as AI demand ramps and capacity tightens. If that demand proves durable the current premium could be justified by forward earnings rather than short term momentum. What I’m still trying to assess is whether MU is genuinely shifting away from being viewed primarily as a cyclical memory stock and toward a more structural AI growth story or if it remains cyclical at its core with AI simply amplifying the upcycle. I currently hold MU so I’m interested in how others especially long term holders are thinking about this transition and how they’re framing risk and upside from here.",

      "selftext_processed": "MU has been strong recently and the move has clearly been driven by improving fundamentals rather than just sentiment . From what we ’ ve seen so far Micron appears to be benefiting meaningfully from AI related memory demand particularly around HBM . The progress on HBM3E and early HBM4 sampling suggests MU may be executing well relative to peers especially in terms of timing and customer adoption . That said it ’ s still a competitive and capital intensive industry . Valuation is where opinions seem to diverge . On one hand the stock is trading near all time highs which naturally raises questions about how much future growth is already priced in . On the other hand earnings growth expectations have increased materially as AI demand ramps and capacity tightens . If that demand proves durable the current premium could be justified by forward earnings rather than short term momentum . What I ’ m still trying to assess is whether MU is genuinely shifting away from being viewed primarily as a cyclical memory stock and toward a more structural AI growth story or if it remains cyclical at its core with AI simply amplifying the upcycle . I currently hold MU so I ’ m interested in how others especially long term holders are thinking about this transition and how they ’ re framing risk and upside from here ."

      "title": "TSMC Officially Launches Mass Production of 2nm Process + Stock Logic and Future Outlook",
      "selftext": "Just saw the latest official technology roadmap update: TSMC 2nm chip process (N2) has commenced mass production as scheduled in Q4 2025, a timeline explicitly stated on their website. Following the 3nm node, this marks a crucial milestone in TSMC process evolution as it truly enters the GAA transistor era. Market reports indicate that 2nm process capacity is largely booked through late 2026, with Apple reportedly securing a significant portion (roughly half or more) of the initial production volume. Additional major clients may follow. Over recent months, TSMC stock price has demonstrated steady performance amid the global semiconductor recovery amplified by AI and smart device demand. With the confirmation of 2nm mass production, the market is further amplifying the company's technological leadership advantage. TSMC confirmation of 2nm N2 mass production (Q4 2025) solidifies its leading pace in global process technology competition. This may not represent a future development but rather an ongoing technological transformation. How significant do you believe the impact of 2nm mass production will be on TSMC valuation? Is this a “confirmation of future growth,” or has the market already priced it in? What implications does this hold for future stock prices? Could factors like capacity cycles, yield rates, or order issues potentially disrupt the timeline?",

Following the 3nm node this marks a crucial milestone in TSMC process evolution as it truly enters the GAA transistor era . Market reports indicate that 2nm process capacity is largely booked through late 2026 with Apple reportedly securing a significant portion roughly half or more of the initial production volume . Additional major clients may follow . Over recent months TSMC stock price has demonstrated steady performance amid the global semiconductor recovery amplified by AI and smart device demand . With the confirmation of 2nm mass production the market is further amplifying the companys technological leadership advantage . TSMC confirmation of 2nm N2 mass production Q4 2025 solidifies its leading pace in global process technology competition . This may not_represent a future development but rather an ongoing technological transformation . How significant do you believe the impact of 2nm mass production will be on TSMC valuation Is this a “ confirmation of future growth ” or has the market already priced it in What implications does this hold for future stock prices Could factors like capacity cycles yield rates or order issues potentially disrupt the timeline"

      "selftext": "The narrative in AI hardware is undergoing a significant shift. NVIDIA is officially entering the ASIC and inference market through its partnership with Groq, involving about 20 billion dollars in inference machines. This marks a new phase in AI computing NVIDIA is expanding from GPU-dominated training into ASIC dominated inference. What does this mean? Here are some of my guesses GPUs still firmly dominate AI model training. But hyperscale cloud providers and enterprise customers are increasingly leaning toward specialized chips, ASICs, to better control power, depreciation costs, and unit economics, achieving low-latency, cost-effective inference deployments. This does not mean NVIDIA is pessimistic, on the contrary it shows AI spending is diversifying, with funds flowing into multiple chip architectures rather than concentrating on a single winner. ASICs are evolving from a previously niche position to becoming a core necessity for cost efficient inference in the AI stack. Overall, in the thin liquidity environment at year-end, this structural shift in the AI hardware sector is drawing market attention, but short-term price volatility calls for caution. More meaningful trend validation might not come until January 2026. Will NVDA continue to rise and break the 5 trillion mark? What does today's market drop signal? I am already a long-term holder, but will the market shift in2026 and should I continue holding?",

But I think it’s fair to separate two things: 1) the technology 2) the price we’re paying for it AI demand is real. The spending is real. The use cases will keep expanding. What gives me pause is valuation expectations. Right now the market seems to assume: margins stay near peak levels hyperscalers keep spending without pushback competitive pressure doesn’t really matter growth stays linear even as numbers get massive That’s a lot of “ifs” priced in. For me, this isn’t a short or a panic sell. It’s more of a position management thing: holding a core trimming on big runs avoiding fresh size at stretched multiples trading around it instead of marrying it Great businesses can still be bad buys at the wrong price. That’s not bearish it’s just risk management. Curious how others are handling it: adding here? holding but not chasing? or waiting for better entries?",

What gives me pause is valuation expectations . Right now the market seems to assume margins stay near peak levels hyperscalers keep spending without pushback competitive pressure doesn ’ t really matter growth stays linear even as numbers get massive That ’ s a lot of “ ifs ” priced in . For me this isn ’ t a short or a panic sell . It ’ s more of a position management thing holding a core trimming on big runs avoiding fresh size at stretched multiples trading around it instead of marrying it Great businesses can still be bad buys at the wrong price . That ’ s not_bearish it ’ s just risk management . Curious how others are handling it adding here holding but not_chasing or waiting for better entries"

Would the dividends that are being reinvested be enough money to keep the stock growing or?? Should I just put this money towards opening an IRA??

They run their fully driverless service in Abu Dhabi with Uber. In Europe, WRD secured their approval in Switzerland's Zurich region and the company expanding fleets in Singapore, planning to operate fully driverless in 2026. Most importantly, the company focus on Level 4 autonomy in defined markets. Rather than just concentrating on single one, WeRide is contributing to the broader evolution of autonomous driving industry. WeRide is advancing their vehicles with WePilot 3.0, one-stage, end-to-end ADAS system, developed with Bosc. The system helps the vehicles to see and act, more like human driving behavior in real time. These efforts clearly show how the autonomy market is moving forward in 2016.",

      "selftext": "I drew colossus from Starcraft 2 to represent laser beams. And prepared a whole thesis but kept getting automodded for \"low quality\". So here's the more TLDR version of my thesis: The Entire AI Industry is shifting to photonics from Google TPU to optical interconnects. The entire AI \"Growth\" story ends in 2026 if there's no InP substrates + materials. BUT GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT ALL? One Company: $AXTI. There's two bottlenecks: InP Substrates - \\- Hyperscaler optics (TPU pods, etc) \\- Optical transceivers (5g, data) \\- LiDAR (robotaxis, drones, military) \\-Optical Modules (interconnect clusters) \\- Silicon photonics laser dies (Nvidia’s future co-packaged optics and Intel/Broadcom SiPh engines use InP CW laser arrays.) This is a DUOPOLY from \\-AXTI (est. \\~30–35%) \\-Sumitomo (est.\\~30%) \\- JX Nippon (est. 10-15%) Indium Phosphide (the source material for everything): Vital Materials - 35% AXT - 25% Before, this was a commodity with low TAM just for telecom. Now they're used for the entire AI buildout. Just to give u an example $AXTI -> $LITE -> $GOOGL TPU. without any of these members, the program shuts down. Google would literally pay $5B (50 TIMES prices + \\~$140m TAM from 2024) DIRECTLY to one of these suppliers -> hand to COHR just so their whole TPU program doesn't stall because Meta decided to buy them out. And this would only be a like a 3-4% added cost to their BOM because this thing was so cheap. If Meta does it first, then Google's TPU program stalls. If Google does it first Microsoft's ASIC problem stalls. THE WORLD IS AT MAX CAPACITY RIGHT NOW (demand > supply by multiple factors pre-ramp) AND THIS IS GAME THEORY on materials supply chains. Guess who shows up twice in the WHOLE AI bottleneck? Both as the duopoly bottleneck and the duopoly bottleneck of the bottleneck AXTI. This is the holy grail of supply chain analysis + materials research. Nobody's posted about this stock here in the past 5 years, you're welcome. Anyway I decided to max OTM some spare change on Calls last Friday, because there's a low chance this goes from $15 to $150 if we see the same memory supply stock in 2026. I will buy more shares on Monday when markets open up but wanted to share this at the start as proof. NFI, there's a chance China sends this to $0 with export controls so don't follow along I just wanted to share my thoughts. But if this goes to $0 so does the entire growth phase of the AI buildout. I just thought this could also easily be a $7B company given they control 1/3rd of the world's entire substrate capacity and then 1/4th of the world's entire materials used for AI buildout. It's a monopoly in mining -> refining -> substrate production. And a duopoly for InP substrate production and Indium Phosphide. I just wanted to share as proof in case this becomes legendary. TLDR: THE ENTIRE AI INDUSTRY IS BOTTLENECKED TWO TIMES BY THE SAME COMPANY. FOUND THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE MANY TRILLION USD WESTERN AI BUILDOUT IS SOME $700m COMPANY CALLED AXTI, WORTH LESS THAN SOME PRE REVENUE LLM STARTUP.",

      "selftext_processed": "I drew colossus from Starcraft 2 to represent laser beams . And prepared a whole thesis but kept getting automodded for low quality . So heres the more TLDR version of my thesis The Entire AI Industry is shifting to photonics from Google TPU to optical interconnects . The entire AI Growth story ends in 2026 if theres no_InP substrates materials . BUT GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT ALL One Company $ AXTI . Theres two bottlenecks InP Substrates Hyperscaler optics TPU pods etc Optical transceivers 5g data LiDAR robotaxis drones military Optical Modules interconnect clusters Silicon photonics laser dies Nvidia ’ s future copackaged optics and IntelBroadcom SiPh engines use InP CW laser arrays . This is a DUOPOLY from AXTI est . 30–35 % Sumitomo est.30 % JX Nippon est . 1015 % Indium Phosphide the source material for everything Vital Materials 35 % AXT 25 % Before this was a commodity with low TAM just for telecom . Now theyre used for the entire AI buildout . Just to give u an example $ AXTI $ LITE $ GOOGL TPU . without any of these members the program shuts down . Google would literally pay $ 5B 50 TIMES prices $ 140m TAM from 2024 DIRECTLY to one of these suppliers hand to COHR just so their whole TPU program doesnt stall because Meta decided to buy them out . And this would only be a like a 34 % added cost to their BOM because this thing was so cheap . If Meta does it first then Googles TPU program stalls . If Google does it first Microsofts ASIC problem stalls . THE WORLD IS AT MAX CAPACITY RIGHT NOW demand supply by multiple factors preramp AND THIS IS GAME THEORY on materials supply chains . Guess who shows up twice in the WHOLE AI bottleneck Both as the duopoly bottleneck and the duopoly bottleneck of the bottleneck AXTI . This is the holy grail of supply chain analysis materials research . Nobodys_posted about this stock here in the past 5 years youre welcome . Anyway I decided to max OTM some spare change on Calls last Friday because theres a low chance this goes from $ 15 to $ 150 if we see the same memory supply stock in 2026 . I will buy more shares on Monday when markets open up but wanted to share this at the start as proof . NFI theres a chance China sends this to $ 0 with export controls so dont follow along I just wanted to share my thoughts . But if this goes to $ 0 so does the entire growth phase of the AI buildout . I just thought this could also easily be a $ 7B company given they control 13rd of the worlds entire substrate capacity and then 14th of the worlds entire materials used for AI buildout . Its a monopoly in mining refining substrate production . And a duopoly for InP substrate production and Indium Phosphide . I just wanted to share as proof in case this becomes legendary . TLDR THE ENTIRE AI INDUSTRY IS BOTTLENECKED TWO TIMES BY THE SAME COMPANY . FOUND THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE MANY TRILLION USD WESTERN AI BUILDOUT IS SOME $ 700m COMPANY CALLED AXTI WORTH LESS THAN SOME PRE REVENUE LLM STARTUP ."

      "selftext": "So ever since \"Liberation Day\" there have been countless deals that have been made with President Trump to heavily invest in the US. Dozens of countries have promised to throw hundreds of billions of dollars into the US. Almost every single tech company has promised some kid of major investment. Many of these deals were made several months ago so I would think now would be an appropriate time to check for any significant updates. However, after doing some digging, all I can find are data centers being built around the US for AI. Stargate, for example, a $500B deal announced in January 2025 has just gotten approval from Michigan to build a data center. From my limited understanding, while AI is huge, in terms of manufacturing it is quite minimal as it is basically just allowing models to train on stored data, and once built, these centers basically just become massive servers that aren't continuously producing goods. I can find nothing on all the promised investments from the EU, Canada, Mexico, and several Asian countries in US manufacturing. Curious if other people have better info on what this \"manufacturing boom\" that Trump has promised will look like in 2026. I know this is quite a naive, and somewhat overly optimistic question to ask, but we did see an uptick in GDP due to increased exports and so while 80 to even 90% of all these \"deals might be BS, even 5% of it being legit would be quite a significant amount being invested if we are taking the numbers thrown around at face value.",

      "selftext_processed": "So ever since Liberation Day there have been countless deals that have been made with President Trump to heavily invest in the US . Dozens of countries have promised to throw hundreds of billions of dollars into the US . Almost every single tech company has promised some kid of major investment . Many of these deals were made several months ago so I would think now would be an appropriate time to check for any significant updates . However after doing some digging all I can find are data centers being built around the US for AI . Stargate for example a $ 500B deal announced in January 2025 has just gotten approval from Michigan to build a data center . From my limited understanding while AI is huge in terms of manufacturing it is quite minimal as it is basically just allowing models to train on stored data and once built these centers basically just become massive servers that arent continuously producing goods . I can find nothing_on all the promised investments from the EU Canada Mexico and several Asian countries in US manufacturing . Curious if other people have better info on what this manufacturing boom that Trump has promised will look like in 2026 . I know this is quite a naive and somewhat overly optimistic question to ask but we did see an uptick in GDP due to increased exports and so while 80 to even 90 % of all these deals might be BS even 5 % of it being legit would be quite a significant amount being invested if we are taking the numbers thrown around at face value ."

      "selftext": "Some more stock ideas from the latest issue of Barron’s Magazine. **CRM** Salesforce is highlighted as this week’s stock pick. Salesforce had a bad 2025 and is down more than 20%, but Barron’s thinks this is a bad reaction to the impact of AI on Salesforce’s business. Salesforce may prove to be one of the winners in the AI game with its AgentForce services that are gaining traction with customers. And in the meantime Salesforce’s current services are going gangbusters and both revenue and margins are growing. Profit margins have more than doubled over the last few years. **RDDT** Reddit is growing faster than most social media and customer engagement is double that of its peers. AI is also a tailwind for Reddit’s licensing and ad revenue. Earnings per share are growing by 60-100% this year so analysts from Needham, Truist and Citi are choosing RDDT as a top pick for 2026. **NKE** Nike got two mentions in this week’s magazine. First Barron’s noted Tim Cook’s big $3M open market insider buy of NKE stock as a sign of confidence in a turnaround. And second Nike was also noted as a possible beneficiary of a potential $2000 check being paid out of the OBBBA as a tariff rebate to taxpayers this year. Barron’s posits that retail stocks like Nike stand to benefit the most from this kind of stimulus.",

First Barron ’ s noted Tim Cook ’ s big $ 3M open market insider buy of NKE stock as a sign of confidence in a turnaround . And second Nike was also noted as a possible beneficiary of a potential $ 2000 check being paid out of the OBBBA as a tariff rebate to taxpayers this year . Barron ’ s posits that retail stocks like Nike stand to benefit the most from this kind of stimulus ."

      "selftext": "I opened and funded my moomoo account about three months ago because I was finally done with my previous broker. To be blunt, I came from Robinhood. I’ve wanted to leave ever since the GME fiasco where they turned off the buy button, but I honestly just got lazy and dragged my feet for years. Recently, I decided to finally pull the trigger and move to a platform that prioritizes stability over gamification. Here is my honest breakdown after using moomoo daily: Pros: * Market Data: The free Level 2 data is a game-changer. Unlike my old app where I had to pay extra or just guess, seeing the order book depth here helps a lot. * Trading Hours: The access to full pre-market (4 AM ET) is excellent. I like being able to react to news before the standard market opens. * charts: The charting is intense. I honestly only use VWAP and RSI, but it’s nice to have a million other indicators available if I ever get smart enough to use them. Cons: * The UI is... A Lot: It’s super cluttered. Information overload is real. Has anyone else finally made the switch to moomoo recently? For those of you who have been using moomoo for a while, what are your thoughts on the platform? Did you find the transition difficult, or did the better tools make it worth the effort?",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I turned 18 in April. I have a long time horizon (40+ years), and would appreciate some feedback on my portfolio construction. I’m trying to be intentional about account placement, taxes, and risk. Before anyone says anything, I’ve maxed my Roth IRA already, and plan to keep on doing so. I also had roughly 2k in my taxable. **Roth IRA (growth focused):** **• 65% VOO** **• 35% QQQM** My thinking here is to maximize long term tax free growth and lean into equities while I’m young. **Taxable account:** **• 60% equal weighted sector growth stocks** **• 30% AVUV (US small cap value)** **• 10% SPYI** The sector growth basket is equal weighted across 20 holdings and is intentionally concentrated. It is approximately 55% technology, 20% healthcare, 10% financials, 5% consumer discretionary, 5% consumer staples, and 5% crypto via a thematic ETF. The goal is to seek some alpha in taxable while keeping positions tax efficient and long term. This is also the part of the portfolio where I expect most people to have opinions, especially around the tech concentration and the decision to hold individual stocks instead of only broad index funds. AVUV is included to diversify away from mega cap growth and to capture the small cap value premium over long periods. SPYI is intentionally kept small. The idea is to slowly build an income producing position in taxable over decades so that later in life it can provide meaningful cash flow, while reinvesting all distributions for now. I am not trying to market time or trade frequently. This is meant to be a long term, mostly hands off strategy with occasional rebalancing. **Curious to hear thoughts on:** **• Asset location choices** **• The role of AVUV alongside growth heavy exposure** **• Whether starting a small income position this early makes sense or is inefficient** Thanks in advance for any feedback.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone I turned 18 in April . I have a long time horizon 40 years and would appreciate some feedback on my portfolio construction . I ’ m trying to be intentional about account placement taxes and risk . Before anyone says anything I ’ ve maxed my Roth IRA already and plan to keep on doing so . I also had roughly 2k in my taxable . Roth IRA growth focused • 65 % VOO • 35 % QQQM My thinking here is to maximize long term tax free growth and lean into equities while I ’ m young . Taxable account • 60 % equal weighted sector growth stocks • 30 % AVUV US small cap value • 10 % SPYI The sector growth basket is equal weighted across 20 holdings and is intentionally concentrated . It is approximately 55 % technology 20 % healthcare 10 % financials 5 % consumer discretionary 5 % consumer staples and 5 % crypto via a thematic ETF . The goal is to seek some alpha in taxable while keeping positions tax efficient and long term . This is also the part of the portfolio where I expect most people to have opinions especially around the tech concentration and the decision to hold individual stocks instead of only broad index funds . AVUV is included to diversify away from mega cap growth and to capture the small cap value premium over long periods . SPYI is intentionally kept small . The idea is to slowly build an income producing position in taxable over decades so that later in life it can provide meaningful cash flow while reinvesting all distributions for now . I am not_trying to market time or trade frequently . This is meant to be a long term mostly hands off strategy with occasional rebalancing . Curious to hear thoughts on • Asset location choices • The role of AVUV alongside growth heavy exposure • Whether starting a small income position this early makes sense or is inefficient Thanks in advance for any feedback ."

      "selftext": "I’ve seen a lot of information and talking points supporting either side. It’s a complicated question that has to consider a lot variables. Market returns, interests rates, tax implications, housing markets, stock trends, the economy etc. should all be considered. I have a 6.8% interest rate and owe $238k left on my home. I did the math and if I pay an additional $5000 a month, I will have my home paid off by February 2030 or in 4 years. 25 years early and would save $235k+ in interest. Very enticing. I usually invest roughly $5000 into the market a month so this is all possible with my income. So I’m considering letting that sit for least 3 years and either throwing $5000 at VOO or a similar etf and waiting till it hits $238k and sell to payoff the mortgage or just paying the additional $5000 right into my mortgage and handling that separately. There’s no growth but it’s a guaranteed return. any thoughts or considerations are appreciated. I just want to be debt free and happy by 2030… just not quite sure the best route to get there.",

      "selftext": "Nvidia GTC March 16-19, 2026 in San Jose, California. You can expect a livestreamed keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and likely a lot of announcements. One thing to note about the timing of the event is that it comes just two months after Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada Jan 5-9 2026. Whatever consumer-facing products NVIDIA has in store (could we finally get a GeForce RTX 50 Super series announcement?) are likely to be detailed on around CES. At GTC in March, the focus will be on the \"next wave of AI innovation.\" \"NVIDIA GTC is the premier global AI conference, where developers, researchers, and business leaders come together to explore the next wave of AI innovation. From physical AI and AI factories to agentic AI and inference, GTC 2026 will showcase the breakthroughs shaping every industry,\" NVIDIA states on its GTC page. For context, NVIDIA laid out its two-year AI roadmap at its GTC event in March of this year with Vera Rubin NVL144 planned for the second half of 2026 and Rubin Ultra NVL576 on track to launch in 2027. NVIDIA also unveiled its its Blackwell RTX Pro to turbocharge AI workstations, servers, and laptops, and trotted out its Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU with 288GB of HBM3e memory on a single package. The latter solution paves the way for 20TB of HBM3e on a rack of Blackwell Ultra GB300 aa (such as NVIDIA's GB300 NVL72) and a monstrous 1.1 exaFLOPS of FP4 compute. Do you think there will be any big announcements made at GTC 2026?",

      "selftext_processed": "Nvidia GTC March 1619 2026 in San Jose California . You can expect a livestreamed keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and likely a lot of announcements . One thing to note about the timing of the event is that it comes just two months after Consumer Electronics Show CES in Las Vegas Nevada Jan 59 2026 . Whatever consumerfacing products NVIDIA has in store could we finally get a GeForce RTX 50 Super series announcement are likely to be detailed on around CES . At GTC in March the focus will be on the next wave of AI innovation . NVIDIA GTC is the premier global AI conference where developers researchers and business leaders come together to explore the next wave of AI innovation . From physical AI and AI factories to agentic AI and inference GTC 2026 will showcase the breakthroughs shaping every industry NVIDIA states on its GTC page . For context NVIDIA laid out its twoyear AI roadmap at its GTC event in March of this year with Vera Rubin NVL144 planned for the second half of 2026 and Rubin Ultra NVL576 on track to launch in 2027 . NVIDIA also unveiled its its Blackwell RTX Pro to turbocharge AI workstations servers and laptops and trotted out its Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU with 288GB of HBM3e memory on a single package . The latter solution paves the way for 20TB of HBM3e on a rack of Blackwell Ultra GB300 aa such as NVIDIAs GB300 NVL72 and a monstrous 1.1 exaFLOPS of FP4 compute . Do you think there will be any big announcements made at GTC 2026"

I see this as an investment that has lower risk but good potential in relation to Mag7 and the “ AI companies ” that need data centers .

Long-term horizon (5–10 years), not trading.

      "selftext": "Silver has surged so much that one ounce of silver now costs more than a barrel of crude oil, which is historically unusual. This isn’t happening just because oil is cheap; it’s mainly because silver demand has exploded. Global silver production has failed to keep pace with demand, creating severe supply tightness. Most silver is mined as a by-product of other metals, so even at higher prices, supply cannot be increased quickly or easily. At the same time, industrial demand for silver is extremely strong. The metal is heavily used in solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics, batteries, and AI-related technology. Industrial users are now competing directly with investors for physical silver, further tightening the market. Investment demand has also surged. Many investors are moving into silver as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, while others see it as a leveraged play on gold. Increased buying through ETFs and futures markets has reduced the amount of available silver even further.",

This isn ’ t happening just because oil is cheap it ’ s mainly because silver demand has exploded . Global silver production has failed to keep pace with demand creating severe supply tightness . Most silver is mined as a byproduct of other metals so even at higher prices supply can not be increased quickly or easily . At the same time industrial demand for silver is extremely strong . The metal is heavily used in solar panels electric vehicles electronics batteries and AIrelated technology . Industrial users are now competing directly with investors for physical silver further tightening the market . Investment demand has also surged . Many investors are moving into silver as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement while others see it as a leveraged play on gold . Increased buying through ETFs and futures markets has reduced the amount of available silver even further ."

      "selftext": "I want some honest advice on holding this portfolio for 20+ years. My thesis is basically that these larger tech companies will consume their unfair share of value creation over the next decade, especially as AI, Robotics and Space become more established industries. I also think they are safe long term individual holds as I cant see these companies going out of business (even just considering their balance sheets). I can’t convince myself that international or small/mid caps will outperform the top 500 companies in the US long term with what I think is coming from a technology perspective. I know there is risk to this portfolio and I am not that concerned about drawdowns as I should have the income to sustain my lifestyle. My hope is that long term holding of this portfolio will set me up very well into retirement and give me incredible assets to pass down to my future generations. I don’t really have anyone to stress test this thesis with in an educated way so I wanted to post here and see what others think about this. It's worth mentioning that a lot of these holdings are very much \"in the green\" from a cost basis perspective. My plan over the foreseeable future is to continue putting money into retirement accounts up to the max, allocate \\~100K or so towards S&P500 exposure in my investment account per year for as long as I can, and then allocate another 20K investment towards SpaceX when they IPO. I want to let the individual holdings sit for a long time before considering rebalancing or trimming. What am I missing or what do I have wrong? Do I have too much recency bias in my holdings if I intend for them to be long term assets? When I am 50 will this turn me into a multi millionaire or leave me wishing I had more diversity? |Account|**Balance**|**Portfolio** **Weight**| |:-|:-|:-| |Robinhood (Tech Stocks + S&P 500)|$328,149|50.13%| |Crypto (Bitcoin)|$133,507|20.40%| |401K (S&P 500)|$120,031|18.34%| |IRA (S&P 500)|$36,496|5.58%| |Roth IRA (S&P 500)|$27,935|4.27%| |HSA (S&P 500)|$7,299|1.12%| |Roth 401K (S&P 500)|$1,161|0.18%| |**Total**|**$654,579**|**100.00%**| |Holding|**Total Balance**|**Portfolio Weight**| |:-|:-|:-| |S&P 500|$257,091|39.28%| |Bitcoin|$133,507|20.40%| |Tesla|$44,763|6.84%| |Alphabet|$37,954|5.80%| |Cash|$37,007|5.65%| |NVIDIA|$35,868|5.48%| |Amazon|$24,445|3.73%| |Apple|$23,136|3.53%| |Microsoft|$22,974|3.51%| |Meta|$19,023|2.91%| |TSMC|$18,811|2.87%| |**Total**|**$654,579**|**100.00%**|",

      "selftext_processed": "I want some honest advice on holding this portfolio for 20 years . My thesis is basically that these larger tech companies will consume their unfair share of value creation over the next decade especially as AI Robotics and Space become more established industries . I also think they are safe long term individual holds as I cant see these companies going out of business even just considering their balance sheets . I can ’ t convince myself that international or smallmid caps will outperform the top 500 companies in the US long term with what I think is coming from a technology perspective . I know there is risk to this portfolio and I am not_that concerned about drawdowns as I should have the income to sustain my lifestyle . My hope is that long term holding of this portfolio will set me up very well into retirement and give me incredible assets to pass down to my future generations . I don ’ t really have anyone to stress test this thesis with in an educated way so I wanted to post here and see what others think about this . Its worth mentioning that a lot of these holdings are very much in the green from a cost basis perspective . My plan over the foreseeable future is to continue putting money into retirement accounts up to the max allocate 100K or so towards SP500 exposure in my investment account per year for as long as I can and then allocate another 20K investment towards SpaceX when they IPO . I want to let the individual holdings sit for a long time before considering rebalancing or trimming . What am I missing or what do I have wrong Do I have too much recency bias in my holdings if I intend for them to be long term assets When I am 50 will this turn me into a multi millionaire or leave me wishing I had more diversity AccountBalancePortfolio Weight Robinhood Tech Stocks SP 500 $ 32814950.13 % Crypto Bitcoin $ 13350720.40 % 401K SP 500 $ 12003118.34 % IRA SP 500 $ 364965.58 % Roth IRA SP 500 $ 279354.27 % HSA SP 500 $ 72991.12 % Roth 401K SP 500 $ 11610.18 % Total $ 654579100.00 % HoldingTotal BalancePortfolio Weight SP 500 $ 25709139.28 % Bitcoin $ 13350720.40 % Tesla $ 447636.84 % Alphabet $ 379545.80 % Cash $ 370075.65 % NVIDIA $ 358685.48 % Amazon $ 244453.73 % Apple $ 231363.53 % Microsoft $ 229743.51 % Meta $ 190232.91 % TSMC $ 188112.87 % Total $ 654579100.00 %"

I have been pretty disciplined so far, saving a lot and mainly investing in VOO with a little bit in other tech but was wondering after passing the 500k milestone given my age if it makes sense to be more risky. Currently my portfolio is as such \\* GOOGL: \\~$120k \\* Other Big Tech (AAPL, AMZN, META): \\~$15k \\* VOO / VFFSX (401k): \\~$400k \\* Cash: \\~$15k Instead of continuing to strictly only invest in S&P 500, I’m considering shifting some of the VOO weight into QQQM for more tech exposure and also investing into more individual plays I actually believe in such as ASTS, RDDT, ONDS, and TE. Is it crazy for to move from this strictly VOO/chill strategy when I’m already on a good trajectory? If I start buying these higher-risk/growth stocks, should I keep that in my taxable brokerage or try to keep it in my Roth/IRA? (Thinking about the tax implications if one of these actually moons). Thanks for any advice!",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone. My portfolio has been very aggressive with 70% QQQM and 30% BTC for the last six years, and it has performed very well. However, now that I’ve reached pretty large sum and started thinking more seriously about long-term risk, I’m seeing less and less sense in staying fully concentrated in QQQM and BTC. I decided to build a new portfolio and after reading many articles I became interested in factor investing. I’m planning to hold this portfolio long term (30 years). Here’s what I came up with: US (50%) \\- VOO: 20% (Blend) — 99 / 1 / 0 \\- SPMO: 10% (Momentum) — 100 / 0 / 0 \\- XMMO: 10% (Momentum + Size) — 55 / 44 / 0 \\- AVUV: 10% (Value + Size) — 0 / 58 / 42 International Developed (20%) \\- IDMO: 10% (Momentum) — 92 / 5 / 0 \\- AVDV: 10% (Value + Size) — 1 / 44 / 54 International Emerging (20%) \\- AVEM: 10% (Blend) — 62 / 25 / 13 \\- AVES: 10% (Value) — 46 / 32 / 21 Speculative (10%) \\- FBTC: 5% \\- Pre IPO companies: 5% \\* After the dash, I listed size exposure (Large / Mid / Small caps) in percentages. Things I’m unsure about: \\- Should I keep VOO, or move fully into Momentum and Value? \\- Does it make sense to keep XMMO, given that it has the highest expense ratio (0.35%) of all the ETFs listed? \\- Should I replace SPMO and XMMO with a single momentum fund like VFMO with ER 0.13%, which has Large / Mid / Small exposure of 56 / 21 / 22? It defiantly painful to watch how VFMO (combined momentum in small, mid, large) underperform VOO but I guess it is part of factor investment. \\- Should I add AVDE (cap ratio 67 / 24 / 9) to International Developed and split equally between it and IDMO? \\- I feel like AVEM overlaps too much with AVES, but I’m not sure what a better alternative would be. Momentum strategies don’t seem to work well in emerging markets (e.g., EEMO). Another option could be AVEE (size tilt, 0 / 23 / 77). \\- I feel the portfolio has too little exposure to Value (30%). In theory, Value should be one of the best-performing assets over the long run (30 years). Should I increase my allocation at least for US Value (AVUV)? I still want to have some top companies that not always be in SPMO but presented in VOO. Same with AVEM it has companies I want to own that AVES and AVEE do not have. \\- I also found multi-factor rotational funds (DYNF, PALC, OMFL) but not sure what to think about them Overall, I feel that while momentum is nice to have, I still want consistent exposure to big tech, so I need to have VOO as well. Any other advice is really appreciated. Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone . My portfolio has been very aggressive with 70 % QQQM and 30 % BTC for the last six years and it has performed very well . However now that I ’ ve reached pretty large sum and started thinking more seriously about longterm risk I ’ m seeing less and less sense in staying fully concentrated in QQQM and BTC . I decided to build a new portfolio and after reading many articles I became interested in factor investing . I ’ m planning to hold this portfolio long term 30 years . Here ’ s what I came up with US 50 % VOO 20 % Blend — 99 1 0 SPMO 10 % Momentum — 100 0 0 XMMO 10 % Momentum Size — 55 44 0 AVUV 10 % Value Size — 0 58 42 International Developed 20 % IDMO 10 % Momentum — 92 5 0 AVDV 10 % Value Size — 1 44 54 International Emerging 20 % AVEM 10 % Blend — 62 25 13 AVES 10 % Value — 46 32 21 Speculative 10 % FBTC 5 % Pre IPO companies 5 % After the dash I listed size exposure Large Mid Small caps in percentages . Things I ’ m unsure about Should I keep VOO or move fully into Momentum and Value Does it make sense to keep XMMO given that it has the highest expense ratio 0.35 % of all the ETFs listed Should I replace SPMO and XMMO with a single momentum fund like VFMO with ER 0.13 % which has Large Mid Small exposure of 56 21 22 It defiantly painful to watch how VFMO combined momentum in small mid large underperform VOO but I guess it is part of factor investment . Should I add AVDE cap ratio 67 24 9 to International Developed and split equally between it and IDMO I feel like AVEM overlaps too much with AVES but I ’ m not_sure what a better alternative would be . Momentum strategies don ’ t seem to work well in emerging markets e.g . EEMO . Another option could be AVEE size tilt 0 23 77 . I feel the portfolio has too little exposure to Value 30 % . In theory Value should be one of the bestperforming assets over the long run 30 years . Should I increase my allocation at least for US Value AVUV I still want to have some top companies that not_always be in SPMO but presented in VOO . Same with AVEM it has companies I want to own that AVES and AVEE do not_have . I also found multifactor rotational funds DYNF PALC OMFL but not_sure what to think about them Overall I feel that while momentum is nice to have I still want consistent exposure to big tech so I need to have VOO as well . Any other advice is really appreciated . Thanks"

      "selftext": "Been thinking about this variation on buy-low-sell-high for a while, and wondering if someone here can help. I give as much as I can to various charities and causes. Not rich enough to be in a high tax bracket, but enough that giving tax-efficiently helps. Since I don't have the nerve for stock trading, I'm mostly in boring sector funds and such. So it's rare that I have significantly appreciated assets to give away. I'm wondering if there could be (or already is) a fund with a portfolio whose components swing widely, but on net do no worse than the market. Then the investor can store money there, giving away whatever's made the best gains in any given year, and wait for the rest to go through ups and downs. Does this make sense at all? Is anyone already doing it? . . . OK, either this is a silly, impractical or redundant idea, or I'm expressing it poorly. The motivation: one might be fortunate to be able to donate to a 501(c)(30 or other qualified charity more than the current $108k tax-free limit from savings, payouts, a home sale, whatever. Or one might like to make smaller donations in any given year, but have no highly appreciated assets that could be donated directly, avoiding capital gains. And there are circumstances where one large gift might have much more impact than multiple smaller ones spread over several years. So I'm asking if there is some kind of managed investment portfolio designed for large swings but net general asset preservation with modest growth. Then there would often be some asset with high short-term gains that could be \"harvested\" for tax-efficient donation, while other components are bouncing up and down. No, I'm not any kind of finance expert, or even very interested in money management and investing. But I am committed to giving away most of what I have, to the benefit of a variety of worthy causes, and am seeking ways to do that when it's needed rather than when convenient for me, and as tax-efficiently as possible. Apologies if this is an unworthy question; if so, I'll delete it.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone. Been doing some huge discovery of what I want a 10 year strategy to be. Here is my idea, let me know what You guys think. So say I have 55k. I buy 1000 shares of QQQI at 54.60 Currently a Jan 16 55 call is going for $0.35 or Feb 20 55 call for 0.60 cents. So, I buy the 1000 shares, and I sell covered calls. The covered calls could add about 0.5-0.7% every month. I will not let these calls assign, this is because I want to collect the monthly payout (13.5% yearly paid monthly) every month without a skip. So, if QQQI drifts up, I roll the covered calls forward and up for break even or a small credit. If QQQI goes down I let call expire and sell another one. Reinvesting the monthly payout and the premium from the covered calls back into QQQI will really help this position compound. At the same time, I can sell puts secured by my portfolio, on stocks I want to own. Small Amounts though. I’d be looking for another 0.7-1%/month yield on the portfolio from cash secured puts. I’d then use the put premiums to make positions in equity stocks. The QQQI would be held in tax free accounts the cash secured puts would be sold in my taxable account (Canada) If you are picking up what I am putting down, what is the drawback to this? I am estimating I could get a 25%+ yield as long as I properly manage the secured puts and follow very strict rules on them.",

Industrial buyers in China are the main buyers on the Shanghai exchange, whereas comex or LMBA, despite whatever they say, have functioned for a long time as a way for traders to speculate on price without actually getting delivery of real, physical silver bars. There are hundreds of times more paper ounces of silver than real silver in their vaults. The exchanges make a lot of money being the exchange for that paper. One way that LMBA and comex have prevented the price of silver from getting out of control or prevented a stampede for everyone asking for delivery is hiking up margin requirements. That is what killed the Hunt brothers. For a more recent game played, remember when market clearinghouses basically made all the brokers turn off the buy button for GME? However, the existence of the Shanghai exchange allows for price arbitrage if the price goes up, and they buyers in Shanghai are buying not on margin or for speculation. They need it to make money. Ideally, the price in the west should go up to meet the price in the east because of trading arbitrage (for comparison, look up SBF and the kimchi premium and how much money he made from a concept so simple, even if execution was a challenge). However, if the demand in Shanghai cannot be easily met by draining the vaults in London and New York, the spread will persist, as we have seen for the past few days. And it cannot be fixed by lowering the price in the west. That will only cause the silver drain to happen faster and eventually severely hurt the credibility of western exchanges, which already looked bad with the LME nickel debacle. What happens here? Pull out your crayons and start learning about fib extensions for rough price targets OR follow the gold to silver ratio IN ADDITION to watching gold momentum and price. In a precious metals bull market, silver over the long term should keep moving as long as gold is in bull mode. If you are a fool who doesn’t believe in technical analysis, sorry, but you are SOL. The spread between the western and eastern price can widen. In many ways, a $2 spread is just as irrational and disconnected as a $10 spread. AndI don’t recommend jumping in front of a moving train just because us silver investors or speculators are making noise. It’s a 45 year cup and handle. It’s not going to play out in the just one year unless that one year precludes or includes massive, massive hyperinflation on Argentina levels. Show anybody from Argentina the chart of silver in USD and ask them what they think of it and you will probably see it looks a lot like it did in the beginning of hyperinflation in Argentinian pesos. But old timer silver and goldbugs will also tell you we are due for that so 🤷‍♂️ . Regarding silver miners not following silver: 1. ⁠the tsx and asx have been closed. How many US major primary silver miners or significant silver producers have the NYSE on as it’s home exchange? Coeur mining maybe? Can’t even think of a second. US just doesn’t have a good exchange for small to mid cap mining. 2. ⁠Stocks are different from commodities. Commodities will trade a lot more in line with physical demand and supply. They can get more easily unanchored from the technicals in a lot of scenarios. Sometimes, stocks need to consolidate at resistance. 3. ⁠Call wall for SILJ at $30 strike. 4. ⁠Christmas week is mostly retail, and lots of people don’t understand what is really happening. This is not a margin fueled frenzy like with the Hunt brothers. This is primary demand from China for industrial purposes and the comex and LMBA cannot make prices go down by shutting off the buy button or hiking margin requirements. In fact, lowering the price just makes the problem of physical shortages worse because traders can get physical silver from the west at a discount and sell it at a premium in China. Since the average retail investor has no clue what is happening, they are going to expect a spike up and a spike down in the silver price. Miners don’t make money from spikes. They need higher for longer because they have their volumes of output over time. However, once better connected institutions come back from holiday get wind of what is happening in China, we will see what they do. I’d like to pose to everyone reading this a question posed by Eric Yeung on twitter: If the comex and LMBA are sucked dry of silver and exposed for not being reliable sources of physical silver, and SLV is caught having paper instead of physical silver (disclaimer: that’s a speculation. I and others believe it to be true but can’t prove it), then the miners and PSLV are the only way for investors to get real exposure to silver on the NYSE. What happens then? A side note: silver follows gold. Know what else tends to follow gold? a three letter word beginning with OIL and ending with OIL. We (the US) are at risk of invading Venezuela for oil at a time when oil is $60/barrel. That’s only a smart move if you are fixing a crisis now or if you see a crisis coming, and current prices are not a crisis. Dunno how to spell that out more clearly.",

      "selftext_processed": "What is happening I want to address the nature of the sharp rise in silver . Some of it is SLV shorts getting liquidated . That is only a smaller part . the main difference between now and what happened with the Hunt brothers is the Shanghai exchange which isa primarily physical market compared to the comex or LMBA which are more paper markets . Industrial buyers in China are the main buyers on the Shanghai exchange whereas comex or LMBA despite whatever they say have functioned for a long time as a way for traders to speculate on price without actually getting delivery of real physical silver bars . There are hundreds of times more paper ounces of silver than real silver in their vaults . The exchanges make a lot of money being the exchange for that paper . One way that LMBA and comex have prevented the price of silver from getting out of control or prevented a stampede for everyone asking for delivery is hiking up margin requirements . That is what killed the Hunt brothers . For a more recent game played remember when market clearinghouses basically made all the brokers turn off the buy button for GME However the existence of the Shanghai exchange allows for price arbitrage if the price goes up and they buyers in Shanghai are buying not_on margin or for speculation . They need it to make money . Ideally the price in the west should go up to meet the price in the east because of trading arbitrage for comparison look up SBF and the kimchi premium and how much money he made from a concept so simple even if execution was a challenge . However if the demand in Shanghai can not be easily met by draining the vaults in London and New York the spread will persist as we have seen for the past few days . And it can not be fixed by lowering the price in the west . That will only cause the silver drain to happen faster and eventually severely hurt the credibility of western exchanges which already looked bad with the LME nickel debacle . What happens here Pull out your crayons and start learning about fib extensions for rough price targets OR follow the gold to silver ratio IN ADDITION to watching gold momentum and price . In a precious metals bull market silver over the long term should keep moving as long as gold is in bull mode . If you are a fool who doesn ’ t believe in technical analysis sorry but you are SOL . The spread between the western and eastern price can widen . In many ways a $ 2 spread is just as irrational and disconnected as a $ 10 spread . AndI don ’ t recommend jumping in front of a moving train just because us silver investors or speculators are making noise . It ’ s a 45 year cup and handle . It ’ s not_going to play out in the just one year unless that one year precludes or includes massive massive hyperinflation on Argentina levels . Show anybody from Argentina the chart of silver in USD and ask them what they think of it and you will probably see it looks a lot like it did in the beginning of hyperinflation in Argentinian pesos . But old timer silver and goldbugs will also tell you we are due for that so 🤷‍♂️ . Regarding silver miners not_following silver 1 . ⁠the tsx and asx have been closed . How many US major primary silver miners or significant silver producers have the NYSE on as it ’ s home exchange Coeur mining maybe Can ’ t even think of a second . US just doesn ’ t have a good exchange for small to mid cap mining . 2 . ⁠Stocks are different from commodities . Commodities will trade a lot more in line with physical demand and supply . They can get more easily unanchored from the technicals in a lot of scenarios . Sometimes stocks need to consolidate at resistance . 3 . ⁠Call wall for SILJ at $ 30 strike . 4 . ⁠Christmas week is mostly retail and lots of people don ’ t understand what is really happening . This is not_a margin fueled frenzy like with the Hunt brothers . This is primary demand from China for industrial purposes and the comex and LMBA can not make prices go down by shutting off the buy button or hiking margin requirements . In fact lowering the price just makes the problem of physical shortages worse because traders can get physical silver from the west at a discount and sell it at a premium in China . Since the average retail investor has no_clue what is happening they are going to expect a spike up and a spike down in the silver price . Miners don ’ t make money from spikes . They need higher for longer because they have their volumes of output over time . However once better connected institutions come back from holiday get wind of what is happening in China we will see what they do . I ’ d like to pose to everyone reading this a question posed by Eric Yeung on twitter If the comex and LMBA are sucked dry of silver and exposed for not_being reliable sources of physical silver and SLV is caught having paper instead of physical silver disclaimer that ’ s a speculation . I and others believe it to be true but can ’ t prove it then the miners and PSLV are the only way for investors to get real exposure to silver on the NYSE . What happens then A side note silver follows gold . Know what else tends to follow gold a three letter word beginning with OIL and ending with OIL . We the US are at risk of invading Venezuela for oil at a time when oil is $ 60barrel . That ’ s only a smart move if you are fixing a crisis now or if you see a crisis coming and current prices are not_a crisis . Dunno how to spell that out more clearly ."

      "selftext": "“We envision future NVDA platforms where GPU and LPU co-exist in a rack, connected seamlessly with NVDA’s NVLInk networking fabric. Groq’s LPU employ a large amount (hundreds of MB) of fast on-chip SRAM memory as primary storage for AI model weights and working data,” wrote Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya to clients in a research note shared with me. “Longer-term, we think the potential Groq deal could be strategic, similar to NVDA’s Apr’20 Mellanox acquisition that is now the foundation of NVDA’s networking/AI scaling moat.” The deal may help Nvidia technology work even better at AI inference. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks inference will be a much bigger market than training AI models, driving substantially more demand for infrastructure, including its chips, software, and networking gear. “The amount of computation necessary to do that reasoning process is 100 times more than what we used to do,” Huang told CNBC earlier this year. “On Dec. 9, Guilfoyle said Nvidia had “survived a short-term sell-off,” prompting him to put a $225 stock price target on its shares. Nvidia’s shares have strengthened since then, leading him to update his thinking. “The shares are engaged in an attempt to take and hold the $188​ pivot created by the newly formed bullish double bottom pattern,” wrote Guilfoyle. “The stock’s reading for relative strength and its daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence are both also in a better place at this time.” Guilfoyle’s new Nvidia stock target: $235.” Tbh I think Nvda can go higher than 235 before eoy 2026. Thoughts? Why or why not?",

      "selftext": "Okay listen up here bros. First of all, no I am not trying to pump my “bags”. Even if all of you brokies liquidated everything and went into CNQ on Monday at open, it wouldn’t move it a needle. With that being said, I know you are all busy chasing shiny metals right now but going into 2026, I believe that energy equities could outperform. Oil has pretty much been eating shit all year and is currently sitting at around $55 (crude). Yes, an entire barrel of oil is now cheaper than an ounce of silver. Read that again. Can it go lower? Sure. Is it sustainable? No. I think in hindsight, this will have been obvious. Sometimes, things are cheap enough. Why am I bullish on oil? Well, I listen to and read a lot of what old and rich boomers have to say when I am bored and a lot of them seem to be bullish on it. I will try to keep this short and concise. In no particular order : 1. The massive \"supply glut\" is overstated and demand is not as weak as forecasted either. Even the IEA which have been historically bearish recently moved their goalpost on peak oil demand from 2030 to 2050 (not that IEA has any real credibility. They have been wrong on their oil demand forecasts for like 17 years in a row). 2. Most of the world's oil supply growth since the shale revolution came from US shale. There is real evidence that suggest that shale production has peaked (or is close). Their best assets are facing major depletion and at current oil prices, contrary to what the Mango man wants, their production will not be growing. 3. XLE makes up less than 3% of SPY. Just going back to the historical average of 6\\~8% would imply massive gains for the equities. The bullish case is not necessairly dependent on crude hitting $100. 4. Seasonality. Crude typically has strong seasonality in Q1. 5. Any geopolitical risks are just a bonus at this point. One of my favorite boomers to listen to, Rick Rule, says that you don't need to go far down the quality trail when it comes to oil equities. He thinks XOM is selling at 60% of NPV, meaning at 40% discount. I'm personally all in on CNQ which is a Canadian oil sands giant. The Canadian O&G stocks trade at an even further discount to the US peers because of our political incompetence but Carney is a smart man and understands how important our oil and gas sector is to our economy and I'm betting that he will enable them. He has already reversed some of the Trudeau era policies and I think this is why they have been outperforming the US O&G names. I'm also Canadian myself and there are tax advantages for holding TSX stocks. Here’s some random tickers to consider since a rising tide lifts all boats. XOM / CVX / COP / CNQ / SU / OXY / DVN Anyways, that's it for now. I'm off to play some poker. See you degens on Monday.",

Even if all of you brokies liquidated everything and went into CNQ on Monday at open it wouldn ’ t move it a needle . With that being said I know you are all busy chasing shiny metals right now but going into 2026 I believe that energy equities could outperform . Oil has pretty much been eating shit all year and is currently sitting at around $ 55 crude . Yes an entire barrel of oil is now cheaper than an ounce of silver . Read that again . Can it go lower Sure . Is it sustainable No_I think in hindsight this will have been obvious . Sometimes things are cheap enough . Why am I bullish on oil Well I listen to and read a lot of what old and rich boomers have to say when I am bored and a lot of them seem to be bullish on it . I will try to keep this short and concise . In no_particular order 1 . The massive supply glut is overstated and demand is not_as weak as forecasted either . Even the IEA which have been historically bearish recently moved their goalpost on peak oil demand from 2030 to 2050 not that IEA has any real credibility . They have been wrong on their oil demand forecasts for like 17 years in a row . 2 . Most of the worlds oil supply growth since the shale revolution came from US shale . There is real evidence that suggest that shale production has peaked or is close . Their best assets are facing major depletion and at current oil prices contrary to what the Mango man wants their production will not_be growing . 3 . XLE makes up less than 3 % of SPY . Just going back to the historical average of 68 % would imply massive gains for the equities . The bullish case is not_necessairly dependent on crude hitting $ 100 . 4 . Seasonality . Crude typically has strong seasonality in Q1 . 5 . Any geopolitical risks are just a bonus at this point . One of my favorite boomers to listen to Rick Rule says that you dont need to go far down the quality trail when it comes to oil equities . He thinks XOM is selling at 60 % of NPV meaning at 40 % discount . Im personally all in on CNQ which is a Canadian oil sands giant . The Canadian OG stocks trade at an even further discount to the US peers because of our political incompetence but Carney is a smart man and understands how important our oil and gas sector is to our economy and Im betting that he will enable them . He has already reversed some of the Trudeau era policies and I think this is why they have been outperforming the US OG names . Im also Canadian myself and there are tax advantages for holding TSX stocks . Here ’ s some random tickers to consider since a rising tide lifts all boats . XOM CVX COP CNQ SU OXY DVN Anyways thats it for now . Im off to play some poker . See you degens on Monday ."

      "selftext": "Picked up some Calls for $NTNX recently and wanted to see what the consensus is at WSB on the Stock. They had a decent quarter, ARR, Revenue and earnings growth but missed hard on the guidance cutting the stock price. I work in tech nationally. Every company that I talk to (from regional banks and trucking companies to global casinos and the largest retailer on the planet) are switching from VMWare to Nutanix. Broadcom has destroyed VMware and raised the prices killing off the lifetime license model and forcing upgrades - they’re bleeding customers now. The only truly viable competition is to go hypervisor and that’s really only for MS customers who are only MS. This feels like a long-term win, but I wanted to go check it here. What are you seeing beyond the headlines how do you think the stock will do?",

They had a decent quarter ARR Revenue and earnings growth but missed hard on the guidance cutting the stock price . I work in tech nationally . Every company that I talk to from regional banks and trucking companies to global casinos and the largest retailer on the planet are switching from VMWare to Nutanix . Broadcom has destroyed VMware and raised the prices killing off the lifetime license model and forcing upgrades they ’ re bleeding customers now . The only truly viable competition is to go hypervisor and that ’ s really only for MS customers who are only MS . This feels like a longterm win but I wanted to go check it here . What are you seeing beyond the headlines how do you think the stock will do"

      "selftext": "I reckon the market is richly valued, concentrated in U.S. growth, and probably on the brink of a substantial correction. But I'm also worried about bonds. Treasuries are becoming an alarming credit risk, TIPS are based on dubious inflation calculations, corporates pay a low premium, and other reliable nations have debt problems just as bad. I'm neutral on real estate and emerging markets, but regard them as distinct supporting players for the allocation, so it's hard to lean on them more. I don't mind keeping some cash to exploit a near-term correction, but mindful of upside risk in the meantime. Gold and crypto are not for me. Port consists of mainly static IRAs with my life's savings. There's a modest RMD, and my earning potential has tanked in my mid 50s. Strategy mix is more active than passive. I've conceded some gains to mitigate risk, but still see risk compounding everywhere I look, and my tolerance isn't getting any higher. Here's where I'm at: * Emerging 6% * Foreign 25% * Domestic (value) 17% * REITs 12% * Bonds 10% * TIPS 9% * Treasuries 11% * Cash 10% Basically a moderate 65/35 port with a bias toward foreign, value, and cash. Is this the best I can do?",

Im neutral on real estate and emerging markets but regard them as distinct supporting players for the allocation so its hard to lean on them more .

      "selftext": "Everyone is investing more and more money in solar panels, electric cars, electronics and other such things, but everyone forgets that the increase in the price of silver has a negative impact on the industry. Higher prices, less profit. Key Industries Affected Renewable Energy: Silver is a crucial component in solar panels, and accelerating global clean energy adoption means demand in this sector is high. Electronics & Technology: Its unmatched electrical and thermal conductivity makes it indispensable in semiconductors, 5G networks, and general electronics infrastructure. Automotive: Electric vehicles require a significantly higher amount of silver per unit compared to traditional vehicles, primarily for their power systems and sensors. Not yet, but we will probably see a negative impact after the first or second quarter results. So, is anyone thinking in a long term and will do some stocks rotation?",

Electronics Technology Its unmatched electrical and thermal conductivity makes it indispensable in semiconductors 5G networks and general electronics infrastructure . Automotive Electric vehicles require a significantly higher amount of silver per unit compared to traditional vehicles primarily for their power systems and sensors .

      "selftext": "As of late 2025, the transition from AI hype to infrastructure utility has made power availability a primary constraint for the Mag7, which has been highlighted repeatedly in numerous mag7 investor calls and more importantly evidenced in their drive to supply some of their own energy (i.e. solar panel initiatives & expenditure, Amazon hydrogen electrolysers). Big Tech is showing clear focus to source backup power, and critically stable baseload \"clean firm\" power to sustain massive data centre clusters. In my previous DD I outlined how in particular amongst the energy sector players (CEG, NRG, D, DUK) Viagra stood out for me. Vistra Corp (VST) is solidifying its role in this transition, highlighted by a 20-year PPA for 1,200 MW at its Comanche Peak nuclear plant. This deal, coupled with a December 12 upgrade to Investment Grade (BBB-) by S&P Global, provides the locked-in cash flow required for large-scale expansion. Example in point, September 2025, Vistra approved a $1 billion internal development project to triple the size of its existing Permian Basin Power Plant in Texas to erect 860 MW of new advanced gas units. Falling interest rates act as a refinancing benefit and encourage further USA widespread tech and industrial Capex and expenditure, leading to future elevated energy demand. Vistra holds a unique advantage by dominating the PJM and ERCOT markets. Texas (ERCOT) remains the top destination for manufacturing reshoring and the second-largest data center pipeline, allowing Vistra to capture high \"scarcity rents\" via its gas and solar fleet. In the PJM \"Data Center Alley,\" Vistra’s Energy Harbor assets provide critical nuclear baseload. A landmark FERC order on December 18, 2025, cleared the path for data center co-location, allowing hyperscalers to bypass five-year grid connection queues by connecting \"behind the meter\" directly to Vistra’s plants. Vistra is set to benefit from increasing tailwinds in AI demand, reshoring, and general increase in electrification. Regulated utilities like Dominion or Duke are capped by rate-base expansion, but Vistra operates in wholesale markets where structural scarcity translates immediately into higher realized prices. Constellation (CEG) wins on nuclear purity, yet Vistra offers superior earnings torque and margination. When grid conditions tighten in PJM or ERCOT, Vistra’s generation supply range of nuclear and gas allows higher spark spreads to flow directly to the bottom line, providing faster growth than traditional peers by using most efficient margin selection. **Fundamental Metrics** The current fundamental landscape for the three leaders is defined by the following live metrics (as of Dec 26, 2025): * Vistra (VST): Price ~$161.70. Forward P/E ~12-14x, EV/EBITDA ~14.3x, ROE ~22.6%. 2026 EBITDA guidance initiated at $6.8B–$7.6B. High asymmetry as the market begins pricing ERCOT scarcity as a structural constant rather than a seasonal cycle. Zack's stock analysis firm quotes \"VST’s trailing 12-month return on equity (“ROE”) is 64.04%, way ahead of its industry average of 9.84%. VST’s better ROE than its industry indicates that the company is utilizing its funds more efficiently than its industry peers to generate returns.\" * Constellation (CEG): Price ~$360.46. Forward P/E ~41.6x, EV/EBITDA ~21.5x, ROE ~20.3%. Nuclear scarcity commands a premium, with the market pricing in long-term \"clean firm\" contracts like the Microsoft/TMI restart. * NRG Energy (NRG): Price ~$160.81. Forward P/E ~22.8x, P/S ~1.09x, ROE ~60.6% (driven by aggressive buybacks). Reaffirmed 2025 EBITDA of $3.9B–$4.0B. Operates as a flexible \"reliability provider\" with high sensitivity to gas-spark spreads. **Technical movement** Financially, Vistra appears to be attempting a bottoming and consolidating from recent highs near $220, with reduced volume on red days, and choppy sideways range trading and higher lows. A December pull-back to the $160 range cleared out significant short-term speculators, leaving a shareholder base that is now 91% institutional. Put to Call volume shows significant hedging and Put bias, with Max pain in December and January floating between $160-$180 depending on expiry. Movements above $165 are likely to trigger a squeeze to $180 levels. **Institutional signals** Institutional investment is increasing AND recent, notably JP Morgan increased their VST position to ~10,935,188 shares (buying an additional ~2,074,364 shares, increasing portfolio holding by 23% at an approximated cost basis of $170-180 per share) in Q3 2025. Congressional Records show Nancy Pelosi bought $50 calls with 367 DTE on January 14, 2025, with underlying cost basis approximately $166. There is no disclosure of those positions being sold (which require disclosure) = technically she is still holding open call positions expiring January 2026 at an underlying basis of $166. Breakeven would sit around a throbbing $180. Analysts firmly maintain a majority \"Strong Buy\" and \"Outperform\" consensus, citing Vistra’s strong 2026 trajectory. With average price targets at $243 and high-end estimates reaching $295, the current technicals are giving hints of a potential valuation re-rating as Vistra continues to aggressively expand as a core AI/infra/industry Energy infrastructure play. **Recent downturn** Two EPS misses, have sent VST into a correction. GAAP revenue misses have been largely an accounting Mark-to-Market derivative accounting write-off, rather than a fundamental business downturn, with YoY revenue, profit margins, EBITDA all increasing. Q3 showed slight softening due to unplanned outages which do not appear to feature in latest investor calls and A&A. Looking forward at Q4 and EPS Beat/Meet/Miss probabilities: Vistra’s (VST) Q4 2025 earnings outlook projects 114% YoY EPS surge to $2.45 and $5.5B–$6.0B in revenue, supported by a 6% generation increase to ~51,000 GWh following the 2,600 MW Lotus acquisition. The 7% colder-than-normal winter and record PJM capacity pricing act as tailwinds, although 2% reduced commercial availability (down from 95%) and weak retail remain risks. A high probability of an EBITDA and FCF beat ($3.3B–$3.5B guidance) is bolstered by Nuclear Production Tax Credits and a 30% share reduction since 2021, though GAAP revenue may be subject to mark-to-market derivative accounting again. $3.7B in liquidity and 100% of 2025 volumes hedged, mass growth is going to be largely driven by new contracts both finalised and future. Probabilities sit at: Beat: 65% Meat: 25% Miss: 10% *Disclaimer;* Not financial advice. I hold a position and am likely to add more on technical signals. This info is majority composed by myself ~70% with AI used to gross-format, and 3 AI models and personal research have been used to check veracity and cross-check information.

      "selftext_processed": "As of late 2025 the transition from AI hype to infrastructure utility has made power availability a primary constraint for the Mag7 which has been highlighted repeatedly in numerous mag7 investor calls and more importantly evidenced in their drive to supply some of their own energy i.e . solar panel initiatives expenditure Amazon hydrogen electrolysers . Big Tech is showing clear focus to source backup power and critically stable baseload clean firm power to sustain massive data centre clusters . In my previous DD I outlined how in particular amongst the energy sector players CEG NRG D DUK Viagra stood out for me . Vistra Corp VST is solidifying its role in this transition highlighted by a 20year PPA for 1200 MW at its Comanche Peak nuclear plant . This deal coupled with a December 12 upgrade to Investment Grade BBB by SP Global provides the lockedin cash flow required for largescale expansion . Example in point September 2025 Vistra approved a $ 1 billion internal development project to triple the size of its existing Permian Basin Power Plant in Texas to erect 860 MW of new advanced gas units . Falling interest rates act as a refinancing benefit and encourage further USA widespread tech and industrial Capex and expenditure leading to future elevated energy demand . Vistra holds a unique advantage by dominating the PJM and ERCOT markets . Texas ERCOT remains the top destination for manufacturing reshoring and the secondlargest data center pipeline allowing Vistra to capture high scarcity rents via its gas and solar fleet . In the PJM Data Center Alley Vistra ’ s Energy Harbor assets provide critical nuclear baseload . A landmark FERC order on December 18 2025 cleared the path for data center colocation allowing hyperscalers to bypass fiveyear grid connection queues by connecting behind the meter directly to Vistra ’ s plants . Vistra is set to benefit from increasing tailwinds in AI demand reshoring and general increase in electrification . Regulated utilities like Dominion or Duke are capped by ratebase expansion but Vistra operates in wholesale markets where structural scarcity translates immediately into higher realized prices . Constellation CEG wins on nuclear purity yet Vistra offers superior earnings torque and margination . When grid conditions tighten in PJM or ERCOT Vistra ’ s generation supply range of nuclear and gas allows higher spark spreads to flow directly to the bottom line providing faster growth than traditional peers by using most efficient margin selection . Fundamental Metrics The current fundamental landscape for the three leaders is defined by the following live metrics as of Dec 26 2025 Vistra VST Price $ 161.70 . Forward PE 1214x EVEBITDA 14.3x ROE 22.6 % . 2026 EBITDA guidance initiated at $ 6.8B– $ 7.6B . High asymmetry as the market begins pricing ERCOT scarcity as a structural constant rather than a seasonal cycle . Zacks stock analysis firm quotes VST ’ s trailing 12month return on equity “ ROE ” is 64.04 % way ahead of its industry average of 9.84 % . VST ’ s better ROE than its industry indicates that the company is utilizing its funds more efficiently than its industry peers to generate returns . Constellation CEG Price $ 360.46 . Forward PE 41.6x EVEBITDA 21.5x ROE 20.3 % . Nuclear scarcity commands a premium with the market pricing in longterm clean firm contracts like the MicrosoftTMI restart . NRG Energy NRG Price $ 160.81 . Forward PE 22.8x PS 1.09x ROE 60.6 % driven by aggressive buybacks . Reaffirmed 2025 EBITDA of $ 3.9B– $ 4.0B . Operates as a flexible reliability provider with high sensitivity to gasspark spreads . Technical movement Financially Vistra appears to be attempting a bottoming and consolidating from recent highs near $ 220 with reduced volume on red days and choppy sideways range trading and higher lows . A December pullback to the $ 160 range cleared out significant shortterm speculators leaving a shareholder base that is now 91 % institutional . Put to Call volume shows significant hedging and Put bias with Max pain in December and January floating between $ 160 $ 180 depending on expiry . Movements above $ 165 are likely to trigger a squeeze to $ 180 levels . Institutional signals Institutional investment is increasing AND recent notably JP Morgan increased their VST position to 10935188 shares buying an additional 2074364 shares increasing portfolio holding by 23 % at an approximated cost basis of $ 170180 per share in Q3 2025 . Congressional Records show Nancy Pelosi bought $ 50 calls with 367 DTE on January 14 2025 with underlying cost basis approximately $ 166 . There is no_disclosure of those positions being sold which require disclosure technically she is still holding open call positions expiring January 2026 at an underlying basis of $ 166 . Breakeven would sit around a throbbing $ 180 . Analysts firmly maintain a majority Strong Buy and Outperform consensus citing Vistra ’ s strong 2026 trajectory . With average price targets at $ 243 and highend estimates reaching $ 295 the current technicals are giving hints of a potential valuation rerating as Vistra continues to aggressively expand as a core AIinfraindustry Energy infrastructure play . Recent downturn Two EPS misses have sent VST into a correction . GAAP revenue misses have been largely an accounting MarktoMarket derivative accounting writeoff rather than a fundamental business downturn with YoY revenue profit margins EBITDA all increasing . Q3 showed slight softening due to unplanned outages which do not_appear to feature in latest investor calls and AA . Looking forward at Q4 and EPS BeatMeetMiss probabilities Vistra ’ s VST Q4 2025 earnings outlook projects 114 % YoY EPS surge to $ 2.45 and $ 5.5B– $ 6.0B in revenue supported by a 6 % generation increase to 51000 GWh following the 2600 MW Lotus acquisition . The 7 % colderthannormal winter and record PJM capacity pricing act as tailwinds although 2 % reduced commercial availability down from 95 % and weak retail remain risks . A high probability of an EBITDA and FCF beat $ 3.3B– $ 3.5B guidance is bolstered by Nuclear Production Tax Credits and a 30 % share reduction since 2021 though GAAP revenue may be subject to marktomarket derivative accounting again . $ 3.7B in liquidity and 100 % of 2025 volumes hedged mass growth is going to be largely driven by new contracts both finalised and future . Probabilities sit at Beat 65 % Meat 25 % Miss 10 % Disclaimer Not_financial advice . I hold a position and am likely to add more on technical signals . This info is majority composed by myself 70 % with AI used to grossformat and 3 AI models and personal research have been used to check veracity and crosscheck information .

      "selftext": "This relating to the Warner Bros/Netflix/Paramount Skydance bidding war. Now I don't know all the details but from what I was told is that Netflix can't raise their hypothetical counterbid to $35 because shareholders are not enthusiastic about getting WB. Is there any truth to this? I've been told but at the same time I don't think it's not really super clear ro me especially with all that's going on or waiting me into asking this question on why did Netflix even want to pursue Warner Bros if there was going to be problems with acquiring Warner Bros, either from regulators or Paramount being stingy about Warner Bros so much that they are launching a hostile takeover and to get Warner Bros to accept their \"SUPERIOR\" offer? This entire thing is driving me up the wall to where I guess I want to know if Netflix shareholders don't really approve acquisition of Warner Bros meaning Netflix isn't going to raise their bid to $35 Paramount does it. Some people treat this like it's a fact but others kind of come off like it's a no or a unsure thing.",

Now I dont know all the details but from what I was told is that Netflix cant raise their hypothetical counterbid to $ 35 because shareholders are not_enthusiastic about getting WB . Is there any truth to this Ive been told but at the same time I dont think its not_really super clear ro me especially with all thats going on or waiting me into asking this question on why did Netflix even want to pursue Warner Bros if there was going to be problems with acquiring Warner Bros either from regulators or Paramount being stingy about Warner Bros so much that they are launching a hostile takeover and to get Warner Bros to accept their SUPERIOR offer This entire thing is driving me up the wall to where I guess I want to know if Netflix shareholders dont really approve acquisition of Warner Bros meaning Netflix isnt going to raise their bid to $ 35 Paramount does it . Some people treat this like its a fact but others kind of come off like its a no_or a unsure thing ."

      "selftext": "I recently took some profits on my TVTX holdings. As I’m considering my next move, I read a 2026 market outlook that really resonated with me, especially the part about the “tug of war between earnings and valuations” While corporate earnings are expected to grow 15% by 2026, the high P/E ratio of 28 could be at risk of contracting. If valuations revert, the overall market gain for the year might end up being only around 5%. Given that tech stocks now make up almost 50% of the index, VOO itself is basically half an “AI fund. With this expectation of “slower growth,” I’m thinking of adjusting my approach a bit. I don’t want to sell all my individual stocks, but I am planning to move some of my profits into VOO. I’ve noticed a lot of people talking about “rotating into VOO” lately. What are your real reasons for doing so? Is it mainly fear of volatility in individual stocks at these highs, or are you also less optimistic about getting outsized returns going forward?",

As I ’ m considering my next move I read a 2026 market outlook that really resonated with me especially the part about the “ tug of war between earnings and valuations ” While corporate earnings are expected to grow 15 % by 2026 the high PE ratio of 28 could be at risk of contracting . If valuations revert the overall market gain for the year might end up being only around 5 % . Given that tech stocks now make up almost 50 % of the index VOO itself is basically half an “ AI fund . With this expectation of “ slower growth ” I ’ m thinking of adjusting my approach a bit . I don ’ t want to sell all my individual stocks but I am planning to move some of my profits into VOO . I ’ ve noticed a lot of people talking about “ rotating into VOO ” lately . What are your real reasons for doing so Is it mainly fear of volatility in individual stocks at these highs or are you also less optimistic about getting outsized returns going forward"

By Q4 2026: BEARISH: * Carvana (CVNA) goes from $440 → $150 BULLISH: * Celsius (CELH) goes from $45 → $80 Two very different directions. **CVNA:** This thing has been resurrected from the dead already. Massive short squeeze, insane multiple expansion, hype + momentum carrying it way past fundamentals. But at some point, margins, debt, used car demand normalization, competition growing will show. On top of that, Hindenburg Research has laid out some serious allegations!!!!!! a lot of people seem to ignore. Their report claims Carvana’s turnaround optics may be overstated, pointing to aggressive accounting, related-party transactions, and what they describe as questionable unit economics masked by financial engineering. Again, these are *allegations*, not proven facts, but they raise real questions about how “clean” the recovery actually is. If growth slows even a little, or if scrutiny increases, CVNA will not get a soft landing. CVNA COULD GO TO ZERO IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING BEHIND THE BOOKS. It was about to go for BK in 2023. not financial advice **CELH:** On the flip side, CELH feels like a long-term consumer brand compounding story. Distribution keeps expanding, international runway is huge, margins improving, and it’s actually profitable. Expect some volatility. $80 by 2026 isn’t crazy if execution stays solid and energy drinks keep stealing share from soda. They are also marketing towards healthy energy, as well as tapping into the female market with Alani Nu. There is a bigger thesis for Celsius but I feel like it is obvious to go deeper. Just buy, compound, and watch it grow. This should overtake Monster in the future.",

Massive short squeeze insane multiple expansion hype momentum carrying it way past fundamentals . But at some point margins debt used car demand normalization competition growing will show . On top of that Hindenburg Research has laid out some serious allegations a lot of people seem to ignore . Their report claims Carvana ’ s turnaround optics may be overstated pointing to aggressive accounting relatedparty transactions and what they describe as questionable unit economics masked by financial engineering . Again these are allegations not_proven facts but they raise real questions about how “ clean ” the recovery actually is . If growth slows even a little or if scrutiny increases CVNA will not_get a soft landing . CVNA COULD GO TO ZERO IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING BEHIND THE BOOKS . It was about to go for BK in 2023. not_financial advice CELH On the flip side CELH feels like a longterm consumer brand compounding story . Distribution keeps expanding international runway is huge margins improving and it ’ s actually profitable . Expect some volatility . $ 80 by 2026 isn ’ t crazy if execution stays solid and energy drinks keep stealing share from soda . They are also marketing towards healthy energy as well as tapping into the female market with Alani Nu . There is a bigger thesis for Celsius but I feel like it is obvious to go deeper . Just buy compound and watch it grow . This should overtake Monster in the future ."

      "selftext": "South Korean memory manufacturers Samsung (SSNLF) and SK Hynix have reportedly raised prices for their fifth generation high bandwidth memory (HBM3E) chips by 20%, with deliveries expected in 2026. The HBM3E price hike comes amid surging demand for advanced memory chips driven by the rise of AI applications. This surge occurs as memory manufacturers prepare to shift resources toward HBM4 chips typically when prices for the previous generation begin to weaken. NVIDIA (NVDA), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have all increased memory requirements for new AI chips. I plan to use $500,000 to steadily increase holdings in Samsung and Nvidia, aiming to complete this plan by January 2026. Do you think holding these positions for 2-3 years could double my investment?",

The HBM3E price hike comes amid surging demand for advanced memory chips driven by the rise of AI applications . This surge occurs as memory manufacturers prepare to shift resources toward HBM4 chips typically when prices for the previous generation begin to weaken . NVIDIA NVDA Google GOOG GOOGL and Amazon AMZN have all increased memory requirements for new AI chips . I plan to use $ 500000 to steadily increase holdings in Samsung and Nvidia aiming to complete this plan by January 2026 . Do you think holding these positions for 23 years could double my investment"

The reasoning for investing in Indian ETF is there is a possibility of me retiring in India in the distant future. I have read that you should have a tilt towards where you will be spending your investment return in the future. For example, VEQT / XEQT / ZEQT have a Canada bias. While FLIN is well established with $2.85B in AUM, IND is brand new (only started in Nov 2025) with AUM of only $4.97M. Both have same MER 0.19%. I am interested in IND because it seems to an Indian equivalent of SP500 / diversity of underlying stocks. However, the newness troubles me and seems like the buy sell spread on IND is also quite high. It is also from a company I have never heard of. The MER on [INDA]( is much higher at 0.62%. And the Canadian [XID]( MER is insane at 0.99%. FLIN has about half the stock tickers present in IND. However, is IND actually better in the long run because it is potentially a more diverse investment?",

      "selftext": "Back in early June, I came across MU through a stock screener and started keeping an eye on the company. By mid-June, I noticed the stock was on a consistent upward trend, so I dove deeper into my research. Based on my findings, I made the decision to start building a position around $113. Fast forward to today, and my MU holdings now account for 40% of my portfolio. After Christmas, the stock rose another 10 points, reaching an impressive $287. This is the most money I’ve made in a stock, and honestly, it’s the best Christmas gift I could’ve asked for. Now, I’m at a crossroads. Do I keep adding to my position and maintain the high-risk, high-reward strategy, or do I start taking some profits off the table and reduce my exposure to lock in these gains? Do you think Micron’s future potential can keep this momentum going, or is the stock price approaching a temporary peak?",

      "selftext": "Every thread here and elsewhere asking about top picks for 2026 has at least one space stock recommendation like RKLB or ASTS, but are they really a great investment when they're priced for perfection and at higher multiples than the industry leader? Why space stocks will struggle in 2026: 1. Space business requires a ton of capital, that means constant dilution. Both companies have tripled and quadrupled their shares in just few years but will still need much more capital to reach breakeven or in the case of ASTS, just to start generating revenue. 2. Space will always have very high \"cost of revenue\" associated with it, will always have high R&D, and G&A, yet they're priced like software companies with low cost of revenue and low R&Ds and G&As. 3. Space is dangerous, one thing goes wrong and the stock takes a massive hit overnight. For instance, ASTS has to launch 100+ satellites (they launched 1 in all of 2025) and one setback and they're immediately months behind schedule. There's a risk discount that should always be assigned to space stocks. 4. Both companies are competing against the most dominant space company and the richest and deepest-pocketed billionaire in the world. SpaceX just spent $20 billion to acquire global spectrum that will make their path to offering D2D service so much easier and quicker than ASTS. SpaceX is also about 3-5 years ahead of RKLB on tech and reusable rockets. 5. Both companies are still playing catch-up to SpaceX. In the case of ASTS, they mostly depend on SpaceX to launch their satellites in the near future. 6. SpaceX IPO will literally wipe out most retail and institutional interest, why own a second-fiddle wannabe when you can own the real leader? Why buy RIVN or LCID when you can buy TSLA? I still think space companies will make great investments in 2026 but some of the current valuations are absurd. RKLB trading at 70 Price-to-Sales ratio. ASTS is still a per-revenue company yet it's valued at close to $30 billion!!!",

      "selftext_processed": "Every thread here and elsewhere asking about top picks for 2026 has at least one space stock recommendation like RKLB or ASTS but are they really a great investment when theyre priced for perfection and at higher multiples than the industry leader Why space stocks will struggle in 2026 1 . Space business requires a ton of capital that means constant dilution . Both companies have tripled and quadrupled their shares in just few years but will still need much more capital to reach breakeven or in the case of ASTS just to start generating revenue . 2 . Space will always have very high cost of revenue associated with it will always have high RD and GA yet theyre priced like software companies with low cost of revenue and low RDs and GAs . 3 . Space is dangerous one thing goes wrong and the stock takes a massive hit overnight . For instance ASTS has to launch 100 satellites they launched 1 in all of 2025 and one setback and theyre immediately months behind schedule . Theres a risk discount that should always be assigned to space stocks . 4 . Both companies are competing against the most dominant space company and the richest and deepestpocketed billionaire in the world . SpaceX just spent $ 20 billion to acquire global spectrum that will make their path to offering D2D service so much easier and quicker than ASTS . SpaceX is also about 35 years ahead of RKLB on tech and reusable rockets . 5 . Both companies are still playing catchup to SpaceX . In the case of ASTS they mostly depend on SpaceX to launch their satellites in the near future . 6 . SpaceX IPO will literally wipe out most retail and institutional interest why own a secondfiddle wannabe when you can own the real leader Why buy RIVN or LCID when you can buy TSLA I still think space companies will make great investments in 2026 but some of the current valuations are absurd . RKLB trading at 70 PricetoSales ratio . ASTS is still a perrevenue company yet its valued at close to $ 30 billion"

The reasoning for investing in Indian ETF is there is a possibility of me retiring in India in the distant future. I have read that you should have a tilt towards where you will be spending your investment return in the future. For example, VEQT / XEQT / ZEQT have a Canada bias. While FLIN is well established with $2.85B in AUM, IND is brand new (only started in Nov 2025) with AUM of only $4.97M. Both have same MER 0.19%. I am interested in IND because it seems to an Indian equivalent of SP500 / diversity of underlying stocks. However, the newness troubles me and seems like the buy sell spread on IND is also quite high. It is also from a company I have never heard of. The MER on [INDA]( is much higher at 0.62%. And the Canadian [XID]( MER is insane at 0.99%. FLIN has about half the stock tickers present in IND. However, is IND actually better in the long run because it is potentially a more diverse investment?",

And the Canadian XID MER is insane at 0.99 % . FLIN has about half the stock tickers present in IND . However is IND actually better in the long run because it is potentially a more diverse investment"

      "selftext": "Back in September, I found TVTX using a stock screener and started following it. In early October, I noticed the stock was moving up in a steady, consistent trend, so I took a deeper look at the company’s fundamentals. Based on that, I opened a position around **$25**. So far, TVTX has performed pretty much in line with my expectations, and the trend has been solid. Now that the stock is trading around **$42**, I’m feeling a bit unsure. Do you see this level as a key resistance, or just a short-term consolidation before another move higher? Curious to hear how others are thinking about the risks and opportunities at this price",

      "title": "Risks for Venture Global stock",
      "selftext": "Based on 3Q earnings, Venture Global reported that they have 67 mtpa of LNG capacity in operation or under construction and that number will reach 100 mtpa by 2030. Additionally, they have secured offtake agreements for 45 mtpa already. These agreements are mostly long-term supply and purchase agreements (SPAs) lasting a duration of 20 years. LNG demand is poised to grow over the next 2 decades, primarily in Asia, due to energy consumption growth in many developing economies, coal-to-gas switching and decarbonization, and also due to growth in AI data centre power consumption. My understanding is that they make money from liquefaction fees that are specified in these SPAs, priced at around US$5-7/mmbtu. Hence, this serves as a source of long-term stable revenues. Of course, the company is currently taking on large amounts of debt to finance the construction of the various natural gas liquefaction terminals. Additionally, it is currently embroiled in legal issues with Shell and BP, who are some of the off-takers of its LNG cargoes. They won the case against Shell but lost the case against BP. Venture Global has been accused by these companies of not abiding by the terms of these SPAs when they sold their commissioning cargoes for one of their projects on the spot market for large profits during the period of high LNG prices brought about by the Russia-Ukraine war. I am unsure of what is the long-term impact of these legal battles, but I think it should not affect the long-term business case. I am relatively optimistic about the future performance of $VG as it will soon grow to a size comparable to Cheniere and will also exceed it in LNG export capacity. The LNG market seems to be growing healthily. As long as they can find buyers for their capacity and execute on their projects, I would think that the stock price can easily hit 15-18 dollars within the next 1-2 years. I am curious if there are any risks that I may have missed out in my current analysis?",

      "selftext_processed": "Based on 3Q earnings Venture Global reported that they have 67 mtpa of LNG capacity in operation or under construction and that number will reach 100 mtpa by 2030 . Additionally they have secured offtake agreements for 45 mtpa already . These agreements are mostly longterm supply and purchase agreements SPAs lasting a duration of 20 years . LNG demand is poised to grow over the next 2 decades primarily in Asia due to energy consumption growth in many developing economies coaltogas switching and decarbonization and also due to growth in AI data centre power consumption . My understanding is that they make money from liquefaction fees that are specified in these SPAs priced at around US $ 57mmbtu . Hence this serves as a source of longterm stable revenues . Of course the company is currently taking on large amounts of debt to finance the construction of the various natural gas liquefaction terminals . Additionally it is currently embroiled in legal issues with Shell and BP who are some of the offtakers of its LNG cargoes . They won the case against Shell but lost the case against BP . Venture Global has been accused by these companies of not_abiding by the terms of these SPAs when they sold their commissioning cargoes for one of their projects on the spot market for large profits during the period of high LNG prices brought about by the RussiaUkraine war . I am unsure of what is the longterm impact of these legal battles but I think it should not_affect the longterm business case . I am relatively optimistic about the future performance of $ VG as it will soon grow to a size comparable to Cheniere and will also exceed it in LNG export capacity . The LNG market seems to be growing healthily . As long as they can find buyers for their capacity and execute on their projects I would think that the stock price can easily hit 1518 dollars within the next 12 years . I am curious if there are any risks that I may have missed out in my current analysis"

      "selftext": "As we all know, MU has been doing exceptionally well this last year and the outlook so far is only up. I've kept almost all of my RSU's and ESPP that I've gotten from MU for the last year or two and needless to say it's grown significantly in size and now I'm not sure what to do with them. Option 1 is just keep them all and ride the wave for as long as I can, but historically MU is very cyclical and when it goes down, it goes down hard. The AI revolution helps with this, but it isn't a cure. Option 2 is sell and diversify into other stuff. Outside of this I follow a typical boglehead strategy and it's worked well for me. I would only sell RSUs first and wait until ESPPs become long term for tax advantages (\\~6 months for 1 group, 1 year for another). My holdup is since MU has done so well over the last year, keeping until the new fab(s) come online could have some insane gains that I don't want to miss out on. On the other hand, selling and diversifying gets me all the compounded gains up until the same point, it's a question of which one is likely to make more. I suppose option 3 could be to sell half and keep half to get a piece of both cakes? Not sure, looking for some advice. Thanks.",

In 2005 we had the same prices as in 2012, went up to 1500 during the 2008 financial crisis, then down and slowly climbed up again.

      "title": "Top Quality DD on ETH: High Conviction trade since my last DD on META (hand written not AI)",
      "selftext": "Alright, regards, if you had been following my last DD on META, you would’ve done really well. Since that DD post, my position has been up moderately + I’ve been getting really good yield on the covered calls written against my longer dated call (I bought back when I’m up 50% and sell another call when the stock rallies with climbing implied volatility). I will still follow my original trade plan in my previous DD post for exits and take profits. TLDR: Fundamentally: Gold and Silver are mainly driven by money supply aka inflation. BTC and ETH are sharing this trend since they were gradually adopted by institutions and mainstream (around 2021 to present). I am arguing that BTC and ETH are acting more and more like commodities since then. Macro/Policy: The current administration is keeping inflation higher for longer. Bullish for commodities. Thesis: Commodity will move higher with inflation and BTC and ETH in particular will experience a catch up trade as the current cycle isn’t over yet. Short/Medium term catalyst for ETH is the tokenization of stock security and long term catalyst for ETH is stablecoin market cap will 10x by 2030 (according to scott bessent). DD starts here: I’m here today to make you all a bit more money for Christmas. ETH, some people call it digital silver, some people call it the backbone of Wall Street, some people call it a scam (I think quite a few of these people have lost money on it). Tom Lee has called it the macro trade of the decade, and more people are calling Tom Lee a con artist lately, while others are still amazed at his haircut. All the noise makes it hard to focus on the main issue - is Ethereum worth anything, or is it just fairy dust? In my DD, I want to focus on the first principles of things so you won’t be reading an AI slop or some useless rambling of hopium. **What is value?** The traditional value investing way of computing the intrinsic value of an asset is by looking at all the future cash flow this asset can yield. Which is why we can value a stock, because owning the stock is partially owning the future cash flow the company generates By this metric, gold/silver/BTC/ETH are all the same - they have no intrinsic value as they don’t earn you any money just by holding them. Which leads us to the next question: why are gold and silver doing so well, while BTC and ETH are trading like hot garbage? **What is price? How are commodities priced?** There are many factors that influence the price of a commodity. The most common factors include: utility, scarcity, trust/credibility, cost to carry, supply and demand, and most importantly market sentiment (mass psychology). For gold and silver specifically, they have limited in supply (on earth) and have been around for a long time where people have trust in them not only as commodities but also as currencies. In terms of utility, Silver has various industrial utility due to its superior conductivity and gold has a stable demand in many industries shown in the graph below. However, if you just look at supply vs demand, you would realized they are not off by much and it’s not really the driver for gold price (same for silver). **What is the real driver for price?** As mentioned earlier, gold and silver have been around long enough for people to trust them not just as commodities, but as currencies. So much so that they are considered risk-off assets (or save haven when shit hits the fan). Central banks build reserves with gold to maintain their monetary system credibility in and preserve national wealth against various economic risks. In other words, gold and silver are strongly linked to fiat currency and we can use money supply as a proxy for gold and silver. (as shown in chart below) Like the stock market, gold and silver prices goes up with the increasing money supply (aka inflation). On top of that, gold and silver has demonstrated to be the safe haven when a crisis happens. Both gold and silver had a massive rally in 2011 during the global financial crisis as everyone thought the U.S. financial system was going to collapse and piled their money into gold and silver for safety. **What about BTC and ETH?** There are certainly similarities for BTC and ETH when compared to gold and silver. For example, BTC also has a fixed total supply and is the world’s first ever decentralized payment network based on the blockchain (similar to gold, it became a much more volatile version of store of value). And ETH took blockchain a step further and became a global computing network that allowed programmers to build decentralized applications used to tokenize any assets (sounds like silver when it comes to utility). The photo below illustrates the market value of tokenized assets and transactions on the ETH network in 2024. While ETH only shares a tiny portion of the TAM in these transactions, ETH is definitely a leader in terms of the tokenization of assets. So far, 65% of stablecoin runs via ETH and according to Scott Bessant, the market cap of stablecoin will grow ten fold into 2030. So it definitely sounds like a ton of upside for this network. While it sounded like a greenflag on paper, I consider the ETH supply to be a red flag. ETH bulls like to say ETH has a burning mechanism on a portion of the transactional fees that creates a deflationary effect on ETH (as projection chart shows below, the total supply of ETH is projected to decline in the coming years + ETH gives a dividend), I find this to be shady and don’t really buy it. On top of that, I think the switching cost is too high given ETH network has a pretty expensive transactional fee aka gas price. But if the supply projection holds true, ETH will be much closer to the digital silver. Regardless of how many gold and silver traits BTC and ETH embodies, the correlation between BTC/ETH and M2 says it all. Both commodities are starting to show correlation with money supply and the stock market since 2021. And the reason why I picked this time frame is because both BTC and ETH started to gain adoption from the mainstream and institutions during the period. So why does it feels like BTC and ETH are trading with the stock market like a risk on asset? This explanation is based on an interview by Steve Eisman with Rahul Jindal, a FinTech strategist at Autonomous. Jindal explains that BTC and ETH began trading more like stocks after 2019 because the type of investor holding crypto changed. In the early years, crypto was mostly owned by early adopters who viewed it as a hedge against banks and fiat money, so it was less correlated with equities. After COVID, easier access through exchanges, large retail participation, and excess liquidity caused crypto to be held alongside stocks in investor portfolios. As a result, BTC and ETH became sensitive to money supply and risk appetite, which explains why they have moved closely with the stock market since 2021 rather than behaving like gold. This does not mean BTC and ETH will always trade like high-beta stocks. As adoption matures and ownership shifts further toward institutions and long-term holders, their prices are more likely to be driven by supply constraints, network usage, and monetary demand rather than short-term liquidity cycles. Over time, this would allow BTC and ETH to behave more like commodities, where value is tied to money supply, instead of purely reacting to stock market sentiment. **The Inflationary Policy & Macro effects** Trump has taken extensive measures (manipulating the BLS jobs data and putting pressure on the Fed) to keep the USD weak and interest rate low (to maintain export advantage + service the 38 trillion debt) despite high level of inflation. The promotion of stablecoin also introduces more inflation as people around the globe can now purchase USD backed by treasury (kinda like the U.S can issue debt to the entire world). The end of the quantitative tightening is another catalyst to at least support more liquidity coming into the equity and capital market. Which could be inflationary. **Short Term Catalyst for ETH: Tokenization** In 2025, the tokenization of stocks reach several milestones, including: * SEC roundtables on tokenization; platforms like Ondo launch tokenized stocks outside the US. * BlackRock explores tokenized ETFs; industry leaders predict massive market growth. * Nasdaq files to list tokenized stocks by 2026; Knowpia enables tokenization ahead of Wall Street. And 2026 could see further acceleration to this adoption. CNBC reports stock tokenization running on the ETH network: To visualize the true upsides of stock tokenization, the economists of Deutsche Bank offered some great insights on Tokenization below. So far, 90% of tokenized assets are stable coin (which ETH dominates) and the tokenization of stocks could really invite traffic to the ETH network **So why have BTC and ETH traded like hot garbage into year end?** Since late October, the stock market has been choppy rather than trending. Volatility stayed elevated and trend signals weakened, which caused systematic investors like CTAs and vol-targeting funds to reduce exposure. In this environment, BTC and ETH sold off during equity drawdowns but failed to rally on rebounds, not because of panic, but because risk appetite never fully returned. Positioning stayed light and investors remained cautious. So this looks more like a pause than a breakdown. The stock market has stabilized and pushed to new highs into year-end, which suggests sentiment is still intact. Most notably, the AI sector has remained strong. Earnings from Nvidia and Broadcom were outstanding, showing that growth expectations have not collapsed. As equity volatility compresses and risk-on sentiment improves, this gives the market room to grind higher. If that happens, liquidity and positioning should rotate back into high-beta assets, which is bullish for BTC and ETH heading into early 2026. Looking at the ETH chart, the day candle is showing stabilization and I don’t see why it wouldn’t revisit ATH and break above $5,250 in Q1 2026. **My expression for this bet: BMNR (I bought deep ITM BMNU calls so my breakeven is 0.4% at the time of purchase)** As I think ETH could re-visit 5k in Q1 2026, BMNR is the perfect pick. I pick it for 3 reasons: 1. No debt - so its much less of a fraud such as MSTR (which is also starting to price in not being included into S&P 500). 2. Premium to NAV expansion - if my thesis plays out, Tom Lee will look like a genius again premium to NAV can revisit higher levels: 1.3x - 1.5x (which is why I picked BMNR over SBET because people give leaders a premium in the treasury holding company world). 3. I think we are close to a reversal given crypto already being in a bear market with greed and fear recently being in extreme fear. (for reasons I mentioned earlier, the ETH network is doing great, far from a bear market - so the price being in a bear market zone is really just a gift). **Position**: I even bought for my TFSA:",

      "selftext_processed": "Alright regards if you had been following my last DD on META you would ’ ve done really well . Since that DD post my position has been up moderately I ’ ve been getting really good yield on the covered calls written against my longer dated call I bought back when I ’ m up 50 % and sell another call when the stock rallies with climbing implied volatility . I will still follow my original trade plan in my previous DD post for exits and take profits . TLDR Fundamentally Gold and Silver are mainly driven by money supply aka inflation . BTC and ETH are sharing this trend since they were gradually adopted by institutions and mainstream around 2021 to present . I am arguing that BTC and ETH are acting more and more like commodities since then . MacroPolicy The current administration is keeping inflation higher for longer . Bullish for commodities . Thesis Commodity will move higher with inflation and BTC and ETH in particular will experience a catch up trade as the current cycle isn ’ t over yet . ShortMedium term catalyst for ETH is the tokenization of stock security and long term catalyst for ETH is stablecoin market cap will 10x by 2030 according to scott bessent . DD starts here I ’ m here today to make you all a bit more money for Christmas . ETH some people call it digital silver some people call it the backbone of Wall Street some people call it a scam I think quite a few of these people have lost money on it . Tom Lee has called it the macro trade of the decade and more people are calling Tom Lee a con artist lately while others are still amazed at his haircut . All the noise makes it hard to focus on the main issue is Ethereum worth anything or is it just fairy dust In my DD I want to focus on the first principles of things so you won ’ t be reading an AI slop or some useless rambling of hopium . What is value The traditional value investing way of computing the intrinsic value of an asset is by looking at all the future cash flow this asset can yield . Which is why we can value a stock because owning the stock is partially owning the future cash flow the company generates By this metric goldsilverBTCETH are all the same they have no_intrinsic value as they don ’ t earn you any money just by holding them . Which leads us to the next question why are gold and silver doing so well while BTC and ETH are trading like hot garbage What is price How are commodities priced There are many factors that influence the price of a commodity . The most common factors include utility scarcity trustcredibility cost to carry supply and demand and most importantly market sentiment mass psychology . For gold and silver specifically they have limited in supply on earth and have been around for a long time where people have trust in them not_only as commodities but also as currencies . In terms of utility Silver has various industrial utility due to its superior conductivity and gold has a stable demand in many industries shown in the graph below . However if you just look at supply vs demand you would realized they are not_off by much and it ’ s not_really the driver for gold price same for silver . What is the real driver for price As mentioned earlier gold and silver have been around long enough for people to trust them not_just as commodities but as currencies . So much so that they are considered riskoff assets or save haven when shit hits the fan . Central banks build reserves with gold to maintain their monetary system credibility in and preserve national wealth against various economic risks . In other words gold and silver are strongly linked to fiat currency and we can use money supply as a proxy for gold and silver . as shown in chart below Like the stock market gold and silver prices goes up with the increasing money supply aka inflation . On top of that gold and silver has demonstrated to be the safe haven when a crisis happens . Both gold and silver had a massive rally in 2011 during the global financial crisis as everyone thought the U.S. financial system was going to collapse and piled their money into gold and silver for safety . What about BTC and ETH There are certainly similarities for BTC and ETH when compared to gold and silver . For example BTC also has a fixed total supply and is the world ’ s first ever decentralized payment network based on the blockchain similar to gold it became a much more volatile version of store of value . And ETH took blockchain a step further and became a global computing network that allowed programmers to build decentralized applications used to tokenize any assets sounds like silver when it comes to utility . The photo below illustrates the market value of tokenized assets and transactions on the ETH network in 2024 . While ETH only shares a tiny portion of the TAM in these transactions ETH is definitely a leader in terms of the tokenization of assets . So far 65 % of stablecoin runs via ETH and according to Scott Bessant the market cap of stablecoin will grow ten fold into 2030 . So it definitely sounds like a ton of upside for this network . While it sounded like a greenflag on paper I consider the ETH supply to be a red flag . ETH bulls like to say ETH has a burning mechanism on a portion of the transactional fees that creates a deflationary effect on ETH as projection chart shows below the total supply of ETH is projected to decline in the coming years ETH gives a dividend I find this to be shady and don ’ t really buy it . On top of that I think the switching cost is too high given ETH network has a pretty expensive transactional fee aka gas price . But if the supply projection holds true ETH will be much closer to the digital silver . Regardless of how many gold and silver traits BTC and ETH embodies the correlation between BTCETH and M2 says it all . Both commodities are starting to show correlation with money supply and the stock market since 2021 . And the reason why I picked this time frame is because both BTC and ETH started to gain adoption from the mainstream and institutions during the period . So why does it feels like BTC and ETH are trading with the stock market like a risk on asset This explanation is based on an interview by Steve Eisman with Rahul Jindal a FinTech strategist at Autonomous . Jindal explains that BTC and ETH began trading more like stocks after 2019 because the type of investor holding crypto changed . In the early years crypto was mostly owned by early adopters who viewed it as a hedge against banks and fiat money so it was less correlated with equities . After COVID easier access through exchanges large retail participation and excess liquidity caused crypto to be held alongside stocks in investor portfolios . As a result BTC and ETH became sensitive to money supply and risk appetite which explains why they have moved closely with the stock market since 2021 rather than behaving like gold . This does not_mean BTC and ETH will always trade like highbeta stocks . As adoption matures and ownership shifts further toward institutions and longterm holders their prices are more likely to be driven by supply constraints network usage and monetary demand rather than shortterm liquidity cycles . Over time this would allow BTC and ETH to behave more like commodities where value is tied to money supply instead of purely reacting to stock market sentiment . The Inflationary Policy Macro effects Trump has taken extensive measures manipulating the BLS jobs data and putting pressure on the Fed to keep the USD weak and interest rate low to maintain export advantage service the 38 trillion debt despite high level of inflation . The promotion of stablecoin also introduces more inflation as people around the globe can now purchase USD backed by treasury kinda like the U.S can issue debt to the entire world . The end of the quantitative tightening is another catalyst to at least support more liquidity coming into the equity and capital market . Which could be inflationary . Short Term Catalyst for ETH Tokenization In 2025 the tokenization of stocks reach several milestones including SEC roundtables on tokenization platforms like Ondo launch tokenized stocks outside the US . BlackRock explores tokenized ETFs industry leaders predict massive market growth . Nasdaq files to list tokenized stocks by 2026 Knowpia enables tokenization ahead of Wall Street . And 2026 could see further acceleration to this adoption . CNBC reports stock tokenization running on the ETH network To visualize the true upsides of stock tokenization the economists of Deutsche Bank offered some great insights on Tokenization below . So far 90 % of tokenized assets are stable coin which ETH dominates and the tokenization of stocks could really invite traffic to the ETH network So why have BTC and ETH traded like hot garbage into year end Since late October the stock market has been choppy rather than trending . Volatility stayed elevated and trend signals weakened which caused systematic investors like CTAs and voltargeting funds to reduce exposure . In this environment BTC and ETH sold off during equity drawdowns but failed to rally on rebounds not_because of panic but because risk appetite never_fully returned . Positioning stayed light and investors remained cautious . So this looks more like a pause than a breakdown . The stock market has stabilized and pushed to new highs into yearend which suggests sentiment is still intact . Most notably the AI sector has remained strong . Earnings from Nvidia and Broadcom were outstanding showing that growth expectations have not_collapsed . As equity volatility compresses and riskon sentiment improves this gives the market room to grind higher . If that happens liquidity and positioning should rotate back into highbeta assets which is bullish for BTC and ETH heading into early 2026 . Looking at the ETH chart the day candle is showing stabilization and I don ’ t see why it wouldn ’ t revisit ATH and break above $ 5250 in Q1 2026 . My expression for this bet BMNR I bought deep ITM BMNU calls so my breakeven is 0.4 % at the time of purchase As I think ETH could revisit 5k in Q1 2026 BMNR is the perfect pick . I pick it for 3 reasons 1 . No_debt so its much less of a fraud such as MSTR which is also starting to price in not_being included into SP 500 . 2 . Premium to NAV expansion if my thesis plays out Tom Lee will look like a genius again premium to NAV can revisit higher levels 1.3x 1.5x which is why I picked BMNR over SBET because people give leaders a premium in the treasury holding company world . 3 . I think we are close to a reversal given crypto already being in a bear market with greed and fear recently being in extreme fear . for reasons I mentioned earlier the ETH network is doing great far from a bear market so the price being in a bear market zone is really just a gift . Position I even bought for my TFSA"

But lately, I’ve been wondering whether the core constraint in this trade is still compute… or whether it has shifted to something far less exciting: **energy and grid infrastructure**. The scale of current AI investment plans is unprecedented. We’re no longer talking about incremental capex, but **$100B+ data center buildouts**, measured not just in dollars, but in *gigawatts*. At that level, chips are no longer the only bottleneck. Power availability, grid stability, and energy costs start to matter just as much. What’s interesting is that markets may already be reflecting this shift under the surface. AI hardware names have shown increasing volatility and sharp pullbacks after extended runs, while **utilities and power-related companies** have begun to quietly outperform. It’s not flashy, but it’s consistent with a market that’s starting to price the *next constraint* in the system. You can even see hints of this in trading behavior. On **Bitget** platforms , where both AI-heavy equities and energy-related names are actively traded in tokenized form, flows have become noticeably more two-sided. Instead of one-way momentum into AI, there’s growing interest in power generation, grid operators, and infrastructure-linked plays. This doesn’t mean the AI story is over. Far from it. AI adoption still looks structural, and companies like NVDA or TSM remain central beneficiaries over the long term. But markets don’t price stories in isolation they price constraints, risks, and second-order effects. And if energy and infrastructure become the limiting factors for AI expansion, capital allocation may gradually reflect that reality. So the question for long-term investors isn’t “AI or no AI,” but something more nuanced: * Do you stay heavily concentrated in AI infrastructure? * Do you start allocating toward utilities, power grids, and energy reliability? * Or do you balance both, accepting lower upside in exchange for resilience? Curious how others here are thinking about this shift, especially from a multi-year allocation perspective.",

      "selftext": "I work in fintech/banking in Central Asia and have been modeling a macro-structure for a unified economic zone (similar to the early EU or ASEAN) to solve the region's liquidity and logistic fragmentation. I want to stress-test this model from an **institutional investor's perspective**. If a jurisdiction adopted this framework, would it attract long-term capital, or are the structural risks still too high? **The Investment Thesis:** The region is currently undervalued due to political risk and fragmented borders. The proposed \"Federal\" model aims to derisk the environment for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) through four specific mechanisms. # 1. De-risking Governance (Political Stability) * **Problem:** Investors fear regime change and expropriation (the \"Strongman\" risk). * **Solution:** A rigid constitutional lock (40 years) on property rights. * **Mechanism:** Executive power is hedged by a Bicameral Legislature where the Upper House represents national interests (Open List PR), preventing any single clan from capturing the state. A mandatory Run-off system forces centrist coalitions, reducing the risk of radical policy swings (e.g., sudden nationalization). # 2. Monetary Predictability[[1]( * **The Fed Model:** An independent Central Bank with a **Dual Mandate** (Price Stability + Employment). * **Currency:** A unified currency backed by a basket of commodities (Gold/Uranium reserves) to prevent FX volatility for foreign investors. * **Banking:** Implementation of **Glass-Steagall** separation. Commercial banks focus on lending to the real sector (CAPEX), minimizing systemic risk from speculative bubbles. Adoption of ISO 20022 standards for seamless cross-border settlement. # 3. Solving the \"Labor Shortage\" Risk (Human Capital) Developed markets (Korea, Japan) are facing demographic collapse, shrinking their consumer base. This model aims to create a sustainable labor pool. * **Demand-Side Stimulus:** State-backed infrastructure projects (High-speed rail, Logistics) ensure full employment. * **Wage Floor via Sectoral Bargaining:** Instead of a race-to-the-bottom, higher wages are encouraged to build a **robust middle class** capable of consuming imported goods and services. * **Result:** A growing demographic dividend (average age \\~28) with increasing purchasing power, contrasting with aging East Asian markets. # 4. Infrastructure as an Asset Class * The State acts as the primary developer of the \"Dry Suez\" logistics corridors connecting China and Europe. * This lowers logistics costs for private businesses entering the market. **The Question for** r/investing**:** From a risk/reward perspective, does this institutional setup (Checks and Balances + Demand-Side Stimulus) make the region a viable target for institutional capital? Or does the heavy state involvement in infrastructure crowd out private investment too much?",

      "selftext_processed": "I work in fintechbanking in Central Asia and have been modeling a macrostructure for a unified economic zone similar to the early EU or ASEAN to solve the regions liquidity and logistic fragmentation . I want to stresstest this model from an institutional investors perspective . If a jurisdiction adopted this framework would it attract longterm capital or are the structural risks still too high The Investment Thesis The region is currently undervalued due to political risk and fragmented borders . The proposed Federal model aims to derisk the environment for Foreign Direct Investment FDI through four specific mechanisms . 1 . Derisking Governance Political Stability Problem Investors fear regime change and expropriation the Strongman risk . Solution A rigid constitutional lock 40 years on property rights . Mechanism Executive power is hedged by a Bicameral Legislature where the Upper House represents national interests Open List PR preventing any single clan from capturing the state . A mandatory Runoff system forces centrist coalitions reducing the risk of radical policy swings e.g . sudden nationalization . 2 . Monetary Predictability1 The Fed Model An independent Central Bank with a Dual Mandate Price Stability Employment . Currency A unified currency backed by a basket of commodities GoldUranium reserves to prevent FX volatility for foreign investors . Banking Implementation of GlassSteagall separation . Commercial banks focus on lending to the real sector CAPEX minimizing systemic risk from speculative bubbles . Adoption of ISO 20022 standards for seamless crossborder settlement . 3 . Solving the Labor Shortage Risk Human Capital Developed markets Korea Japan are facing demographic collapse shrinking their consumer base . This model aims to create a sustainable labor pool . DemandSide Stimulus Statebacked infrastructure projects Highspeed rail Logistics ensure full employment . Wage Floor via Sectoral Bargaining Instead of a racetothebottom higher wages are encouraged to build a robust middle class capable of consuming imported goods and services . Result A growing demographic dividend average age 28 with increasing purchasing power contrasting with aging East Asian markets . 4 . Infrastructure as an Asset Class The State acts as the primary developer of the Dry Suez logistics corridors connecting China and Europe . This lowers logistics costs for private businesses entering the market . The Question for rinvesting From a riskreward perspective does this institutional setup Checks and Balances DemandSide Stimulus make the region a viable target for institutional capital Or does the heavy state involvement in infrastructure crowd out private investment too much"

Today my coinbase account sits at $600 after selling the shitcoins at a loss and TD Ameritrade at $1400. Terrible investments, I know, but I've since learned about actual, more meaningful investments, so now I do a Roth IRA and HSA. I'd like to send the funds back to my bank account and reinvest into ETFs and maybe a small amount in PMs, though that's more like my investing side-chick right now. Will I pay taxes on funds that were ultimately a loss on my end? And if so, how do I go about filing and paying those taxes? I hate to see the money just sitting there so I want to put it to use again and actually get something out of it, and probably just liquidate the accounts after backing up any statements and info pertaining to them.",

Both investments lost money crypto was on meme coins and stocks were on TeslaApple . Today my coinbase account sits at $ 600 after selling the shitcoins at a loss and TD Ameritrade at $ 1400 . Terrible investments I know but Ive since learned about actual more meaningful investments so now I do a Roth IRA and HSA . Id like to send the funds back to my bank account and reinvest into ETFs and maybe a small amount in PMs though thats more like my investing sidechick right now . Will I pay taxes on funds that were ultimately a loss on my end And if so how do I go about filing and paying those taxes I hate to see the money just sitting there so I want to put it to use again and actually get something out of it and probably just liquidate the accounts after backing up any statements and info pertaining to them ."

In the past 3 months, I've lost about 12k, and it genuinely hurts to think about what else that could've gone to. My tuition, a new car, literally anything else other than a donation to the market lol. It's all about lessons learned though. I'm glad I learned them as a college student while it's still inconsequential. Thank you, WSB. Genuinely, it's been an incredibly fun ride, despite losing a shit ton of money. I'm sticking to shares from now on P.S, before those comments come in saying \"$12k is nothing. You haven't lost anything,\" this was $12k that I've been working hard for and learning how to properly invest and make good returns on since high school and saving up, so please be kind lol. It was an important chunk of money to me.",

I just kept consistently making trades that didnt go my way with money that I honestly couldnt afford to lose . In the past 3 months Ive lost about 12k and it genuinely hurts to think about what else that couldve gone to . My tuition a new car literally anything else other than a donation to the market lol . Its all about lessons learned though . Im glad I learned them as a college student while its still inconsequential . Thank you WSB . Genuinely its been an incredibly fun ride despite losing a shit ton of money . Im sticking to shares from now on P.S before those comments come in saying $ 12k is nothing_You havent lost anything this was $ 12k that Ive been working hard for and learning how to properly invest and make good returns on since high school and saving up so please be kind lol . It was an important chunk of money to me ."

      "selftext": "Okay, so I managed to run up 500 to 90k within a month and then proceeded to lose nearly all within a week, so far managing to lose \\~80k in the span of one week. Now I’m down to my last 13.5k (transferred everything over to robinhood due to slightly more favorable buying power rules as seen in the last image which says 11.5k but another 2k wire is en route from webull so it’s 13.5k). Long story short is that I had a hell of a run with spy 0dtes and started really blowing up naively thinking that this would continue indefinitely, but then ego got the best of me and I started spiraling downwards and got fucked over by theta on many occasions. Let this be a warning to everyone else not to delude yourself into thinking you’re a genius when you get lucky with gambling. Trying to get rich quick only works until it doesn’t. 25M with a six figure tech job and feeling I’m doing pretty well in my career with a lot more upside in the future, so it’s certainly not the end of the world, but damn does this hurt. Greed really got the best of me since I wanted to get rich in weeks rather than years and ultimately got my lesson from the school of hard knocks. Probably gonna need some time to mentally recover from this. TDLR: Don’t touch options. They will ruin your life.",

Long story short is that I had a hell of a run with spy 0dtes and started really blowing up naively thinking that this would continue indefinitely but then ego got the best of me and I started spiraling downwards and got fucked over by theta on many occasions . Let this be a warning to everyone else not_to delude yourself into thinking you ’ re a genius when you get lucky with gambling . Trying to get rich quick only works until it doesn ’ t . 25M with a six figure tech job and feeling I ’ m doing pretty well in my career with a lot more upside in the future so it ’ s certainly not_the end of the world but damn does this hurt . Greed really got the best of me since I wanted to get rich in weeks rather than years and ultimately got my lesson from the school of hard knocks .

      "title": "MSTR: Why 2026 Could Be a Massive Year",
      "selftext": "TL;DR: MicroStrategy (MSTR) is trading below the value of it's Bitcoin holdings. Short-term swings are sentiment-driven, but structurally the company is strong, positioned to benefit from the next Bitcoin bull cycle, and supported by growing institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s Slide & Market Factors - Macro risk-off: BTC dropped 30-40% from October highs due to higher rates, tech volatility, and a strong USD. ETF outflows & liquidations: Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $3.4B outflows in Nov 2025; leveraged crypto positions triggered $1B in forced liquidations. Crypto winter: BTC erased much of its YTD gains. When Bitcoin falls, “Bitcoin proxy” stocks like MSTR often fall even more. MSTR = Leveraged Bitcoin Exposure - Bitcoin-driven stock: MSTR amplifies BTC moves up or down. During the recent dip, MSTR dropped faster than BTC. Balance sheet buys: MicroStrategy continues acquiring Bitcoin via stock and debt, giving leverage on BTC rallies while retaining flexibility. Software business: Enterprise analytics platform still grows (Q3 2025 revenue \\~$128.7M, +10.9% YoY; subscription revenue \\~$46M, +65% YoY). Small compared to BTC, but it exists. Bitcoin Holdings & Per-Share Math - Total BTC: 671,268 BTC ($58.4B at $87,049/BTC) 87,000/BTC). Shares outstanding (diluted): \\~312,000,000 BTC per share: 671,268 ÷ 312,000,000 ≈ 0.00215 BTC/share Dollar value per share of BTC: 0.00215 × $87,000 ≈ $187/share MSTR trades at \\~$157.88. Each share represents roughly $187 of Bitcoin value, plus a small, growing software business and cash reserves. Market cap vs BTC holdings: \\~$46B vs \\~$58.4B, trading below implied BTC value. Impact of BTC moves: Every $10,000 rise in BTC adds \\~$21.5/share or \\~$6.7B total to MSTR’s BTC holdings. Why Bitcoin Could Go Up in 2026 - Post-halving cycle dynamics: Last Bitcoin halving was in April 2024. Historically, years 2–3 after a halving are strong bull phases (2012, 2016, 2020). Supply growth slows, while demand continues to increase. Institutional accumulation: Large institutions and corporate treasuries continue quietly buying Bitcoin on dips, adding structural demand. Banks entering crypto services: JPMorgan and other major banks are exploring crypto trading, lending, and custody services. Bitcoin can be used as loan collateral, unlocking liquidity without selling BTC. More institutional access reduces perceived risk, increases adoption, and supports price stability. Macro tailwinds: If the Fed starts cutting rates or inflation eases, risk assets like BTC historically outperform. Global adoption & limited supply: More users, corporations, and payment integration, combined with a capped supply (21M BTC), drives scarcity and potential upside. Why 2026 Could Be Favorable - BTC leverage: If Bitcoin rallies, MSTR (and MSTU) amplifies the move. Balance sheet & capital strategy: They can acquire Bitcoin while managing cash and debt. Software + subscriptions: Small recurring revenue provides a floor outside crypto. Structural advantage: Few public companies combine BTC exposure with access to capital markets. Institutional tailwinds: Banks and other institutions adopting crypto services reduce risk perception and expand demand. Bottom line: MSTR and MSTU are leveraged ways to play Bitcoin with corporate backing. Short-term swings are sentiment-driven, but structurally the company is strong. With historical post-halving trends, institutional accumulation, limited supply, and banks beginning to integrate Bitcoin, 2026 could be a favorable year for BTC — and your MSTU position could amplify those gains. Current positions: 2x leverage MSTR Bull (MSTU) - 2890 units @ $9.92. Continuing to DCA",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR MicroStrategy MSTR is trading below the value of its Bitcoin holdings . Shortterm swings are sentimentdriven but structurally the company is strong positioned to benefit from the next Bitcoin bull cycle and supported by growing institutional adoption . Bitcoin ’ s Slide Market Factors Macro riskoff BTC dropped 3040 % from October highs due to higher rates tech volatility and a strong USD . ETF outflows liquidations Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $ 3.4B outflows in Nov 2025 leveraged crypto positions triggered $ 1B in forced liquidations . Crypto winter BTC erased much of its YTD gains . When Bitcoin falls “ Bitcoin proxy ” stocks like MSTR often fall even more . MSTR Leveraged Bitcoin Exposure Bitcoindriven stock MSTR amplifies BTC moves up or down . During the recent dip MSTR dropped faster than BTC . Balance sheet buys MicroStrategy continues acquiring Bitcoin via stock and debt giving leverage on BTC rallies while retaining flexibility . Software business Enterprise analytics platform still grows Q3 2025 revenue $ 128.7M 10.9 % YoY subscription revenue $ 46M 65 % YoY . Small compared to BTC but it exists . Bitcoin Holdings PerShare Math Total BTC 671268 BTC $ 58.4B at $ 87049BTC 87000BTC . Shares outstanding diluted 312000000 BTC per share 671268 ÷ 312000000 ≈ 0.00215 BTCshare Dollar value per share of BTC 0.00215 × $ 87000 ≈ $ 187share MSTR trades at $ 157.88 . Each share represents roughly $ 187 of Bitcoin value plus a small growing software business and cash reserves . Market cap vs BTC holdings $ 46B vs $ 58.4B trading below implied BTC value . Impact of BTC moves Every $ 10000 rise in BTC adds $ 21.5share or $ 6.7B total to MSTR ’ s BTC holdings . Why Bitcoin Could Go Up in 2026 Posthalving cycle dynamics Last Bitcoin halving was in April 2024 . Historically years 2–3 after a halving are strong bull phases 2012 2016 2020 . Supply growth slows while demand continues to increase . Institutional accumulation Large institutions and corporate treasuries continue quietly buying Bitcoin on dips adding structural demand . Banks entering crypto services JPMorgan and other major banks are exploring crypto trading lending and custody services . Bitcoin can be used as loan collateral unlocking liquidity without selling BTC . More institutional access reduces perceived risk increases adoption and supports price stability . Macro tailwinds If the Fed starts cutting rates or inflation eases risk assets like BTC historically outperform . Global adoption limited supply More users corporations and payment integration combined with a capped supply 21M BTC drives scarcity and potential upside . Why 2026 Could Be Favorable BTC leverage If Bitcoin rallies MSTR and MSTU amplifies the move . Balance sheet capital strategy They can acquire Bitcoin while managing cash and debt . Software subscriptions Small recurring revenue provides a floor outside crypto . Structural advantage Few public companies combine BTC exposure with access to capital markets . Institutional tailwinds Banks and other institutions adopting crypto services reduce risk perception and expand demand . Bottom line MSTR and MSTU are leveraged ways to play Bitcoin with corporate backing . Shortterm swings are sentimentdriven but structurally the company is strong . With historical posthalving trends institutional accumulation limited supply and banks beginning to integrate Bitcoin 2026 could be a favorable year for BTC — and your MSTU position could amplify those gains . Current positions 2x leverage MSTR Bull MSTU 2890 units $ 9.92 . Continuing to DCA"
