      "title": "GRAIL ($GRAL) - Early cancer detection to grow in tens of multiples",
      "selftext": "$GRAL is a pure play on early cancer detection, with its Galleri blood test targeting a problem the healthcare system has never solved well: catching multiple cancers before symptoms appear. Galleri can screen for dozens of cancers in a single blood draw, many of which currently have no routine screening, and that alone puts it in a category with massive long term upside if adoption scales. The addressable market is enormous, and success here is less about quarterly numbers and more about clinical validation, regulatory progress, and payer acceptance. From a growth perspective, the key drivers are FDA approval pathways, Medicare reimbursement, and employer or health system adoption. Each of those acts as a step function for volume, not a linear ramp. Once reimbursement is secured, testing can move from discretionary to routine, which changes utilization overnight. Recent clinical data continues to support accuracy and real world usefulness, and partnerships with healthcare systems help de risk the rollout while building credibility with payers and regulators. Near term, GRAL remains volatile and news driven, which is typical for high conviction healthcare names pre scale. Management presenting at major healthcare conferences like JPM - on January 12th 2026 will likely keep the story in front of institutional capital and often precedes updates on trials, timelines, or commercialization strategy. This is not a value stock or a trade on multiples, it is a long duration growth bet on changing how cancer is detected. If Galleri becomes standard of care, today’s valuation will look small in hindsight. #biotech #fuckcancer #cancerdetection",

      "selftext_processed": "$ GRAL is a pure play on early cancer detection with its Galleri blood test targeting a problem the healthcare system has never_solved well catching multiple cancers before symptoms appear . Galleri can screen for dozens of cancers in a single blood draw many of which currently have no_routine screening and that alone puts it in a category with massive long term upside if adoption scales . The addressable market is enormous and success here is less about quarterly numbers and more about clinical validation regulatory progress and payer acceptance . From a growth perspective the key drivers are FDA approval pathways Medicare reimbursement and employer or health system adoption . Each of those acts as a step function for volume not_a linear ramp . Once reimbursement is secured testing can move from discretionary to routine which changes utilization overnight . Recent clinical data continues to support accuracy and real world usefulness and partnerships with healthcare systems help de risk the rollout while building credibility with payers and regulators . Near term GRAL remains volatile and news driven which is typical for high conviction healthcare names pre scale . Management presenting at major healthcare conferences like JPM on January 12th 2026 will likely keep the story in front of institutional capital and often precedes updates on trials timelines or commercialization strategy . This is not_a value stock or a trade on multiples it is a long duration growth bet on changing how cancer is detected . If Galleri becomes standard of care today ’ s valuation will look small in hindsight . biotech fuckcancer cancerdetection"

I’m currently up around 2000%(which I understand isn’t a whole lot $ wise) but I don’t really understand why it’s so popular. I’ve heard it’s the company “selling shovels for the gold rush” in the space industry, but why are people bullish on space exploration? The only thing I can think of is Elon saying occupy mars, but that’s wildly unrealistic in my opinion. I’ve been considering buying more, but I haven’t pulled the trigger because I don’t feel comfortable buying more without understanding the actual purpose of what they’re doing. Maybe I should do actual research, but I’ve done well with what I considered was basically a penny stock and now I’m seeing so much hype that I don’t really understand, so I’m between selling and buying more .",

Maybe I should do actual research but I ’ ve done well with what I considered was basically a penny stock and now I ’ m seeing so much hype that I don ’ t really understand so I ’ m between selling and buying more ."

      "selftext": "Does a \"perfect\" brokerage actually exist? I’m currently split between M1 and Robinhood and it’s a massive headache. I’ve reached the point where I’m spread too thin and tracking everything on a manual spreadsheet just to see my actual allocation, which sucks. **The M1 side:** I love the \"Pie\" setup for organizing my long-term stuff, but I’m over the trading windows and the way their auto-investing works. If one of my high-conviction stocks starts ripping, M1’s \"dynamic rebalancing\" basically stops buying it because it’s now \"overweight.\" I want my recurring buys to stay at the fixed % I set (e.g., if I set 10% to Apple, I want 10% of every deposit to go there regardless of the current price). **The Robinhood side:** The UI is obviously great and I love being able to set limit orders for flash crashes or just buy instantly. But managing a \"custom index\" of 15+ stocks on there is a nightmare. I don't want to set 15 separate recurring buy orders and manually rebalance them every month. Basically, I want: 1. M1-style Pies/Baskets (for organization). 2. Fixed-ratio DCA (every $100 deposit splits exactly how I set it). 3. Instant execution / No trading windows. 4. A UI that doesn't feel like it was built in 1995. I’ve looked at Public and Fidelity Solo Baskets but haven't pulled the trigger. Has anyone found a platform that actually hits all of these? Or a way to consolidate this without it being a second job?",

I’ve reached the point where I’m spread too thin and tracking everything on a manual spreadsheet just to see my actual allocation, which sucks. **The M1 side:** I love the \"Pie\" setup for organizing my long-term stuff, but I’m over the trading windows and the way their auto-investing works. If one of my high-conviction stocks starts ripping, M1’s \"dynamic rebalancing\" basically stops buying it because it’s now \"overweight.\" I want my recurring buys to stay at the fixed % I set (e.g., if I set 10% to Apple, I want 10% of every deposit to go there regardless of the current price). **The Robinhood side:** The UI is obviously great and I love being able to set limit orders for flash crashes or just buy instantly. But managing a \"custom index\" of 15+ stocks on there is a nightmare. I don't want to set 15 separate recurring buy orders and manually rebalance them every month. Basically, I want: 1.

I both like and dislike both for different reasons, there has to be a platform that offers the best of both worlds... right? **The problem statement:** I love the flexibility and ease of use of Robinhood when it comes to investing in individual ETFs/Stocks, but it doesn't allow for an \"Easy\" way to make my own \"pie\" that I can DCA into. I love the ease of use and visual interface on M1 for making my personal basket or \"index\" that I DCA into on a recurring deposit, but it only has two times of day that a trade will complete, doesn't allow for fixed auto-recurring deposits (goes based off current weight relative to target weight), and some other restrictions. I love robinhood for index investing because the UI/UX is top-tier and I can just easily set recurring investments. I also love robinhood for individual stocks that I invest in on a conditions basis (certain price met, flash crash, etc...). I love M1 for making \"pies\" (basically my own index) that auto-invest based on target weight and my recurring deposits that are set to auto from my bank. The issue is, between these platforms and stragegies, and other aspects of my financial situation, I've spread myself too thin. Even just to rebalance my strategy takes too much time to check two apps, do calculations, track it on a separate spreadsheet bc I can't do it all in one place, etc.. Happy to hear others' experiences and would love any reccomendations, even if it's not a direct answer to my question!",

      "selftext": "MU just popped \\~4% on decent volume, and this feels more structural than your typical intra-day swing. The broader semiconductor group has been lagging AI “pure plays,” but memory names had been oversold relative to both Nvidia and the rest of the chip complex. Today’s strength suggests some rotation may finally be happening. There are a few catalysts behind this move: signs of improving memory pricing in channel checks, continued AI server demand, and technicals showing a break above short-term consolidation. MU isn’t cheap, but the market seems to be repricing the earnings outlook after digesting last quarter’s results. I’m thinking of holding and looking for disciplined pullbacks to add, not chasing at the top. Still curious whether this is the start of a sustained move or just relief in a choppy sector. What do others see in MU’s tape right now?",

Regarding the future trend of ASTS, after the completion of waves 1-4 and 1-5, the range of the second wave of decline will be calculated based on the high point. Note that there are still two daily candlesticks left before reaching the Fibonacci resonance day (turning point). RKLB's trend can also be used as a reference; it also has two daily candlesticks left before reaching the resonance day. I tend to believe it will reach the top of wave 1.",

Regarding the future trend of ASTS after the completion of waves 14 and 15 the range of the second wave of decline will be calculated based on the high point . Note that there are still two daily candlesticks left before reaching the Fibonacci resonance day turning point . RKLBs trend can also be used as a reference it also has two daily candlesticks left before reaching the resonance day . I tend to believe it will reach the top of wave 1 ."

The Wegovy^(®) pill is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy approved for weight management. The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial^(2). In the OASIS 4 trial, oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6% mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities^(1). The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy^(®) pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy^(®) 2.4 mg. Furthermore, one in three people experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial^(1). The well-known safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy^(®) pill in the OASIS-4 trial, which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management. “The pill is here. With today's approval of the Wegovy^(®) pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy^(®) injection,” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy^(®) pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey. No other current oral GLP-1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy^(®) pill, and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US”. Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy^(®) pill in the US in early January 2026. Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg once-daily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025.

With todays approval of the Wegovy® pill patients will have a convenient oncedaily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy® injection ” said Mike Doustdar president and CEO of Novo Nordisk . “ As the first oral GLP1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity the Wegovy® pill provides patients with a new convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey . No_other current oral GLP1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy® pill and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US ” . Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy® pill in the US in early January 2026 . Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg oncedaily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency EMA and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025 . How will the stock react What do you think"

      "selftext": "The recent pullback in ADBE looks more like a normal reset in sentiment and valuation rather than any real deterioration in the underlying business. The core fundamentals remain intact, with a stable subscription model, solid cash flow, and strong product stickiness. This is not a name that suddenly became structurally broken. That said, from a trading perspective, this is also not a high conviction entry yet. The short term trend is still weak, and recent bounces appear more corrective than driven by aggressive dip buying. Volume and price action suggest that larger players are still patient and not in a rush to re establish positions. For me, the right move here is not bottom fishing and not chasing short term strength. This is a wait and observe situation. I want to see selling pressure fully clear and price stabilize, or momentum meaningfully shift back in favor of buyers. Until then, keeping risk off the table is more important than forcing a trade.",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Shares in Paramount Skydance (PSKY) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) spiked Monday after Larry Ellison, the centibillionaire founder and executive chairman of Oracle (ORCL), agreed to personally backstop $40.4 billion in equity financing for Paramount's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. >Paramount stock rose over 4%, while Warner Bros. shares rose by over 3.5%. >In a securities filing Monday morning, Paramount Skydance — led by Larry Ellison's son, David Ellison — said the elder Ellison had agreed to backstop the deal's financing to assuage fears from Warner Bros. Discovery's board. Last week, the board rejected Paramount's offer in favor of Netflix's (NFLX) bid, arguing in part that Paramount is too undercapitalized to be able to get an acquisition across the finish line. >Paramount's announcement on Monday stated that the Ellison family trust owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that Larry Ellison had agreed not to revoke the trust or \"adversely transfer\" assets while negotiations remain open. >\"Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD. Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4th, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders,\" David Ellison said in Paramount's press release. >\"Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice,\" he added. >Netflix stock fell over 1% Monday. >Warner Bros., led by media mogul David Zaslav, has become the target of a multi-round bidding war in recent weeks between Paramount and Netflix for the storied film studio and its collection of broadcast networks. >In Paramount's previous proposal, which was rejected by WBD's board, David Ellison's company would acquire both Warner Bros. streaming and studios division and its linear networks division in a $30 per share, all-cash acquisition valued at $108.4 billion. >The Ellison family and Gerry Cardinale's RedBird Capital would backstop \"100% of our equity commitments,\" or the $40.7 billion in equity required to push a deal through, while Jared Kushner's investment firm Affinity Partners and a cohort of Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would also provide capital while agreeing to \"forgo any governance rights.\" Affinity later withdrew from the hostile takeover bid. >Larry Ellison's offer to personally backstop $40.4 billion in financing comes after Warner Bros. \"assert\\[ed\\] that the only fix would be a personal guarantee from Mr. Ellison,\" Paramount said in its Monday morning announcement. >Warner Bros.' mid-December rejection of Paramount's offer appeared to tip the scales in favor of Netflix's proposal, which would see the streaming giant absorb WBD's streaming and studios division. Under Netflix's offer, the streaming giant, helmed by CEO Ted Sarandos, would bring Warner Bros.' film and TV studios, HBO, and HBO Max in-house. >Warner Bros.' other news, sports, and entertainment assets, in its \"global networks\" division, would be spun off into a separate public company called Discovery Global under a plan initially announced earlier in 2025. >However, that deal would be likely to face antitrust concerns, already flagged by President Trump. A combined Netflix-Warner Bros. would control approximately a third of US streaming activity, according to data from JustWatch, which is likely to draw the attention of the Justice Department.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Shares in Paramount Skydance PSKY and Warner Bros . Discovery WBD spiked Monday after Larry Ellison the centibillionaire founder and executive chairman of Oracle ORCL agreed to personally backstop $ 40.4 billion in equity financing for Paramounts proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Paramount stock rose over 4 % while Warner Bros. shares rose by over 3.5 % . In a securities filing Monday morning Paramount Skydance — led by Larry Ellisons son David Ellison — said the elder Ellison had agreed to backstop the deals financing to assuage fears from Warner Bros. Discoverys board . Last week the board rejected Paramounts offer in favor of Netflixs NFLX bid arguing in part that Paramount is too undercapitalized to be able to get an acquisition across the finish line . Paramounts announcement on Monday stated that the Ellison family trust owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that Larry Ellison had agreed not_to revoke the trust or adversely transfer assets while negotiations remain open . Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD . Our $ 30 per share fully financed allcash offer was on December 4th and continues to be the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders David Ellison said in Paramounts press release . Because of our commitment to investment and growth our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders as a catalyst for greater content production greater theatrical output and more consumer choice he added . Netflix stock fell over 1 % Monday . Warner Bros. led by media mogul David Zaslav has become the target of a multiround bidding war in recent weeks between Paramount and Netflix for the storied film studio and its collection of broadcast networks . In Paramounts previous proposal which was rejected by WBDs board David Ellisons company would acquire both Warner Bros. streaming and studios division and its linear networks division in a $ 30 per share allcash acquisition valued at $ 108.4 billion . The Ellison family and Gerry Cardinales RedBird Capital would backstop 100 % of our equity commitments or the $ 40.7 billion in equity required to push a deal through while Jared Kushners investment firm Affinity Partners and a cohort of Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would also provide capital while agreeing to forgo any governance rights . Affinity later withdrew from the hostile takeover bid . Larry Ellisons offer to personally backstop $ 40.4 billion in financing comes after Warner Bros. asserted that the only fix would be a personal guarantee from Mr. Ellison Paramount said in its Monday morning announcement . Warner Bros. midDecember rejection of Paramounts offer appeared to tip the scales in favor of Netflixs proposal which would see the streaming giant absorb WBDs streaming and studios division . Under Netflixs offer the streaming giant helmed by CEO Ted Sarandos would bring Warner Bros. film and TV studios HBO and HBO Max inhouse . Warner Bros. other news sports and entertainment assets in its global networks division would be spun off into a separate public company called Discovery Global under a plan initially announced earlier in 2025 . However that deal would be likely to face antitrust concerns already flagged by President Trump . A combined NetflixWarner Bros. would control approximately a third of US streaming activity according to data from JustWatch which is likely to draw the attention of the Justice Department ."

The five year chart shows a max price of around $49.24/share. I sold my entire position on 10/8/2024 for $92.03/share and the current chart shows a high price of $47.10/share for that day.

      "selftext": "A lot of people say TSM is undervalued right now because of geopolitical risk. There’s no question TSM is a great company. But the market keeps focusing on worst-case scenarios, and I think it’s worth discussing whether that uncertainty is already being priced in too much. From a fundamentals perspective, TSM still has clear strengths in advanced process nodes, capital efficiency, global foundry market share, and pricing power. Its long-term competitive position hasn’t really changed. If geopolitical risk is something that’s always there but low probability, does today’s valuation actually offer a margin of safety? Or is this the kind of risk that shouldn’t be ignored at all? Curious to hear what others think is TSM undervalued here, or is the market pricing it fairly?",

At this point, I don’t see a clear path for Disney to outperform, especially with streaming still pressuring margins and parks carrying earnings. I’m thinking of selling out of DIS entirely and rotating the capital to NFLX, making it a larger holding. Netflix has shown consistent execution, improving operating margins, positive and growing free cash flow, and real pricing power via the ad tier and password-sharing changes. Any potential M&A (e.g., WBD) is upside in my opinion. My base case is continued earnings and FCF growth, which I believe gives NFLX a reasonable chance to compound meaningfully over the next couple of years over DIS.

      "selftext": "I've explained it once, but badly - if I don't collect my thoughts well in advance it's hard to explain the reasoning behind certain plays. This post is the start of **my redemption ark (in terms of me being capable of explaining my thoughts)**, and so I will try to explain once more but more carefully why I decided to buy \"LUNR tickets\" when it was trading at $8\\~ I've since then got an 800% gain on my options: [My position \\(not including the new one I just made\\)]( # It started with a message from a WSB discord user I'll forever love this dude, he told me about LUNR and an LTV contract, briefly explained why LUNR is going to win the contract and that he has invested into them. My initial thoughts were the typical \"yea right, buddy\" thoughts: * How do I know you're a mechanical/space/whatever engineer that actually understands what is required by NASA? * How can you be so sure, that they are the ones to get picked? * Have you even checked their financials? [My brain when I realized what I realized]( But then my ADHD-crippled-monkey inside my brain took over: * Wait, did you say only three companies selected? * Final stage of the contest? * Previous collaborations with NASA? * Wait, you told me that there's a probability two companies might make the cut? * $4.7Bln contract? This is a typical 'gambling' game, and every gambling game can be analyzed, simulated and if you do it well enough you can get an edge. You see I used to play poker, and when you want to analyze a hand you do similar techniques that banks use to predict stock market prices. # Simple Gambling Math Note: To simplify the text and make it shorter, I'll denote probability as P(event). Imagine that you're playing a simple \"roll the 3-sided dice\" game. Each side has a probability of being rolled equal to 1/3. Now say you're betting $1 on your favorite number and if you win, you get $1.5 back. You could calculate the EV (expected value) of this game by simply calculating: P(win) \\* amount(won) + P(loss) \\* - amount(loss) = your EV (of discrete probability) so in our sample game we have: 1/3 \\* $1.5 - 2/3 \\* $1 \\~= $-0,17 Roughly translated to human language -> In the long run, for every time you decided to play this game you effectively lost $0.17 If we can figure out how this \"LTV contract game\" is played and what are the individual probabilities then we can figure out if it makes sense to play this game or not. # Monte Carlo Simulations Now here's what I was thinking, there's a lot of information out there, publicly available. That allows me to guess what might get factored into this decision. So all I need to do is to \"define a game\" and the rules to play this game, run simulations of this game and then approximate the likely probability. Why do I need to do this? To be as independent as possible (and factor in different odds of a decision being made this way). **So this is the game:** You have 3 companies at the beginning and in the end (1 or with a certain probability 2 will be picked), you have a set of rules where each rule defines which company scores points with what probability (random events). At the start of the game you chose a number equal to the number of rules you'll randomly select from the original set. At the start of each simulation you will modify the base probability of a rule (/event) occurring (and you do so randomly). Run a lot of simulations -> assess conditional probabilities based on results, i.e.: **- P(LUNR win | IF 1 selected)** **- P(LUNR win | IF 2 selected)** Now of course it gets even better if you start factoring the odds of the market recovering, space age boom, etc. everything slightly improving your odds. # Results Even if the chances that 1 company would've been selected, the odds were stacked in your favor as long as you were buying deep OTM calls with long expiry (at the time I bought end of JAN 12.5C for roughly \\~ 45c premium each). The reason for this is that the leverage increases your volatility, but as a result of that you can potentially lose everything you invested into it, standard shares would just fall to a certain price. However when factoring the possibility of 2 companies being selected the eventual probability of LUNR winning became slightly greater than 1/2... meaning that it just didn't make sense \"not to play\" - even if you think they might lose. As of right now, if it wasn't made clear that 2 companies would get selected... then buying the deep OTM calls wouldn't pay off (or barely for that matter), mostly because the premiums are already high. However - NASA made clear that they have an intention of awarding two companies, to diversify vendors and prevent vendor lock in, making the calls still lucrative. Huge insider buying a month or so back also indicated larger odds of winning, further helping the \"narrative\" that this is a valuable play. **Trying to estimate a PT** The problem with companies such as LUNR is that it's increasingly hard to estimate a PT. One of the possible ways of trying to guess the potential price is to take the contracts that they signed and just add them to the market cap -> recalculating the price (it's not perfect, it's pretty inaccurate, but it gives you some kind of an estimate). If I just assume that the current price already factors in some of the 4.7B contract then with a mkt cap of around 4.7B you get $40 a share. I tend to use this number as \"the super-positive estimate\", I then take roughly 1/3 of it and declare it as the \"the super-pessimistic estimate\" .. i.e. $40 / 3 \\~= $13.4 Pessimistic estimate set as $40/2 = $20 The middle ground is what I use as the \"average, regular estimate\" i.e. $30 \\----- So, rough estimates: **Super-positive estimate: $40+** **Average estimate: $30** **Pessimistic estimate: \\~$20** \\----- **Super-pessimistic estimate: $13.4** \\----- This kinda makes it clear why I decided to go with $12.5C. Current price - USD 16\\~",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive explained it once but badly if I dont collect my thoughts well in advance its hard to explain the reasoning behind certain plays . This post is the start of my redemption ark in terms of me being capable of explaining my thoughts and so I will try to explain once more but more carefully why I decided to buy LUNR tickets when it was trading at $ 8 Ive since then got an 800 % gain on my options My position not including the new one I just made It started with a message from a WSB discord user Ill forever love this dude he told me about LUNR and an LTV contract briefly explained why LUNR is going to win the contract and that he has invested into them . My initial thoughts were the typical yea right buddy thoughts How do I know youre a mechanicalspacewhatever engineer that actually understands what is required by NASA How can you be so sure that they are the ones to get picked Have you even checked their financials My brain when I realized what I realized But then my ADHDcrippledmonkey inside my brain took over Wait did you say only three companies selected Final stage of the contest Previous collaborations with NASA Wait you told me that theres a probability two companies might make the cut $ 4.7Bln contract This is a typical gambling game and every gambling game can be analyzed simulated and if you do it well enough you can get an edge . You see I used to play poker and when you want to analyze a hand you do similar techniques that banks use to predict stock market prices . Simple Gambling Math Note To simplify the text and make it shorter Ill denote probability as Pevent . Imagine that youre playing a simple roll the 3sided dice game . Each side has a probability of being rolled equal to 13 . Now say youre betting $ 1 on your favorite number and if you win you get $ 1.5 back . You could calculate the EV expected value of this game by simply calculating Pwin amountwon Ploss amountloss your EV of discrete probability so in our sample game we have 13 $ 1.5 23 $ 1 $ 017 Roughly translated to human language In the long run for every time you decided to play this game you effectively lost $ 0.17 If we can figure out how this LTV contract game is played and what are the individual probabilities then we can figure out if it makes sense to play this game or not_ Monte Carlo Simulations Now heres what I was thinking theres a lot of information out there publicly available . That allows me to guess what might get factored into this decision . So all I need to do is to define a game and the rules to play this game run simulations of this game and then approximate the likely probability . Why do I need to do this To be as independent as possible and factor in different odds of a decision being made this way . So this is the game You have 3 companies at the beginning and in the end 1 or with a certain probability 2 will be picked you have a set of rules where each rule defines which company scores points with what probability random events . At the start of the game you chose a number equal to the number of rules youll randomly select from the original set . At the start of each simulation you will modify the base probability of a rule event occurring and you do so randomly . Run a lot of simulations assess conditional probabilities based on results i.e . PLUNR win IF 1 selected PLUNR win IF 2 selected Now of course it gets even better if you start factoring the odds of the market recovering space age boom etc . everything slightly improving your odds . Results Even if the chances that 1 company wouldve been selected the odds were stacked in your favor as long as you were buying deep OTM calls with long expiry at the time I bought end of JAN 12.5C for roughly 45c premium each . The reason for this is that the leverage increases your volatility but as a result of that you can potentially lose everything you invested into it standard shares would just fall to a certain price . However when factoring the possibility of 2 companies being selected the eventual probability of LUNR winning became slightly greater than 12 ... meaning that it just didnt make sense not to play even if you think they might lose . As of right now if it wasnt made clear that 2 companies would get selected ... then buying the deep OTM calls wouldnt pay off or barely for that matter mostly because the premiums are already high . However NASA made clear that they have an intention of awarding two companies to diversify vendors and prevent vendor lock in making the calls still lucrative . Huge insider buying a month or so back also indicated larger odds of winning further helping the narrative that this is a valuable play . Trying to estimate a PT The problem with companies such as LUNR is that its increasingly hard to estimate a PT . One of the possible ways of trying to guess the potential price is to take the contracts that they signed and just add them to the market cap recalculating the price its not_perfect its pretty inaccurate but it gives you some kind of an estimate . If I just assume that the current price already factors in some of the 4.7B contract then with a mkt cap of around 4.7B you get $ 40 a share . I tend to use this number as the superpositive estimate I then take roughly 13 of it and declare it as the the superpessimistic estimate .. i.e . $ 40 3 $ 13.4 Pessimistic estimate set as $ 402 $ 20 The middle ground is what I use as the average regular estimate i.e . $ 30 So rough estimates Superpositive estimate $ 40 Average estimate $ 30 Pessimistic estimate $ 20 Superpessimistic estimate $ 13.4 This kinda makes it clear why I decided to go with $ 12.5C . Current price USD 16"

Production Growth & Asset Base** * Multiple producing mines provide diversification. * Expansion projects are expected to increase output and extend mine life. **3. Precious Metals Tailwinds** * Gold and silver tend to perform well during inflationary periods or economic uncertainty. * Silver also benefits from industrial demand (solar, electronics). **4.

I’m down quite a bit and at this point I’m not sure if holding makes sense anymore or if I’m just stuck in a sunk cost situation. 30k shares at 1,35. A big part of the story has been the lawsuits and alleged naked shorting, but so far there hasn’t been any real resolution. They’ve done multiple buybacks which on paper sounds positive, but the stock price keeps bleeding and the business itself doesn’t seem to get much attention compared to the legal stuff. I’m not trying to hype anything or push a narrative. I’m genuinely curious how others see this now: Are you still holding? Did you trim or exit? Do you think the legal angle is actually worth waiting for, or is the risk/time just too high? Just looking for opinions and discussion from people who’ve followed it or been in a similar situation.

      "selftext": "Micron (MU) Reports Record Q1 FY2026 Earnings and Issues Optimistic Guidance Last week, Micron Technology (MU) posted record earnings for Q1 of fiscal year 2026 and issued optimistic guidance for the upcoming quarter, which led to a strong rally in its stock. This has further solidified the company’s impressive performance this year, with its stock up over 200% year-to-date. As a leader in memory chips, Micron sells high-performance DRAM and NAND storage used in data centers and other computing devices. The company is benefiting from the AI-driven demand surge, which has helped transform what was once a sluggish earnings situation into a sharp increase in profits and cash flow. However, the current challenge is determining whether Micron's recent fundamental improvements truly justify the sharp rise in its stock price. But as the stock rallies, we have to ask: Will Micron’s impressive AI-driven growth hold up in the long term, or is this just a short-term surge fueled by hype?",

This has further solidified the company ’ s impressive performance this year with its stock up over 200 % yeartodate . As a leader in memory chips Micron sells highperformance DRAM and NAND storage used in data centers and other computing devices . The company is benefiting from the AIdriven demand surge which has helped transform what was once a sluggish earnings situation into a sharp increase in profits and cash flow . However the current challenge is determining whether Microns recent fundamental improvements truly justify the sharp rise in its stock price . But as the stock rallies we have to ask Will Micron ’ s impressive AIdriven growth hold up in the long term or is this just a shortterm surge fueled by hype"

TSM alone grew 41%, pushing its market share to 39%, and with NVDA, AMD, and AVGO orders, their 3nm and 4/5nm lines are basically maxed out. Meanwhile, other foundries only grew about 6%. Doesn’t really feel like AI demand is slowing more like TSM is the only one that can actually crank out these AI chips at scale. I don’t really buy the whole “AI hype is fading” story. Feels more like TSM is hitting capacity limits, not that orders are drying up. Short-term growth might slow a bit, but long-term? Hard to imagine AI scaling without TSM. Is the market seriously underestimating TSM’s dominance in AI chip manufacturing? Or am I just biased because I’m holding TSM?",

Feels more like TSM is hitting capacity limits not_that orders are drying up . Shortterm growth might slow a bit but longterm Hard to imagine AI scaling without TSM . Is the market seriously underestimating TSM ’ s dominance in AI chip manufacturing Or am I just biased because I ’ m holding TSM"

Countries like China, Russia and India trust the dollar even less now so. 6. Retail demand, it’s become a momentum trade at this point and retail traders are starting to get in. Lastly, the way to look at gold is not how gold is performing against the dollar but how the dollar is performing against gold. Gold will go down if dollar is expected to become stronger. We saw this in early 2010s where after austerity and US economic recovery Gold started to go down and then flattened. That does seem likely in near future.",

      "selftext": "Micron (MU) Reports Record Q1 FY2026 Earnings and Issues Optimistic Guidance Last week, Micron Technology (MU) posted record earnings for Q1 of fiscal year 2026 and issued optimistic guidance for the upcoming quarter, which led to a strong rally in its stock. This has further solidified the company’s impressive performance this year, with its stock up over 200% year-to-date. As a leader in memory chips, Micron sells high-performance DRAM and NAND storage used in data centers and other computing devices. The company is benefiting from the AI-driven demand surge, which has helped transform what was once a sluggish earnings situation into a sharp increase in profits and cash flow. However, the current challenge is determining whether Micron's recent fundamental improvements truly justify the sharp rise in its stock price. But as the stock rallies, we have to ask: Will Micron’s impressive AI-driven growth hold up in the long term, or is this just a short-term surge fueled by hype?",

This has further solidified the company ’ s impressive performance this year with its stock up over 200 % yeartodate . As a leader in memory chips Micron sells highperformance DRAM and NAND storage used in data centers and other computing devices . The company is benefiting from the AIdriven demand surge which has helped transform what was once a sluggish earnings situation into a sharp increase in profits and cash flow . However the current challenge is determining whether Microns recent fundamental improvements truly justify the sharp rise in its stock price . But as the stock rallies we have to ask Will Micron ’ s impressive AIdriven growth hold up in the long term or is this just a shortterm surge fueled by hype"

Currently space x holds around 90% of the US market and 60-70% of the global market, and their *total revenue is $5 billion dollars* (excluding starlink of course). Thats it. So even if you assume that the market for space launches let’s say triples AND that rocket labs can take a full third which is extremely optimistic as space x and blue origin have better technology, the potential yearly revenue shouldn’t be more than $5 billion. So even if they can eventually take a 10-20% net margin and earn $500 million, how can that justify the $40 billion in current valuation? How much stuff needs to be sent into space?",

Here is what the \"Smart Money\" is positioning for at the open: The $195 Conflict: There is a massive Gamma wall sitting at $195. If we open strong and flip $195 into support, the market makers will be forced to buy more to hedge, potentially sending us toward $210 very quickly. Dark Pool Support: The heavy institutional buying on Friday was concentrated at $182 - $185. This is our \"floor.\" As long as we hold above this, the trend is our friend. Opening Volatility: Expect a liquidity grab in the first 30 minutes. I’m looking for a specific retest of Friday’s value area high. My Strategy: I’ve mapped out two specific \"trigger zones\" for today’s session. One is a bull trap, and the other is a high-probability entry. I can’t post the full data visualizations and proprietary charts here due to sub rules, but I'm happy to share my notes and the specific Gamma flip levels with anyone looking to compare strategies. What’s your move at the bell? Chasing the gap or waiting for the dip?",

      "selftext": "Maybe I'm just getting old and cynical but does anyone else feel like most investing advice online is completely worthless now, like you'll see these long DD posts about why some stock is going to moon and the person literally has zero skin in the game, or they bought like 3 shares just to make the post seem legit and call it a day. I've been burned twice now following what seemed like solid analysis only to find out later the person was basically just guessing or had already sold their position before even posting, and the anonymity that makes reddit great for some things makes it terrible for investing advice if you ask me, I can't even trust the gain porn posts anymore because half of them are photoshopped or paper trading accounts which is just sad honestly. I'm not trying to gatekeep or anything but there's gotta be a better way to filter signal from noise you know, and at this point I'm more likely to trust my coworker who knows literally nothing about stocks than some rando on the internet claiming they made 400% on options, at least my coworker would tell me if they actually own what they're talking about instead of just making stuff up for karma. Anyway rant’s over, I'm just frustrated with how hard it is to find genuine investment discussion anymore without feeling like everyone's trying to scam you or pump their bags.",

Ive been burned twice now following what seemed like solid analysis only to find out later the person was basically just guessing or had already sold their position before even posting and the anonymity that makes reddit great for some things makes it terrible for investing advice if you ask me I cant even trust the gain porn posts anymore because half of them are photoshopped or paper trading accounts which is just sad honestly . Im not_trying to gatekeep or anything but theres got ta be a better way to filter signal from noise you know and at this point Im more likely to trust my coworker who knows literally nothing_about stocks than some rando on the internet claiming they made 400 % on options at least my coworker would tell me if they actually own what theyre talking about instead of just making stuff up for karma . Anyway rant ’ s over Im just frustrated with how hard it is to find genuine investment discussion anymore without feeling like everyones trying to scam you or pump their bags ."

      "selftext": "Lately I have been getting a lot of posts into my timeline from the likes of Ed Zitron and others who claim that Ai and all the companies involved is a massive bubble. The accusations range from straight up accounting fraud (millions of unused GPus in Warehouses) to raising questions about IMO legitimate concerns like how OpenAI will honor a trillion dollars in spending commitments on a couple billions of revenue. We all know how Sam Altman responded to the question and its anything but reassuring. Now he was asked this question again and his answer basically came down to: \"People have a hard time understanding exponential growth\" Now, if the Ai industry consisted of 2-3 companies one could shrug this off and see what would eventually happen. The odd thing to me is that ALL of the most successful companies in TECH that are in amazing shape and print billions of dollars every year basically bet their shirt on Ai. Oracle is literally risking a 700 billion dollar business on this one trade, even worse on one company, which is OpenAi and who they do this massive buildout for. Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all invest tens to hundreds of billions into Ai in the coming years. They are turning themselves from free cashflow giants to some of the biggest debtors in the world. This can't all be based on hope. They must know something that we don't but what could that be? Some things seem just true no matter how you spin them: \\- There is no real path to turn compute expense into revenue (Depreciation not even considered) \\- Most Ai features that are tried in a larger corporate context are rejected (Nobody wants to use Copilot) \\- The models are hardly differentiated and it seems incredibly difficult to even make money with them at all \\- the power needed to keep scaling the buildout is not available \\- Some of the most prominent figures in Ai say that the current approach to improve Ai will never work \\- The Ai startup eco system basically is a insert 5 dollars and get 2 dollars out scheme financed by VCs (what are they thinking??) So what could it all be about? Is Ai the great distractor from something else? If so, why would the tech giants participate and risk their companies? Is Ai really much better than we know already and there is a clear path to creating some sort of AGI using the compute buildout? If so, rather than competing the companies must be colluding to keep this \"hidden\". IMO unlikely. Is it something much more banal where early AI seemed promising but now these companies are stuck in a narrative they can't get out of? Imagine what ANY scaling back from AI, from on of those companies would do to the market. TLTR: Why does the AI ecosystem show so many obvious red flags while attracting levels of investment that suggest those red flags don’t exist?",

      "selftext_processed": "Lately I have been getting a lot of posts into my timeline from the likes of Ed Zitron and others who claim that Ai and all the companies involved is a massive bubble . The accusations range from straight up accounting fraud millions of unused GPus in Warehouses to raising questions about IMO legitimate concerns like how OpenAI will honor a trillion dollars in spending commitments on a couple billions of revenue . We all know how Sam Altman responded to the question and its anything but reassuring . Now he was asked this question again and his answer basically came down to People have a hard time understanding exponential growth Now if the Ai industry consisted of 23 companies one could shrug this off and see what would eventually happen . The odd thing to me is that ALL of the most successful companies in TECH that are in amazing shape and print billions of dollars every year basically bet their shirt on Ai . Oracle is literally risking a 700 billion dollar business on this one trade even worse on one company which is OpenAi and who they do this massive buildout for . Amazon Alphabet Meta and Microsoft all invest tens to hundreds of billions into Ai in the coming years . They are turning themselves from free cashflow giants to some of the biggest debtors in the world . This cant all be based on hope . They must know something that we dont but what could that be Some things seem just true no_matter how you spin them There is no_real path to turn compute expense into revenue Depreciation not_even considered Most Ai features that are tried in a larger corporate context are rejected Nobody wants to use Copilot The models are hardly differentiated and it seems incredibly difficult to even make money with them at all the power needed to keep scaling the buildout is not_available Some of the most prominent figures in Ai say that the current approach to improve Ai will never_work The Ai startup eco system basically is a insert 5 dollars and get 2 dollars out scheme financed by VCs what are they thinking So what could it all be about Is Ai the great distractor from something else If so why would the tech giants participate and risk their companies Is Ai really much better than we know already and there is a clear path to creating some sort of AGI using the compute buildout If so rather than competing the companies must be colluding to keep this hidden . IMO unlikely . Is it something much more banal where early AI seemed promising but now these companies are stuck in a narrative they cant get out of Imagine what ANY scaling back from AI from on of those companies would do to the market . TLTR Why does the AI ecosystem show so many obvious red flags while attracting levels of investment that suggest those red flags don ’ t exist"

      "title": "KSPI: WeChat / MELI style. Super-app in Kazakhstan, expanding in Turkey",
      "selftext": "Kaspi (KSPI) is Kazakhstan’s “super app”. It's similar to WeChat or to Amazon, Klarna bundled with other services (like messaging and Uber Eat) combined. The app is made of three components: * **Payments**: payment processing + analytics for consumers/merchants. Ex: 1.1M of transactions for restaurant (73x from 4Q'24 to 3Q'25). * **Marketplace**: connects buyers/sellers with omni-channel commerce. Like Amzn, they are also growing their advertising revenues rapidly on the marketplace (+56% from 3Q'24 to 3Q'25). The marketplace itself saw 83.7M purchases (+36% from 3Q'24 to 3Q'25) * **Fintech**: BNPL, finance, savings inside the Kaspi app. Other than innovations like pay with palm, financing (micro credit) is their fastest growing product (+17%) with 40% being Buy Now Pay Later. Both Savings and Revenues are increasing (double digits). Kaspi also has an e-Grocery line (1.3M consumers. +53% YoY) and recently integrated Glovo. They use AI to enrich content, which translates into improved profitability. Kaspi Ai creates more attractive descriptions and they track the impact with CTR and sales. In short, Kaspi innovates and executes brilliantly. They have a clear dominant position, and given the network effects, I would qualify it as a moat. In terms of profitability vs price. Metrics appear exceptional for a consumer-facing platform: * Operating margin: 51.3% * ROE: 66.9% * FCF yield: 9.5% * P/E: 6.9 (market cap \\~15B) \\+ Kaspi just approved a $100M buyback in November 2025. In terms of governance, the company is still cofounder-led with: * Mikheil Lomtadze (CEO) 22.51% * Vyacheslav Kim (Chairman) 21.2% * Management has 3.9% Most importantly, the culture was built from the ground up with an obsession on the NPS (customer focus) - a bit like Amazon. What brought the stock price down? Mostly two reasons: 1. There was a short report made by Culper Research a bit more than a year ago. In brief, it ties Kaspi to Russia, suggests dealmaking and possible sanctions from the US. Kaspi has replied to the claims. Stock went from \\~$120 before the report to \\~$77 today. 2. Macro + Sector: The local interest rates are very high (base rate is \\~16%), smartphones sales are decreasing, and like with all banks, there are concerns with their loans health. **Uncertainty:** Kapsi expanded into Turkey with the acquisition of a local e-commerce player (Hepsiburada 2025). Kaspi appears to replicate what it did in Kazakhstan and is in the process of getting a local bank license. Their Q3 report indicates successes with UX redesign (higher CTR) and continued growth, but M&A + new market means risk. Finally, KZ regulatory/tax risks are real, and geopolitical uncertainty exists. I believe the president (Kassym-Jomart Tokayev) is a tailwind for increased transparency, liberalism, and a balanced relationship with Russia. In addition, despite some Russian rhetoric that questions the Kazakh's claim to nationhood, I doubt Russia can afford another military front - especially under a new narrative. On the other hand, FDI are positive again. I am bullish on Kaspi's development in Turkey and continued success in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. I opened a long position on 19/12/2025.",

      "selftext_processed": "Kaspi KSPI is Kazakhstan ’ s “ super app ” . Its similar to WeChat or to Amazon Klarna bundled with other services like messaging and Uber Eat combined . The app is made of three components Payments payment processing analytics for consumersmerchants . Ex 1.1M of transactions for restaurant 73x from 4Q24 to 3Q25 . Marketplace connects buyerssellers with omnichannel commerce . Like Amzn they are also growing their advertising revenues rapidly on the marketplace 56 % from 3Q24 to 3Q25 . The marketplace itself saw 83.7M purchases 36 % from 3Q24 to 3Q25 Fintech BNPL finance savings inside the Kaspi app . Other than innovations like pay with palm financing micro credit is their fastest growing product 17 % with 40 % being Buy Now Pay Later . Both Savings and Revenues are increasing double digits . Kaspi also has an eGrocery line 1.3M consumers . 53 % YoY and recently integrated Glovo . They use AI to enrich content which translates into improved profitability . Kaspi Ai creates more attractive descriptions and they track the impact with CTR and sales . In short Kaspi innovates and executes brilliantly . They have a clear dominant position and given the network effects I would qualify it as a moat . In terms of profitability vs price . Metrics appear exceptional for a consumerfacing platform Operating margin 51.3 % ROE 66.9 % FCF yield 9.5 % PE 6.9 market cap 15B Kaspi just approved a $ 100M buyback in November 2025 . In terms of governance the company is still cofounderled with Mikheil Lomtadze CEO 22.51 % Vyacheslav Kim Chairman 21.2 % Management has 3.9 % Most importantly the culture was built from the ground up with an obsession on the NPS customer focus a bit like Amazon . What brought the stock price down Mostly two reasons 1 . There was a short report made by Culper Research a bit more than a year ago . In brief it ties Kaspi to Russia suggests dealmaking and possible sanctions from the US . Kaspi has replied to the claims . Stock went from $ 120 before the report to $ 77 today . 2 . Macro Sector The local interest rates are very high base rate is 16 % smartphones sales are decreasing and like with all banks there are concerns with their loans health . Uncertainty Kapsi expanded into Turkey with the acquisition of a local ecommerce player Hepsiburada 2025 . Kaspi appears to replicate what it did in Kazakhstan and is in the process of getting a local bank license . Their Q3 report indicates successes with UX redesign higher CTR and continued growth but MA new market means risk . Finally KZ regulatorytax risks are real and geopolitical uncertainty exists . I believe the president KassymJomart Tokayev is a tailwind for increased transparency liberalism and a balanced relationship with Russia . In addition despite some Russian rhetoric that questions the Kazakhs claim to nationhood I doubt Russia can afford another military front especially under a new narrative . On the other hand FDI are positive again . I am bullish on Kaspis development in Turkey and continued success in Kazakhstan and Central Asia . Disclaimer This is not_investment advice . I opened a long position on 19122025 ."

      "selftext": "I’m currently evaluating the possibility of taking a position in Roblox Corporation (RBLX) and thought I could walk through my thought process. Over the last couple of dayss, I’ve taken the time to analyze the company data and attempt to determine if its current share price accurately reflects its underlying long-term value. Fundamentally, the stock has been under a lot of pressure, and this presents a great point of entry in my opinion. The engagement and retention figures are great, and the user base is growing steadily. The company is currently operating at a loss; however, it seems likely that it will be able to harness the power of operating leverage to significantly improve margins as the monetization of the business increases. In my opinion, this is one of the main catalysts for the stock to unlock substantial upside in the next 3–5 years. I also analyzed market sentiment and risk factors. The shares have been affected by some macro trends, such as high interest rates and underperformance in growth stocks, as well as doubts in the market concerning timelines for growth and profitability. A number of these risks are valid, such as volatility, regulatory risks, and competition, although I think they are underestimating the associated upside with revenue acceleration and margin expansion. From a valuation and technical perspective, this stock is currently being priced below where its prospects for scalability and profit-driven growth exist. Based on a model outlook that factors revenue growth, monetization gains, and scalability, I personally feel this stock has the potential for outstanding gains if such trends continue. The market conditions are also conducive for steady accumulation, which suits my investment strategy. In summary, my personal investment view is based on fundamentals, growth potential, operating leverage, market sentiment, and risk-adjusted valuations. Although there do exist potential risks on the negative side, I do believe in the potential for extended-term growth which currently is not factored in by the stock price. My strategy would be to gradually build positions, hold positions for 3–5 years, and keep a strict watch on important growth & profitability metrics. This is my POV, I just wanna know what I am evaluating is based on facts or I have some prejudice for RBLX, or am I missing something ???",

Waymo halted service in San Francisco as of Saturday at 8 p.m. after its vehicles snarled traffic during a nasty blackout that left traffic lights across the city down. Blackouts hit some 125,000 homes and businesses throughout the day, according to Mission Local. We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the widespread power outage. Our teams are working diligently and in close coordination with city officials to monitor infrastructure stability, and we are hopeful to bring our services back online soon,” a Waymo spokesperson told The Independent Sunday morning. Without working traffic lights, the driverless cars were seemingly left confused, with many halting in their tracks and causing major traffic jamS.",

Waymo halted service in San Francisco as of Saturday at 8 p.m. after its vehicles snarled traffic during a nasty blackout that left traffic lights across the city down . Blackouts hit some 125000 homes and businesses throughout the day according to Mission Local . We have temporarily suspended our ridehailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the widespread power outage . Our teams are working diligently and in close coordination with city officials to monitor infrastructure stability and we are hopeful to bring our services back online soon ” a Waymo spokesperson told The Independent Sunday morning . Without working traffic lights the driverless cars were seemingly left confused with many halting in their tracks and causing major traffic jamS ."

More than double the S&P 500's return of 16.20% this year! In 2024, Reddit's Dark Horse thread picks also more than doubled the S&P 500! The Dark Horse Stocks mentioned in the thread returned 50.92% , and the S&P 500's returned 23.92% that year. I would like to pose the question again for 2026 and see if Wallstreetbets can beat the S&P 500 for the third year in a row. I will compile a list based on the most upvoted comments based on this thread and post results New Years Eve. What are your top Dark Horse Picks for 2026? Which stocks, that nobody thinks will do good, will do the best in 2026? Stocks that will rise from the dead and take us on a ride. Stocks that people count out. Stocks that are beaten down. Which stocks will make the biggest comebacks in 2026?",

Mom on the other hand who had her own portfolio would buy stocks and hold them for 20, 30, or 40 years. She always taught me that slow and steady was the best way to invest but she could never convince my father to do the same. Dad was a great man and my only hero.

      "selftext_processed": "And I was raised by one . Years back I remember when ATT or GE or Microsoft would drop $ 0.50 or a dollar . My dad would immediately call his broker and sell everything thinking the world was coming to an end . In a few days later the stock would be back up and he would hate himself for selling everything . Mom on the other hand who had her own portfolio would buy stocks and hold them for 20 30 or 40 years . She always taught me that slow and steady was the best way to invest but she could never_convince my father to do the same . Dad was a great man and my only hero . I just wish the market wouldnt have drove him so nuts . What makes people freak out and trigger them to sell during the slightest sign of a drop when history tells you that most stocks will always come back up and grow"

      "selftext": "Software has taken a relative beating this year: while the software ETF, IGV, is up 8%, many stalwart software names like Adobe, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Asana, Workday, and Atlassian are down or treading water at best. **My take is there's opportunity here, as a bunch of these names will return to the premium valuations they used to command. NOW, CRM, INTU, VEEV, CDNS, and SNPS are some ones that look interesting.** The narrative that has punished these stocks is that AI will \"eat\" software. But not all of the threats that have been articulated withstand scrutiny: 1. AI \"Eats\" Software: Overhyped. The idea is companies will use AI to build their software in-house and stop buying from software companies. However, defining and testing software still takes work. There's a reason companies outsource or buy what isn't their core competency, and this should continue in the future. 2. More competition: Slightly overhyped. The idea is it's cheaper to create software, so there will be more competition. This is likely true, and especially true in niche markets that were too small to build for in the past. However, the history of the software industry is that the cost to create it has steadily decreased, allowing better and better software to be created. Given this, with increasing supply of software it seems like competitive advantages like distribution channels, brand, and lock-in will continue to be important. So many current leaders probably continue to win here. 3. Seat model risk: Real but not catastrophic. The idea here is that SaaS companies have overoptimized on charging per seat, but with potential reductions in headcount and generative AI computing economics, a model of charging for consumption may make sense in many software categories (think Adobe charging per use of Firefly rather than monthly fee per employee). Feels like this will require a transition much like the the move from packaged software to SaaS. 4. Relegation risk: Real. The idea here is that someone could become the \"front end\" for all enterprise software, interfacing with the employee and directing requests to other services or incorporating those services. This feels real, even if you're a system of record: imagine Microsoft dis-intermediating Workday, for example, by having copilot take care of HR related requests. 5. Content generation risk: Real. The idea here is that products that primarily output or help employees output content are at risk from the models themselves. I think this one is real too; a company like Adobe is at risk here. Given all of this, I think it's possible to take a software name and evaluate its relative risk. I've done it for a bunch of names [here]( **Which software companies do you think are undervalued?**",

Given this with increasing supply of software it seems like competitive advantages like distribution channels brand and lockin will continue to be important . So many current leaders probably continue to win here . 3 . Seat model risk Real but not_catastrophic . The idea here is that SaaS companies have overoptimized on charging per seat but with potential reductions in headcount and generative AI computing economics a model of charging for consumption may make sense in many software categories think Adobe charging per use of Firefly rather than monthly fee per employee . Feels like this will require a transition much like the the move from packaged software to SaaS . 4 . Relegation risk Real . The idea here is that someone could become the front end for all enterprise software interfacing with the employee and directing requests to other services or incorporating those services . This feels real even if youre a system of record imagine Microsoft disintermediating Workday for example by having copilot take care of HR related requests . 5 . Content generation risk Real . The idea here is that products that primarily output or help employees output content are at risk from the models themselves . I think this one is real too a company like Adobe is at risk here . Given all of this I think its possible to take a software name and evaluate its relative risk . Ive done it for a bunch of names here Which software companies do you think are undervalued"

      "selftext": "My weekly take on some stock ideas from this week's issue of Barron's Magazine which hits the newsstands on Monday. (With the holidays coming up, the picks were pretty light this week, so I had to reach for a couple of them.) **BURL** Burlington Stores is the stock pick of the week. Barron's cites that BURL has been a laggard among the off-price retail stores, despite a very high 30% growth rate and taking share from competitors TJMaxx and Ross. Burlington has put some recent execution issues behind it and it is a good time to buy with the lowest P/E among peers and the stock down for the year. **LLY/NVO** Jack Hough, one of my favorite writers, highlights the good year ahead for the GLP-1 makers, and particularly cites the lead that Eli Lilly has built. But my takeaway is the more important insight that Novo Nordisk is about to have their oral GLP-1 approved by January, and they will have a substantial advantage in this head start and the fact that their pill has done significantly better than Lilly's in current studies on weight loss. NVO is the contrarian pick here. **CORT** In an article about top performing fund managers this year, it jumped out at me that one of the funds, Tanaka Growth, had 15% of its portfolio in a single stock--Corcept Therapeutics (CORT). Corcept has a hit drug to treat Cushing's disease, but more importantly it has a potential blockbuster drug to treat ovarian cancer which could be approved this year. Tanaka thinks the stock could rise 150% over the next year or two.",

Same feeling of “this is taking off.” But one is the beginning of a run. The other is the last gasp before it dumps. They’re visually identical. That’s the problem. The way I’ve found to tell them apart: Watch what happens in the 2-3 days AFTER the breakout.

The growth was partly from strong demand in its Cloud Memory business unit, where revenue increased 100% year-over-year. Management provided Q2 revenue guidance of $18.7 billion, or 37% quarter-over-quarter growth. For the full fiscal year, the average forecast of 30 Wall Street analysts, as reported in Yahoo Finance, is $73.8 billion, or 97% year-over-year growth. I created a valuation analysis model to see if MU could be a good Buy: [MU Valuation Analysis]( Adding the projected revenue growth and trailing operating margin provides 130 Value Points. My minimum required Value Points is 40, which represents the top 15% of publicly traded stocks. The current Enterprise Value of MU is $300.2 billion, based on Friday’s closing stock price of $265.92. This is 12.7 times the projected operating income of $23.6 billion. My Value Score calculation is 130/12.7, or 10.2. My minimum required Value Score for a Buy consideration is 2.0. Given MU’s growing capital expenditure investments, I replaced operating income with unlevered free cash flow in the model. The adjusted Value Score came in at 5.5, still solidly in Buy territory. MU looks like a strong Buy to me, and I bought some shares on Thursday. As always, please do your own research before making any investment decision.",

      "selftext": "I've been watching this space closely and something interesting is happening with tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs on blockchain platforms. Ondo Finance, which handles the actual tokenization (backing them 1:1 with real shares), got some good news earlier this month when the SEC closed a long-running investigation without any charges. That cleared up a big overhang. Around the same time, their partnership with Bitget really started showing results as the exchange handled over $88 million in trading volume for these Ondo tokens in the first week of December alone, grabbing about 73% of the total market share. They've since pushed past $500 million cumulative with over 100+ different U.S stock. names like Apple or Tesla among top. Is this basically a way for non-U.S. folks to get exposure to stocks without opening a traditional brokerage account? what baffles me is the trading volumes which suggest people are actually using it.",

Ondo Finance which handles the actual tokenization backing them 11 with real shares got some good news earlier this month when the SEC closed a longrunning investigation without any charges . That cleared up a big overhang . Around the same time their partnership with Bitget really started showing results as the exchange handled over $ 88 million in trading volume for these Ondo tokens in the first week of December alone grabbing about 73 % of the total market share . Theyve since pushed past $ 500 million cumulative with over 100 different U.S stock . names like Apple or Tesla among top . Is this basically a way for nonU.S . folks to get exposure to stocks without opening a traditional brokerage account what baffles me is the trading volumes which suggest people are actually using it ."

      "selftext": "Hi, I've been throwing money at a 401k since I turned 18 and, even with maxing out contributions, am not exactly where I think I should be so I'm turning my sights elsewhere, namely my rainy day fund. I have two accounts, one for true \"oh shit\" moments ($10k) and the other in case I get laid off since I'm in tech ($40k). The $40k I have is in a HYSA at 3.3% that I haven't had to look at even remotely (knocking on wood). A thread here caught my eye asking about the catch of investing in SPY and it doesn't really seem like there is one. At this point, since I have a true emergency fund, would it be better to pull everything out of my HYSA and invest it into SPY or something else for the long-run? To throw a little wrench into things, I also have this weird feeling that shit is **really** going to hit the fan soon here in the US economically but I've been comically wrong so far. I've been a lurker here on and off for some time and I'm well aware that trying to time the market is almost 100% of the time a losing endeavor but I'm not sure if there's anything on the horizon that might be a catalyst that I should wait for. If I should keep it parked in a HYSA and just mess around with where my 401k is invested I'm a-okay with that, or if it would be smart to start looking at overseas Index funds I can do that too. Just not exactly sure where to go and looking for guidance. Thanks! Edit: Thanks, realize this should be in not only Personal Finance but I'm going to keep these funds as a true combined emergency fund and invest everything else.",

      "title": "Is Tesla (TSLA) Poised for Another Breakout or Facing Resistance?",
      "selftext": "Tesla (TSLA) has been one of the most watched stocks in the market, and its recent price action is setting up some interesting trade opportunities. On the fundamental side, Tesla continues to dominate the EV market with strong deliveries, expanding Gigafactory production, and innovation in battery and autonomous driving technology. Its energy division provides additional diversification, though margins are under pressure from rising costs and increasing competition from EV peers like Rivian and Lucid. Analysts remain split on valuation: some see upside as Tesla captures more of the global EV market, while others warn that stretched multiples may leave little room for error if guidance or macro conditions slip. From a technical perspective, TSLA is currently testing resistance around **$310–$320**, which aligns with prior all-time highs. Support zones to watch are **$285–$290**, where the 50-day moving average and previous consolidation levels converge. RSI readings are approaching overbought territory, suggesting short-term caution, while strong volume on recent rallies indicates bullish momentum may still persist. Traders could look for breakouts above $320 with confirmation of volume for a potential momentum trade, or consider buying near $285–$290 with tight risk management if the stock retraces to support. For options traders, vertical spreads or protective puts could hedge against volatility while maintaining exposure to upside. In terms of strategy, long-term investors may focus on Tesla’s growth trajectory, while swing traders may exploit these technical levels for short-term plays. Macro factors such as interest rate expectations, EV incentives, and broader tech rotation will also influence price action. Personally, I’m monitoring TSLA alongside other large-cap EV and tech stocks to evaluate relative strength and potential rotation opportunities. I’d love to hear how others are approaching Tesla: Are you playing momentum, value, or hedging strategies? Which support and resistance levels are you watching, and how are you managing risk given the stock’s volatility?",

      "selftext_processed": "Tesla TSLA has been one of the most watched stocks in the market and its recent price action is setting up some interesting trade opportunities . On the fundamental side Tesla continues to dominate the EV market with strong deliveries expanding Gigafactory production and innovation in battery and autonomous driving technology . Its energy division provides additional diversification though margins are under pressure from rising costs and increasing competition from EV peers like Rivian and Lucid . Analysts remain split on valuation some see upside as Tesla captures more of the global EV market while others warn that stretched multiples may leave little room for error if guidance or macro conditions slip . From a technical perspective TSLA is currently testing resistance around $ 310– $ 320 which aligns with prior alltime highs . Support zones to watch are $ 285– $ 290 where the 50day moving average and previous consolidation levels converge . RSI readings are approaching overbought territory suggesting shortterm caution while strong volume on recent rallies indicates bullish momentum may still persist . Traders could look for breakouts above $ 320 with confirmation of volume for a potential momentum trade or consider buying near $ 285– $ 290 with tight risk management if the stock retraces to support . For options traders vertical spreads or protective puts could hedge against volatility while maintaining exposure to upside . In terms of strategy longterm investors may focus on Tesla ’ s growth trajectory while swing traders may exploit these technical levels for shortterm plays . Macro factors such as interest rate expectations EV incentives and broader tech rotation will also influence price action . Personally I ’ m monitoring TSLA alongside other largecap EV and tech stocks to evaluate relative strength and potential rotation opportunities . I ’ d love to hear how others are approaching Tesla Are you playing momentum value or hedging strategies Which support and resistance levels are you watching and how are you managing risk given the stock ’ s volatility"

The company’s owners and executives are also closely connected to the current administration, particularly Dana White and Donald Trump. Dana White’s recent appointment to Meta’s board highlights the untapped potential between sports entertainment, streaming, and technology. Looking ahead, I believe the UFC will continue expanding into more countries next year, opening up even larger global markets. The upcoming White House card could also showcase to the world how far MMA has come since its early days in the 1990s. Are there any TKO shareholders here?

The first day or two was a little disheartening, but it didn't go too deep in the red since the option had about 3 months left.

      "selftext": "So I see a lot of posts with people asking about retirement investment moves and as I'm reading the posts, the majority are already sitting on $500k, $1.5 million or more. Great! I'm happy for them but to the average person who doesn't make over $100k a year, how can one achieve this? It's never too late to start investing, I fully understand the concept. Are ETFs the answer? I read something that said at the age of 40, I would need to invest $4k a month to reach retirement and live comfortably. If I put $4k a month into investing I'd be living on the street and the family would go hungry. Is the move to gamble on a penny stock? I'm just genuinely curious to see what others would do. We can't turn back the clock and start investing young. What's the play? Thank you *Edit- Reading through the comments, there is some great insight and I do appreciate the time some of you are taking to share your thoughts. I'm thinking that outside of an RRSP (I'm in Canada), possibly an ETF such as XEQT or VEQT may be best suited for my situation as I am in Canada.

      "title": "PCT $120k YOLO - I’ve been early before",
      "selftext": "This one will likely go over this sub’s collective head, but I’d like to briefly highlight what I believe can become one of the best industrial growth companies in the market over the next 5ish years. I’ve been consolidating into my highest convictions recently (6 stocks now account for 80% of my port) and $PCT became one of my large long term bets (was a smaller position before) after the recent selloff, after what was a positive earnings call, that mostly driven by the recent high beta selloff + shorts ability to press down the price of a lower volume traded stock. IMO this should hopefully be my best most “boring” multi bagger in my long term portfolio. For those unfamiliar, PureCycle is a company focused on commercializing their patented recycling technology that turns waste polypropylene into ultra pure recycled resin, that is essentially as good as virgin plastic. Their stock has been on a roller coaster the last few years, but they have been quietly building out and ramping up their Ironton, Ohio plant. That plant is the “proof” for the number of large customers currently doing trials and evaluating product. Customers are also currently positioning themselves for future capacity tied to the Augusta, GA and the 3 other planned international plants (more planned for the future). PCT is currently supporting trials so that by the time Asia and Europe come online, those plants are already spoken for. Making big enterprise decisions don’t happen overnight and all of PCTs large customers are going through the standard processes to trial and verify the product for themselves. I should also state that PCT has a longstanding relationship with P&G, so this is not just a small company that has been developing a rogue new technology unchecked. I believe one of the larger current overhangs is on the regulatory side. Large customers are waiting for that to officially clear before placing their POs because they’re not going to want to place orders until they are certain it’s officially designated as a “recycled” material. Progress is being made there and should hopefully see resolution in the short term. Lots of companies already have sustainability mandates but there is not enough supply to meet their demand. Thus, these companies currently have to spend that money on credits that cost up to $.80/lb. This means that PCT will not only be able to meet a supply/demand gap but also potentially provide pricing that is in-line with what these companies are spending on credits already. PCT also recently added a tremendous resource to their board, Val Mars, who is the 4th generation previous executive of the largest candy company in the world whose company culture has been leaning heavily into sustainable recycling. MARS could sell out the entire Ironton facility on their own if they so chose. Any future partnerships with MARS aside, upon joining the board, Val was quoted saying “It was great to witness sustainability in action at the Ironton Facility and to see how this innovative technology can give curbside waste a new life. As a champion of sustainability I look forward to helping guide PureCycle into the next phase of their growth”. From a personal standpoint as a long term AST holder, this reminds me of the early days when Chris Sambar (ATT executive) joined their board and was a big source of credibility/validity to the market. The Ironton plant is really the overall thesis maker right now imo. When proven out, which should hopefully not be too long, all the future plants will simply be pit stops on their way to massive scaling. Some future potential valuation thoughts: After the Augusta plant is operational, they could be doing as much as $1/lb in EBITDA. If the company is selling over 1 billion lbs then we can fairly assume a multiple of 25-30x. That would mean that with just the 4 plants expected operational by 2030 (Ironton, Augusta, Thailand, Antwerp), PCT is potentially a $25/30 billion company with a roadmap to recycling as much as 20-30 bln lbs per year. TLDR: One of the old school SPACS that’s actually a real company, but like many old SPACS it is hated and cast aside/low volume ignored. They are in the late innings of proving out the thesis and hopefully closing regulatory hurdles soon. If they execute their vision I can see this being a 10-20X from the current $1.5B MC valuation within the next 3-5ish years and if you squint hard enough I can almost see a world where it is 25-50X from here if the entire roadmap works out as planned. They’re a green, US company, so the politics should be favorable in the long run as well. I think just longing shares is best as the options chain doesn’t have much volume but I do have a small 2026 call position open as well.

      "selftext_processed": "This one will likely go over this sub ’ s collective head but I ’ d like to briefly highlight what I believe can become one of the best industrial growth companies in the market over the next 5ish years . I ’ ve been consolidating into my highest convictions recently 6 stocks now account for 80 % of my port and $ PCT became one of my large long term bets was a smaller position before after the recent selloff after what was a positive earnings call that mostly driven by the recent high beta selloff shorts ability to press down the price of a lower volume traded stock . IMO this should hopefully be my best most “ boring ” multi bagger in my long term portfolio . For those unfamiliar PureCycle is a company focused on commercializing their patented recycling technology that turns waste polypropylene into ultra pure recycled resin that is essentially as good as virgin plastic . Their stock has been on a roller coaster the last few years but they have been quietly building out and ramping up their Ironton Ohio plant . That plant is the “ proof ” for the number of large customers currently doing trials and evaluating product . Customers are also currently positioning themselves for future capacity tied to the Augusta GA and the 3 other planned international plants more planned for the future . PCT is currently supporting trials so that by the time Asia and Europe come online those plants are already spoken for . Making big enterprise decisions don ’ t happen overnight and all of PCTs large customers are going through the standard processes to trial and verify the product for themselves . I should also state that PCT has a longstanding relationship with PG so this is not_just a small company that has been developing a rogue new technology unchecked . I believe one of the larger current overhangs is on the regulatory side . Large customers are waiting for that to officially clear before placing their POs because they ’ re not_going to want to place orders until they are certain it ’ s officially designated as a “ recycled ” material . Progress is being made there and should hopefully see resolution in the short term . Lots of companies already have sustainability mandates but there is not_enough supply to meet their demand . Thus these companies currently have to spend that money on credits that cost up to $ .80lb . This means that PCT will not_only be able to meet a supplydemand gap but also potentially provide pricing that is inline with what these companies are spending on credits already . PCT also recently added a tremendous resource to their board Val Mars who is the 4th generation previous executive of the largest candy company in the world whose company culture has been leaning heavily into sustainable recycling . MARS could sell out the entire Ironton facility on their own if they so chose . Any future partnerships with MARS aside upon joining the board Val was quoted saying “ It was great to witness sustainability in action at the Ironton Facility and to see how this innovative technology can give curbside waste a new life . As a champion of sustainability I look forward to helping guide PureCycle into the next phase of their growth ” . From a personal standpoint as a long term AST holder this reminds me of the early days when Chris Sambar ATT executive joined their board and was a big source of credibilityvalidity to the market . The Ironton plant is really the overall thesis maker right now imo . When proven out which should hopefully not_be too long all the future plants will simply be pit stops on their way to massive scaling . Some future potential valuation thoughts After the Augusta plant is operational they could be doing as much as $ 1lb in EBITDA . If the company is selling over 1 billion lbs then we can fairly assume a multiple of 2530x . That would mean that with just the 4 plants expected operational by 2030 Ironton Augusta Thailand Antwerp PCT is potentially a $ 2530 billion company with a roadmap to recycling as much as 2030 bln lbs per year . TLDR One of the old school SPACS that ’ s actually a real company but like many old SPACS it is hated and cast asidelow volume ignored . They are in the late innings of proving out the thesis and hopefully closing regulatory hurdles soon . If they execute their vision I can see this being a 1020X from the current $ 1.5B MC valuation within the next 35ish years and if you squint hard enough I can almost see a world where it is 2550X from here if the entire roadmap works out as planned . They ’ re a green US company so the politics should be favorable in the long run as well . I think just longing shares is best as the options chain doesn ’ t have much volume but I do have a small 2026 call position open as well . Best of luck out there regards 10500 shares 40 x 326 calls “ Think left and think right think low and think high oh the thinks you can think up if only you try ” Dr Seuss"

My question is how should I approach entering the market right now? Should I continue to DCA, lump sum it, or some hybrid approach? My worry is a drastic market pullback. I know time in the market beats timing the market but when I’m going to rely on the money for the next year or two how do you think about that in safety terms.

At the moment I only have 22k in VUAG and 10k in VWRP but plan to go 100% VWRP going forward as there's already 60% overlap towards US. I'm based in the UK, investing in a Stocks ISA with trading 212 and have currently maxed out my ISA allowance this year. As I'm also invested into a Lifetime ISA, I'm therefore only limited to 16k per year towards Stocks but wondered if my portfolio is good for long term growth & returns or if I should add individual stocks to get higher returns? At the moment I've got a \"set and forget\" approach - ideally aiming for an earlier retirement at 55-60 years old but have started reading & listening to more things stock market related.",

At the moment I only have 22k in VUAG and 10k in VWRP but plan to go 100 % VWRP going forward as theres already 60 % overlap towards US . Im based in the UK investing in a Stocks ISA with trading 212 and have currently maxed out my ISA allowance this year . As Im also invested into a Lifetime ISA Im therefore only limited to 16k per year towards Stocks but wondered if my portfolio is good for long term growth returns or if I should add individual stocks to get higher returns At the moment Ive got a set and forget approach ideally aiming for an earlier retirement at 5560 years old but have started reading listening to more things stock market related ."

      "selftext": "TL;DR: RuneScape bond prices might predict S&P 500 movements 7 weeks in advance (r=0.43, p<0.001). Virtual economies may capture consumer sentiment shifts before traditional markets. This is either a fascinating alternative data source or the world's most elaborate coincidence. Further research needed. # Introduction I analyzed the relationship between RS3 bond prices and S&P 500 performance between Dec. 2020 - Dec. 2025. The data suggests something unexpected: virtual economy movements may actually predict traditional stock market changes. RS3 bond price movements consistently lead S&P 500 changes by approximately 49 days, suggesting that virtual economies might capture early signals of consumer sentiment before they appear in traditional markets. # Methods **Data Processing Steps:** 1. Daily price data extracted for both RuneScape 3 bonds (via WeirdGloop API) and S&P 500 (via quantmod) 2. Inner join performed to ensure date alignment 3. Returns calculated as percentage changes: r\\_t = (P\\_t / P\\_(t-1) - 1) × 100 4. Rolling windows applied for trend and volatility calculations 5. Normalization performed using min-max scaling for visualization # Results **Key Findings:** * RS3 bond price movements consistently precede S&P 500 changes by 49 days (r = 0.428, p < 0.001) * Predictive relationship has strengthened since 2022, suggesting increasing reliability as virtual economies mature * RS3 economy is 2.2x more volatile than the S&P 500 (daily SD: 2.35% vs 1.09%) * This higher volatility may make RS3 a more sensitive early-warning system for broader economic sentiment shifts [Normalized 90-day moving averages showing RS3 bonds leading S&P 500 movements by approximately49 days.]( [Cross-correlation function revealing peak correlation at -49-day lag, indicating RS3 bonds leadS&P 500 by 49 days.]( [30-day rolling volatility showing virtual economy as a more sensitive early-warning system.]( The rolling correlation analysis shows that this predictive relationship **strengthened significantly post-2022**, potentially due to growing integration of gaming into mainstream consumer behavior. [90-day rolling correlation showing strengthening predictive relationship over time.]( Both markets exhibit fat-tailed distributions, with RS3 bonds showing significantly wider tails. This amplification of sentiment signals, combined with the 49-day lead time, creates a potentially valuable early warning system. [Distribution of daily returns showing RS3’s fat-tailed nature as an amplified sentiment indicator.]( # Trading Strategy Based on these trends, the report outlines specific signal rules for portfolio positioning using RS3 data: **BUY Signal (Increase S&P 500 Exposure):** * When: RS3 bond 30-day moving average increases by ≥3% * Action: Begin accumulating S&P 500 exposure starting 10-20 days after RS3 signal * Expected Outcome: S&P 500 likely to appreciate around Day 49 * Success Rate: 63.3% (based on historical backtesting) **SELL Signal (Reduce S&P 500 Exposure):** * When: RS3 bond 30-day moving average decreases by ≥3% * Action: Begin reducing S&P 500 exposure starting 10-20 days after RS3 signal * Expected Outcome: S&P 500 likely to decline around Day 49 * Success Rate: 39.1% (inverse - signals to avoid market) **HOLD Signal:** * When: RS3 bond moves less than ±3% over 30 days * Action: Maintain current allocation * Rationale: Insufficient signal strength # Software and Environment **Core Tools:** * R 4.3.0 * R Markdown * XeLaTeX * Claude Sonnet 4.5 for coding assistance **R Packages:** * quantmod * tidyverse * jsonlite * lubridate * zoo * ggplot2 * gridExtra * httr * knitr * kableExtra * scales",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR RuneScape bond prices might predict SP 500 movements 7 weeks in advance r0.43 p0.001 . Virtual economies may capture consumer sentiment shifts before traditional markets . This is either a fascinating alternative data source or the worlds most elaborate coincidence . Further research needed . Introduction I analyzed the relationship between RS3 bond prices and SP 500 performance between Dec. 2020 Dec. 2025 . The data suggests something unexpected virtual economy movements may actually predict traditional stock market changes . RS3 bond price movements consistently lead SP 500 changes by approximately 49 days suggesting that virtual economies might capture early signals of consumer sentiment before they appear in traditional markets . Methods Data Processing Steps 1 . Daily price data extracted for both RuneScape 3 bonds via WeirdGloop API and SP 500 via quantmod 2 . Inner join performed to ensure date alignment 3 . Returns calculated as percentage changes r_t P_t P_t1 1 × 100 4 . Rolling windows applied for trend and volatility calculations 5 . Normalization performed using minmax scaling for visualization Results Key Findings RS3 bond price movements consistently precede SP 500 changes by 49 days r 0.428 p 0.001 Predictive relationship has strengthened since 2022 suggesting increasing reliability as virtual economies mature RS3 economy is 2.2x more volatile than the SP 500 daily SD 2.35 % vs 1.09 % This higher volatility may make RS3 a more sensitive earlywarning system for broader economic sentiment shifts Normalized 90day moving averages showing RS3 bonds leading SP 500 movements by approximately49 days . Crosscorrelation function revealing peak correlation at 49day lag indicating RS3 bonds leadSP 500 by 49 days . 30day rolling volatility showing virtual economy as a more sensitive earlywarning system . The rolling correlation analysis shows that this predictive relationship strengthened significantly post2022 potentially due to growing integration of gaming into mainstream consumer behavior . 90day rolling correlation showing strengthening predictive relationship over time . Both markets exhibit fattailed distributions with RS3 bonds showing significantly wider tails . This amplification of sentiment signals combined with the 49day lead time creates a potentially valuable early warning system . Distribution of daily returns showing RS3 ’ s fattailed nature as an amplified sentiment indicator . Trading Strategy Based on these trends the report outlines specific signal rules for portfolio positioning using RS3 data BUY Signal Increase SP 500 Exposure When RS3 bond 30day moving average increases by ≥3 % Action Begin accumulating SP 500 exposure starting 1020 days after RS3 signal Expected Outcome SP 500 likely to appreciate around Day 49 Success Rate 63.3 % based on historical backtesting SELL Signal Reduce SP 500 Exposure When RS3 bond 30day moving average decreases by ≥3 % Action Begin reducing SP 500 exposure starting 1020 days after RS3 signal Expected Outcome SP 500 likely to decline around Day 49 Success Rate 39.1 % inverse signals to avoid market HOLD Signal When RS3 bond moves less than ±3 % over 30 days Action Maintain current allocation Rationale Insufficient signal strength Software and Environment Core Tools R 4.3.0 R Markdown XeLaTeX Claude Sonnet 4.5 for coding assistance R Packages quantmod tidyverse jsonlite lubridate zoo ggplot2 gridExtra httr knitr kableExtra scales"

      "selftext": "Lately I’ve been comparing two very different sectors: Microsoft ($MSFT) vs Procter & Gamble ($PG). Both are strong companies, but the risk/reward and growth narratives are very different. Microsoft highlights: • Cloud growth continues with Azure • AI integration could accelerate revenue across Office, search, and enterprise solutions • Forward P/E ~30x, strong margins, massive cash flow • Risks: Competition in AI/Cloud, macro slowdown Procter & Gamble highlights: • Steady revenue from consumer staples • Inflation-resistant products and strong pricing power • Forward P/E ~25x, lower growth but stable cash flow • Risks: Slower growth, sensitivity to commodity costs My take: Tech ($MSFT) offers more upside with AI tailwinds but comes with higher volatility. Consumer staples ($PG) are defensive, lower risk, but growth is limited. A balanced portfolio might include both, but I’m curious what this community thinks about positioning for 2026.",

      "selftext": "Moderna still trades like a “pandemic leftover,” but the fundamentals and global environment tell a much different story. A lot of major catalysts are starting to stack at the same time, and the market hasn’t fully caught up. 1. Pharma valuations are elevated, and M&A appetite is rising Big pharma is sitting on cash and facing steep patent cliffs. With valuations stretched across legacy pharma, innovative biotech platforms look increasingly attractive. Moderna has scalable tech, validated regulatory pathways, and a global footprint which makes it a logical strategic target if M&A ramps in 2026. 2. COVID and flu demand is stabilizing into a predictable seasonal model The market still prices Moderna like a declining pandemic play, but COVID is sliding into a steady seasonal pattern similar to flu. Combined COVID/flu vaccines have the potential to generate recurring annual revenue once results land. 3. Cancer vaccine development keeps gaining momentum The individualized neoantigen cancer vaccine program is one of the most watched programs in oncology. Early results were strong, phase 3 studies are underway, and oncology could become a major revenue driver. If approvals come through, this alone forces a valuation rethink. 4. Global regulators are moving independently. A huge underappreciated catalyst Europe, the UK, Australia, Canada, and Japan/Korea are increasingly making their own regulatory calls instead of waiting on the FDA. These regions are shifting toward more science-first healthcare policies. For a global company like Moderna, that means faster paths to market, diversified approval risk, and earlier revenue realization. 5. Global investment in next-gen biotech platforms Governments are putting real money behind pandemic preparedness, mRNA technology, and precision medicine. Moderna sits right at the center of those initiatives. My take: When you stack all this together, the $200 thesis doesn’t sound far-fetched. The market still prices Moderna like it has one product. The pipeline and regulatory landscape suggest otherwise. On the short interest side… Sentiment has been overwhelmingly negative, and short interest has been sticky for months. If any combination of oncology data, seasonal vaccine stability, or accelerated ex-US approvals hits at the same time, pessimism could unwind quickly. Not predicting fireworks, but the setup is there for a meaningful sentiment reversal if catalysts land. Curious what everyone thinks: Which catalyst hits first? Oncology readouts? Seasonal vaccine clarity? Faster ex-US approvals?",

      "selftext_processed": "Moderna still trades like a “ pandemic leftover ” but the fundamentals and global environment tell a much different story . A lot of major catalysts are starting to stack at the same time and the market hasn ’ t fully caught up . 1 . Pharma valuations are elevated and MA appetite is rising Big pharma is sitting on cash and facing steep patent cliffs . With valuations stretched across legacy pharma innovative biotech platforms look increasingly attractive . Moderna has scalable tech validated regulatory pathways and a global footprint which makes it a logical strategic target if MA ramps in 2026 . 2 . COVID and flu demand is stabilizing into a predictable seasonal model The market still prices Moderna like a declining pandemic play but COVID is sliding into a steady seasonal pattern similar to flu . Combined COVIDflu vaccines have the potential to generate recurring annual revenue once results land . 3 . Cancer vaccine development keeps gaining momentum The individualized neoantigen cancer vaccine program is one of the most watched programs in oncology . Early results were strong phase 3 studies are underway and oncology could become a major revenue driver . If approvals come through this alone forces a valuation rethink . 4 . Global regulators are moving independently . A huge underappreciated catalyst Europe the UK Australia Canada and JapanKorea are increasingly making their own regulatory calls instead of waiting on the FDA . These regions are shifting toward more sciencefirst healthcare policies . For a global company like Moderna that means faster paths to market diversified approval risk and earlier revenue realization . 5 . Global investment in nextgen biotech platforms Governments are putting real money behind pandemic preparedness mRNA technology and precision medicine . Moderna sits right at the center of those initiatives . My take When you stack all this together the $ 200 thesis doesn ’ t sound farfetched . The market still prices Moderna like it has one product . The pipeline and regulatory landscape suggest otherwise . On the short interest side… Sentiment has been overwhelmingly negative and short interest has been sticky for months . If any combination of oncology data seasonal vaccine stability or accelerated exUS approvals hits at the same time pessimism could unwind quickly . Not_predicting fireworks but the setup is there for a meaningful sentiment reversal if catalysts land . Curious what everyone thinks Which catalyst hits first Oncology readouts Seasonal vaccine clarity Faster exUS approvals"

      "selftext": "This may be dumb and too simple, but I can’t understand putting say $10k on a football game with a point spread you have to beat and risking 100% of that investment. Oftentimes to win less than 100% return. I can invest in an individual stock and set a stop loss at say 10% and only lose $1000, not $10,000. I’m mostly invested in index ETFs but sometimes invest in stocks (literally bought RKLB a couple weeks ago at $47 after hearing about it at a party lol) and always set a trailing stop loss of 10% or so. It’s like if I bet on the Seahawks and they went down 24-0 at halftime, it’s the equivalent of taking a 10% loss instead of losing it all. So don’t get why people bet on sports as it’s terrible odds. And there’s tons of people with gambling problems who have lost it all. Maybe it’s more fun people think they know more about football than stocks which is fair. And I acknowledge you can get extremely leveraged and put no risk mitigation strategies in stocks, but at least they’re there and easily implemented. I dunno, just a random thought before Xmas. Let me have all the reasons I’m wrong lol.",

Oftentimes to win less than 100 % return . I can invest in an individual stock and set a stop loss at say 10 % and only lose $ 1000 not_ $ 10000 . I ’ m mostly invested in index ETFs but sometimes invest in stocks literally bought RKLB a couple weeks ago at $ 47 after hearing about it at a party lol and always set a trailing stop loss of 10 % or so . It ’ s like if I bet on the Seahawks and they went down 240 at halftime it ’ s the equivalent of taking a 10 % loss instead of losing it all . So don ’ t get why people bet on sports as it ’ s terrible odds . And there ’ s tons of people with gambling problems who have lost it all . Maybe it ’ s more fun people think they know more about football than stocks which is fair . And I acknowledge you can get extremely leveraged and put no_risk mitigation strategies in stocks but at least they ’ re there and easily implemented . I dunno just a random thought before Xmas . Let me have all the reasons I ’ m wrong lol ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been researching $UBER and believe the stock is significantly oversold due to excessive fear that autonomous vehicles will soon destroy the ride-hailing business. This mirrors the situation with $GOOG earlier this year, when panic over ChatGPT and generative AI led to a sharp sell-off on concerns that search market share would vanish overnight. In reality, Google integrated AI into its products, preserved its moat, and the stock recovered as the threat proved premature. A similar dynamic is at play with Uber. The prevailing narrative assumes robotaxis will scale rapidly and obsolete human drivers, collapsing Uber’s commission model. However, widespread autonomous adoption faces major regulatory, safety, and cost barriers, making meaningful disruption likely 5–10 years away. Uber’s powerful network effects remain intact in the meantime, and the company is proactively partnering with AV leaders like Waymo while positioning its app as the primary interface for both human and autonomous rides. A major risk for all rideshare companies is lack of customer loyalty. The vast majority of ride share users have multiple apps and will use the option that meets the right mix of affordability and convenience at that given moment. I see this as a major advantage to Uber since they are the most widespread and have the most robust infrastructure to be able to provide the most low cost and convenient option. I recently traveled to multiple countries in South America and Uber was everywhere and cheaper than all alternatives. Additional growth drivers include continued expansion in Uber Eats with improving margins, scaling advertising and freight segments, and sustained profitability progress. At current valuations, the growth runway appears attractive if AV timelines extend even modestly. I’m long $UBER and adding on dips. Open to counterpoints on AV adoption speed or other risks.",

      "selftext": "Both NVDA and AMD peaked on October 29th and have since pulled back: - NVDA: Down ~17% from $212 to ~$175 - AMD: Down ~21% from $267 to ~$211 Both are showing oversold signals. But they're very different bets. **The quick comparison:** | Metric | NVDA | AMD | |--------|------|-----| | Forward P/E | 25x | ~42x | | Gross Margin | 75% | 54% | | Data Center Revenue | $51B/quarter | $4.3B/quarter | | AI Market Share | 80-90% | ~10% | | YTD Return | +39% | +99% | | RSI | ~33 (oversold) | ~39 (approaching) | **The case for NVDA:** - Dominant position (80-90% market share) - CUDA moat - developers are locked in - Forward P/E of 25x is actually reasonable for 50%+ growth - Better margins = more pricing power - RSI in oversold territory **The case for AMD:** - OpenAI partnership validates their chips for enterprise AI - Faster revenue growth - If they capture even 20% market share, stock doubles - Already outperformed NVDA 2.5x this year **The concerns:** - NVDA: Customer concentration, China export limits, competition catching up - AMD: ~40x adjusted P/E (GAAP inflated by Xilinx amortization) requires flawless execution, CUDA switching costs are real, still 10x smaller in data center revenue **My take:** At current prices, NVDA looks like better risk/reward. You're paying 25x forward earnings for the dominant player during a technical pullback. AMD is a great company at a rich valuation. The OpenAI deal is huge, but ~40x adjusted P/E prices in a lot of optimism. I'd want a deeper pullback to $180-195 before getting aggressive. If holding both: 70/30 NVDA/AMD makes sense. What's your take - is AMD's growth worth the premium, or is NVDA the safer bet here?",

      "selftext": "The stock market is seeing a lot of chop in the more popular sectors like A.I. despite earnings beats. In a prediction market - you wouldnt make much by predicting an obvious beat, or an obviously profitable year. But you can make enough now to outpeform the sp500 or even investing in those companies directly. For example, the old school of thought was, if a company is profitable and its financials are clean, its stock would suredly rise. But this isnt how the stock market works anymore. Teslas balance sheet looked way worse than fords yet as fords stock price went down, tesla skyrocketed. Now the same is holding true for many other stocks as well, and this is all thanks to hedging and excess options activity, turning the market into a giant casino instead of an instrument of debt as was intended. Thus, the rise of prediction markets. Take blackberry for example, double earnings beat and the stock loses substantial value immediately due to over leveraging - no fault of the company or shareholders. Meanwhile, a bullish player in the prediction market walked away with an actual profit by betting the company would beat earnings. While one is a marginalized loss (the stock) and the other is total loss, the position sizing eliminates this discrepancy. A shareholder of blackberry loses 13% on a double beat - that 13% lost had the same profitibality as the entire investment in the prediction market 3-fold. Which brings me to my next point - diversification. Eventually someone will work out the math and create a firm based entirely on prediction markets using the same diversified/model based portfolios which exist in the stock market, betting on 100's of companies to be profitable or not YOY. This is going to be so toxic for the economy becouse it takes money out of the instrument of debt and puts it into a market where the only 2 winners are the broker and the contract holders compared to the stock market where the third winner is the company whos equity increases with higher participancy. Unfortunatley, with the amount of leveraging, insider trading, and nonsensical market moves happening in the stock market, a future of prediction market dominance is all but guaranteed.",

      "selftext_processed": "The stock market is seeing a lot of chop in the more popular sectors like A.I . despite earnings beats . In a prediction market you wouldnt make much by predicting an obvious beat or an obviously profitable year . But you can make enough now to outpeform the sp500 or even investing in those companies directly . For example the old school of thought was if a company is profitable and its financials are clean its stock would suredly rise . But this isnt how the stock market works anymore . Teslas balance sheet looked way worse than fords yet as fords stock price went down tesla skyrocketed . Now the same is holding true for many other stocks as well and this is all thanks to hedging and excess options activity turning the market into a giant casino instead of an instrument of debt as was intended . Thus the rise of prediction markets . Take blackberry for example double earnings beat and the stock loses substantial value immediately due to over leveraging no_fault of the company or shareholders . Meanwhile a bullish player in the prediction market walked away with an actual profit by betting the company would beat earnings . While one is a marginalized loss the stock and the other is total loss the position sizing eliminates this discrepancy . A shareholder of blackberry loses 13 % on a double beat that 13 % lost had the same profitibality as the entire investment in the prediction market 3fold . Which brings me to my next point diversification . Eventually someone will work out the math and create a firm based entirely on prediction markets using the same diversifiedmodel based portfolios which exist in the stock market betting on 100s of companies to be profitable or not_YOY . This is going to be so toxic for the economy becouse it takes money out of the instrument of debt and puts it into a market where the only 2 winners are the broker and the contract holders compared to the stock market where the third winner is the company whos equity increases with higher participancy . Unfortunatley with the amount of leveraging insider trading and nonsensical market moves happening in the stock market a future of prediction market dominance is all but guaranteed ."

      "selftext": "I wanted to try trading futures on Boeing (BA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) yesterday on Bitget. Boeing futures aren’t available there yet, but while digging deeper into BA, what stood out was how concerning the underlying credit picture looks compared to the equity narrative. Boeing’s total debt has reached roughly $53.3 billion, with a significant maturity wall approaching: about $4.3 billion due in 2025 and another $8 billion in 2026. Moody’s recently downgraded Boeing’s senior unsecured debt, citing concerns that free cash flow may fall short of covering these obligations, forcing the company to rely on refinancing or additional capital raising. [ In the bond market, several Boeing issues are starting to trade at levels more commonly associated with stressed periods. The 4.875% notes due May 2025 are yielding near levels last seen during past episodes of credit strain, while longer-dated bonds like the 5.805% 2050s have shown modest spread widening in recent trades. Boeing has secured a $3 billion credit facility to support liquidity, but this comes against the backdrop of long-term debt that has ballooned from under $10 billion a decade ago. While S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings currently maintain stable outlooks at BBB-, the lowest investment-grade tier, the scale of upcoming maturities raises questions about execution risk in a higher-for-longer rate environment. Leverage remains elevated, with funds from operations to debt projected around 20% next year, a level that leaves limited margin for error if deliveries slow or cash generation disappoints. *Edit:* S&P revised its outlook to stable in October, pointing to improving aircraft production. Moody’s downgrade, however, highlights a more cautious view on the timing and durability of Boeing’s cash flow recovery.",

      "selftext_processed": "I wanted to try trading futures on Boeing BA and NVIDIA NVDA yesterday on Bitget . Boeing futures aren ’ t available there yet but while digging deeper into BA what stood out was how concerning the underlying credit picture looks compared to the equity narrative . Boeing ’ s total debt has reached roughly $ 53.3 billion with a significant maturity wall approaching about $ 4.3 billion due in 2025 and another $ 8 billion in 2026 . Moody ’ s recently downgraded Boeing ’ s senior unsecured debt citing concerns that free cash flow may fall short of covering these obligations forcing the company to rely on refinancing or additional capital raising . In the bond market several Boeing issues are starting to trade at levels more commonly associated with stressed periods . The 4.875 % notes due May 2025 are yielding near levels last seen during past episodes of credit strain while longerdated bonds like the 5.805 % 2050s have shown modest spread widening in recent trades . Boeing has secured a $ 3 billion credit facility to support liquidity but this comes against the backdrop of longterm debt that has ballooned from under $ 10 billion a decade ago . While SP Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings currently maintain stable outlooks at BBB the lowest investmentgrade tier the scale of upcoming maturities raises questions about execution risk in a higherforlonger rate environment . Leverage remains elevated with funds from operations to debt projected around 20 % next year a level that leaves limited margin for error if deliveries slow or cash generation disappoints . Edit SP revised its outlook to stable in October pointing to improving aircraft production . Moody ’ s downgrade however highlights a more cautious view on the timing and durability of Boeing ’ s cash flow recovery ."

      "selftext": "**My basic non-AI write up** I've been looking at reducing tech exposure considering recent jitters and been sifting through stocks worth strong value propositions in infrastructure, finance and tech. Viagra stood out for me. Here is my rationale. Vistra stock is an energy play recently trading at a \\\\\\~20% discount from ATH, currently trading $160-170 from $219. Analyst targets range from Low (217) to High (256). Mean target $233 (implied 40% upside) Forward PE is quite reasonable. Trailing PE is v. high, with last quarter EPS miss due to non-operational accounting event. Year-on-Year increases in Revenue, Net Income, Net Profit Margin, annual EPS, EBITDA. ROC at 11%, above average, indicating successful reinvestment and growth prospects. Significant acquisitions this year: 7 natural gas plants, ongoing gas and solar build outs. Recently finalised 20-year contract/power supply agreement set to begin 2027. Amazon & Microsoft partnered solar build outs in progress. Lowering interest rates landscape acts as a tailwind to allow for cheaper debt and build out loan serviceability. Energy demand is set to increase in 2026 and onwards with increasing electrification (vehicular, technology, AI/data). Institutional investment is increasing AND recent, notably JP Morgan increased their VST position to \\\\\\~10,935,188 shares (buying an additional \\\\\\~2,074,364 shares, increasing portfolio holding by 23% at an approximated cost basis of $170-180 per share) in Q3 2025. Technical analysis shows solid support levels at $166, $160, big base at $150, based on Fibonacci retracements, and Bollinger bands. No foolproof sign of full bottom/floor, however recent bouncing off $160 line is confidence inspiring. \\--- Let's discuss folks! **Update:** **I did some digging when someone elsewhere mentioned Nancy Pelosi buying VST calls. Congressional Records show Nancy Pelosi bought $50 calls with 367 DTE on January 14, 2025, with underlying cost basis approximately $166. There is a chance she sold out at the $200 peak. But there is no disclosure of those positions being sold (which require disclosure) = technically she is still holding open call positions expiring January 2026 at an underlying basis of $166**",

      "selftext": "Hi! I’ve made some changes to my portfolio ahead of 2026. I’ve based my stock selection on future PEG ratios, where I want them to be close to 1 and preferably below 1 in the coming years. I’ve also looked at forward-looking P/E ratios, where I want to see a clear decline from today’s P/E. In addition to that, profitability and growth are, as usual, important to me. Growth is reflected in the valuation metrics mentioned above. (ICICI Bank is one of India’s largest banks; it has strong growth, and I also believe in India as a market.) I currently hold a total of 19 stocks, of which 7 are outside the US, i.e. about 36%. I have exposure to 7 different sectors: IT, communication services, industrials, financials, healthcare, energy, and consumer. The allocation across sectors follows proportions similar to those in global equity funds. I would appreciate tips and opinions on the valuations of the stocks: • Siemens Energy AG • Netflix • Microsoft • Amazon.com • Cencora • Lundin Gold • UniCredit SpA • Meta Platforms A • Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B • Micron Technology • Advanced Micro Devices • NVIDIA • Broadcom • Alphabet Inc Class C • Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg Co • Eli Lilly • ICICI Bank ADR • Investor B • Rhienmetall",

      "selftext": "Need some advice. I’m more of a trader in how I treat my portfolio. I’m constantly looking to make moves with approx. 50% of the portfolio. The other 50% is is Amazon with a cost average of $211. A few days ago I bought some core weave (about 7% worth of portfolio). I’m already up over 20% on it, and I know that this stock is highly volatile. Shortly after the ipo I bought at around $40 and sold it all at like $43.. was happy to make a few bucks and at the time I didn’t know a whole lot about their business. And then I watch it run all the way up to $185 and missed out on all of those potential gains. So my question is this, should I take the profits now with the 20%+ gain in only a few days? Or should I wait this one out in case it runs back up over $100 and keeps running from there.. possibly retests the highs of $185. Full disclaimer, I did sell about 15% pf the shares near the highs today, so this question is for the reminding 85% which I still own. Thanks in advance.",

The other 50 % is is Amazon with a cost average of $ 211 . A few days ago I bought some core weave about 7 % worth of portfolio . I ’ m already up over 20 % on it and I know that this stock is highly volatile . Shortly after the ipo I bought at around $ 40 and sold it all at like $ 43 .. was happy to make a few bucks and at the time I didn ’ t know a whole lot about their business . And then I watch it run all the way up to $ 185 and missed out on all of those potential gains . So my question is this should I take the profits now with the 20 % gain in only a few days Or should I wait this one out in case it runs back up over $ 100 and keeps running from there .. possibly retests the highs of $ 185 . Full disclaimer I did sell about 15 % pf the shares near the highs today so this question is for the reminding 85 % which I still own . Thanks in advance ."

What if this isn’t just a misjudge of financial? Larry Ellison, America’s second richest person with a $393 billion net worth, isn’t the type to mess up on financing. With decades running Oracle and political connections he’s too smart for that. I feel like it’s a calculated move. It might tie into the Genesis program.

Maybe it’s not distress; maybe it’s a signal for a bailout to lock in U.S. AI dominance over rivals like China. And comparing this to old CDS numbers may not make sense anymore. AI’s changed the game with all this debt funding, so past levels just may not be comparable. But who knows? Do you think Ellison’s working this behind closed doors with the government to turn market panic into a strategic win? Disclaimer: NFA. Yes, I hold ORCL.",

Cooked books, and the stock like a stonk meme possessed by gamma and short-covering. IV is screaming that something chaotic is coming, used car prices aren’t magic, and the whole thing feels held together by optimism and duct tape. Also, historically, whenever I short something it immediately goes higher, which means statistically I am now extremely due.

This isn ’ t a revolutionary tech company curing diseases or printing money with AI it ’ s a used car dealer with a website a mountain of debt and customers who is already poor and defaults for shits and giggles . Cooked books and the stock like a stonk meme possessed by gamma and shortcovering . IV is screaming that something chaotic is coming used car prices aren ’ t magic and the whole thing feels held together by optimism and duct tape . Also historically whenever I short something it immediately goes higher which means statistically I am now extremely due .

      "selftext": "25M seeking perspectives on leveraged ETFs, i.e. UPRO (3x leveraged S&P500). I’ve been investing for 3 years now. My strategy involves Dollar Cost Averaging into low cost broad ETFs like VOO/VT. I have a strong rainy day fund of 1 year expenses in cash in HYSA, along with seemingly steady employment, and 50% savings rate/cash flow. Due to my young age and very long time horizon (20-40 years), I’m very comfortable taking slightly more risk in my portfolio while I am young. I’m interested in adding some leverage to my portfolio, perhaps around 5-15%. I’ve been reading about leveraged ETFs and I understand the risks as well as the downsides like volatility drag/decay experienced on volatile assets in leveraged ETFs over the long run. Over this last year I’ve probably watched this video by Ben Felix about 5 times: [Investing with Leverage (Borrowing to Invest, Leveraged ETFs)]( I’ve also consulted LLMs as well as blogs from on this topic and it has really made me want to consider adding a slight amount of leverage to my portfolio. I’m well aware that we are in an “interesting” market to say the least. One that is very volatile and wouldn’t be surprising to experience a 10-15% correction within the next 2 years (which would be a 30-45% correction in 3x leverage). I’m completely comfortable with this and doesn’t intimidate my conviction in the market. With all that said, I’m curious to ask the community about their opinions on Leveraged ETFs - If you own shares in one, what has your experience been, would you recommend it? - Due to potential returns, is it better to add this position in a tax advantaged ROTH IRA vs a traditional brokerage? - Is it asinine/very stupid to hold a leveraged ETF position for 10+ years due to the volatility drag/decay? Or any other thoughts comments, thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "25M seeking perspectives on leveraged ETFs i.e . UPRO 3x leveraged SP500 . I ’ ve been investing for 3 years now . My strategy involves Dollar Cost Averaging into low cost broad ETFs like VOOVT . I have a strong rainy day fund of 1 year expenses in cash in HYSA along with seemingly steady employment and 50 % savings ratecash flow . Due to my young age and very long time horizon 2040 years I ’ m very comfortable taking slightly more risk in my portfolio while I am young . I ’ m interested in adding some leverage to my portfolio perhaps around 515 % . I ’ ve been reading about leveraged ETFs and I understand the risks as well as the downsides like volatility dragdecay experienced on volatile assets in leveraged ETFs over the long run . Over this last year I ’ ve probably watched this video by Ben Felix about 5 times Investing with Leverage Borrowing to Invest Leveraged ETFs I ’ ve also consulted LLMs as well as blogs from on this topic and it has really made me want to consider adding a slight amount of leverage to my portfolio . I ’ m well aware that we are in an “ interesting ” market to say the least . One that is very volatile and wouldn ’ t be surprising to experience a 1015 % correction within the next 2 years which would be a 3045 % correction in 3x leverage . I ’ m completely comfortable with this and doesn ’ t intimidate my conviction in the market . With all that said I ’ m curious to ask the community about their opinions on Leveraged ETFs If you own shares in one what has your experience been would you recommend it Due to potential returns is it better to add this position in a tax advantaged ROTH IRA vs a traditional brokerage Is it asininevery stupid to hold a leveraged ETF position for 10 years due to the volatility dragdecay Or any other thoughts comments thanks"

      "selftext": "Hi, I’m looking for some input on a small satellite allocation within an otherwise simple, long-term portfolio (core is a broad global ETF with ongoing DCA). My satellites currently include Google (GOOG), Nvidia (NVDA), and Broadcom (AVGO), but together they only make up a small % of my total portfolio. Given that limited size, I’m wondering: Does it make more sense to concentrate on 1–2 names instead of holding all three? For a 10–15 year horizon, which would you prioritize: Google (diversified cash machine + AI optionality), or Nvidia (AI leader, higher growth but more cyclicality/valuation risk)? Where does Broadcom fit for long-term conviction? This isn’t about short-term trading, just optimizing a long-term satellite sleeve while the core keeps compounding. Curious to hear your thoughts. Thanks EDIT: maybe I should add AMAZON....?",

My satellites currently include Google GOOG Nvidia NVDA and Broadcom AVGO but together they only make up a small % of my total portfolio . Given that limited size I ’ m wondering Does it make more sense to concentrate on 1–2 names instead of holding all three For a 10–15 year horizon which would you prioritize Google diversified cash machine AI optionality or Nvidia AI leader higher growth but more cyclicalityvaluation risk Where does Broadcom fit for longterm conviction This isn ’ t about shortterm trading just optimizing a longterm satellite sleeve while the core keeps compounding . Curious to hear your thoughts . Thanks EDIT maybe I should add AMAZON ...."

      "selftext": "WILMINGTON, Delaware, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Delaware's Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package from Tesla, which was once valued at $56 billion. Two years ago, a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement, calling it “incredible.” The ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delaware's reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction. This compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new, larger compensation plan in November. The ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018, when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the world's most valuable companies. The 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met. Tesla estimated the plan's potential value at $56 billion in 2018, but given the stock's surge, its value had soared to roughly $120 billion by early November. These options represent about 9% of Tesla's outstanding shares. Musk never exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan, the board was sued by Richard Tornetta, an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock. In 2024, after a five-day trial, Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan. She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded. Musk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Tesla's lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere. A handful of large companies like Dropbox, Roblox, The Trade Desk, and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas. Nevertheless, Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies. Tesla's board warned that Musk the world's richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesn't get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands. In November, shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi network, and humanoid robot sales. Tesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan. The Austin-based company has now incorporated in Texas, enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3% of the company's shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law. Such a stake would be worth approximately $30 billion, and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares.",

      "selftext_processed": "WILMINGTON Delaware Dec 19 Reuters Delawares Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musks 2018 compensation package from Tesla which was once valued at $ 56 billion . Two years ago a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement calling it “ incredible. ” The ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delawares reputation as a businessfriendly jurisdiction . This compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new larger compensation plan in November . The ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018 when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the worlds most valuable companies . The 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met . Tesla estimated the plans potential value at $ 56 billion in 2018 but given the stocks surge its value had soared to roughly $ 120 billion by early November . These options represent about 9 % of Teslas outstanding shares . Musk never_exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan the board was sued by Richard Tornetta an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock . In 2024 after a fiveday trial Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan . She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded . Musk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Teslas lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere . A handful of large companies like Dropbox Roblox The Trade Desk and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas . Nevertheless Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies . Teslas board warned that Musk the worlds richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesnt get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands . In November shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $ 878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles a robotaxi network and humanoid robot sales . Tesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan . The Austinbased company has now incorporated in Texas enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3 % of the companys shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law . Such a stake would be worth approximately $ 30 billion and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares ."

      "selftext": "Everyone is talking about Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia joining the government's \"Genesis Project.\" And yes, it's truly historic to see 24 giants, including Google, Amazon, and OpenAI, signing a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Energy (DOE). But if you only focus on these trillion-dollar giants, you're missing out on opportunities for tenfold returns. The White House has just fast-tracked an AI-driven science platform. We're talking about using AI to solve problems in nuclear fusion, grid modernization, and biotechnology at a speed never before seen by humanity. This isn't just a policy; it's a massive capital injection into AI infrastructure. The Overlooked Winners: While headlines focus on MSFT and NVDA, the real \"generational outperformance\" is hidden in the energy and infrastructure sectors. CRWV just jumped 19% after being added to the index, but there are two other specialized infrastructure stocks that are still trading at a significant discount because the market hasn't yet connected them to this initiative. The Intersection of Nuclear Energy and AI: The Genesis executive order explicitly mentions energy dominance. There's a specific microcap company that provides cooling technology to the Department of Energy's supercomputing labs involved in this mission. Core strategy: The market is currently only seeing this as positive news for large manufacturers, but the supply chain of the Genesis platform is where the real squeeze will occur in the first quarter of 2026. Over the past 48 hours, I cross-referenced the Department of Energy's supplier list with recent patent applications related to the U.S. scientific security platform. I have identified three stock tickers that are highly likely to be the primary beneficiaries of the first wave of federal contracts. WULF best fits the Trump administration's nuclear energy/AI logic, and VRT is the most solid supply chain stock If you're serious about AI/energy trades in 2026, I'd be happy to share this research and exchange ideas on where smart money is flowing before the anticipated surge in the first quarter.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyone is talking about Microsoft Google and Nvidia joining the governments Genesis Project . And yes its truly historic to see 24 giants including Google Amazon and OpenAI signing a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Energy DOE . But if you only focus on these trilliondollar giants youre missing out on opportunities for tenfold returns . The White House has just fasttracked an AIdriven science platform . Were talking about using AI to solve problems in nuclear fusion grid modernization and biotechnology at a speed never_before seen by humanity . This isnt just a policy its a massive capital injection into AI infrastructure . The Overlooked Winners While headlines focus on MSFT and NVDA the real generational outperformance is hidden in the energy and infrastructure sectors . CRWV just jumped 19 % after being added to the index but there are two other specialized infrastructure stocks that are still trading at a significant discount because the market hasnt yet connected them to this initiative . The Intersection of Nuclear Energy and AI The Genesis executive order explicitly mentions energy dominance . Theres a specific microcap company that provides cooling technology to the Department of Energys supercomputing labs involved in this mission . Core strategy The market is currently only seeing this as positive news for large manufacturers but the supply chain of the Genesis platform is where the real squeeze will occur in the first quarter of 2026 . Over the past 48 hours I crossreferenced the Department of Energys supplier list with recent patent applications related to the U.S. scientific security platform . I have identified three stock tickers that are highly likely to be the primary beneficiaries of the first wave of federal contracts . WULF best fits the Trump administrations nuclear energyAI logic and VRT is the most solid supply chain stock If youre serious about AIenergy trades in 2026 Id be happy to share this research and exchange ideas on where smart money is flowing before the anticipated surge in the first quarter ."

      "title": "Preferred Stock Trade for Potential 10-20% Return",
      "selftext": "I came across an interesting trade that I wanted to get thoughts on. It centers around Albemarle's mandatory convertible preferred stock ALB-A. This preferred stock pays a roughly 6% dividend, which is decent, but nothing crazy. Where it gets interesting is knowing that this preferred stock will convert to ALB in Mar. '27. This preferred stock essentially has a mandatory put option built in. This presents an opportunity to sell an ALB call option on a similar timeline. By my math, one could lock in a 10-20% return as long as ALB doesn't drop below $100 from its current $147. Here's how it works: 1. Buy 263 shares of ALB-A today for $16,100 2. Sell an ALB call option for Jan. '27 with a $100 strike price for $6,300 3. Collect $1,192 in ALB-A dividends between now and conversion 4. Reinvest the $6,300 in something safe like SGOV for an additional $250 5. Either close out the positions in Jan. '27 or roll the call option to Mar. '27 after the conversion has happened 6. Conversion happens in Mar. 27 when you'll get between 100 and 120 shares roughly So what are the potential outcomes here? If the share price is above $130, you'd make just under 10%. If the share price falls to $100, you'd make around 20%. The biggest risk is it falls to around $73 or below, at which point you'd start losing money. Ultimately no downside risk until ALB falls more than 50%, and potential returns of 10-20% as long as it doesn't fall more than 30%. Now, could it fall more than 50%? Absolutely. In fact it was around that range as recently as August, but I believe demand for lithium will provide price support. What else haven't I considered?",

      "selftext_processed": "I came across an interesting trade that I wanted to get thoughts on . It centers around Albemarles mandatory convertible preferred stock ALBA . This preferred stock pays a roughly 6 % dividend which is decent but nothing_crazy . Where it gets interesting is knowing that this preferred stock will convert to ALB in Mar . 27 . This preferred stock essentially has a mandatory put option built in . This presents an opportunity to sell an ALB call option on a similar timeline . By my math one could lock in a 1020 % return as long as ALB doesnt drop below $ 100 from its current $ 147 . Heres how it works 1 . Buy 263 shares of ALBA today for $ 16100 2 . Sell an ALB call option for Jan. 27 with a $ 100 strike price for $ 6300 3 . Collect $ 1192 in ALBA dividends between now and conversion 4 . Reinvest the $ 6300 in something safe like SGOV for an additional $ 250 5 . Either close out the positions in Jan. 27 or roll the call option to Mar . 27 after the conversion has happened 6 . Conversion happens in Mar . 27 when youll get between 100 and 120 shares roughly So what are the potential outcomes here If the share price is above $ 130 youd make just under 10 % . If the share price falls to $ 100 youd make around 20 % . The biggest risk is it falls to around $ 73 or below at which point youd start losing money . Ultimately no_downside risk until ALB falls more than 50 % and potential returns of 1020 % as long as it doesnt fall more than 30 % . Now could it fall more than 50 % Absolutely . In fact it was around that range as recently as August but I believe demand for lithium will provide price support . What else havent I considered"

And underperforming in the mag 7 in terms of stock price by quite a bit, which I see as a discount considering everything above\\^ Short term i’m not expecting a boom in price, but in the next one to two years i’m expecting something great from them. Is there anything major i’m missing? or alternative ways you see their spending? I personally can see this stock hitting well over 300 by next December, even though it’s not as flashy as Nvidia or Micron or Palantir Also, what sleeper stocks are you buying into now for the new year?",

Capex of around $ 125 billion this year planning to continue 2026 Major spending in AI infrastructure which unlike others will see immediate use within their own business safe ROI AWS revenue growth of 20 % late 2025 reaching max capacity which 2026 spending will solve Major advertising revenue growth which will increase with their plans for prime . And underperforming in the mag 7 in terms of stock price by quite a bit which I see as a discount considering everything above Short term i ’ m not_expecting a boom in price but in the next one to two years i ’ m expecting something great from them . Is there anything major i ’ m missing or alternative ways you see their spending I personally can see this stock hitting well over 300 by next December even though it ’ s not_as flashy as Nvidia or Micron or Palantir Also what sleeper stocks are you buying into now for the new year"

Is there a good place to read on ways people get around this, if the goal is to stay invested, just diversified? For example, I am aware of [Exchange Funds]( which basically signs a contract to enter some fund by giving your individual stocks for rights to a larger pool of stocks, creating diversification without a sale event. Issue usually is that your stock needs to be part of an exchange fund in order to participate, so options here are limited. The thread about [\"enhanced direct indexing\"]( sparked my interest as well, but seems a little less straight forward since it seems to rely on taking a loan to buy a wide set of stocks via Direct Indexing, and then waiting for some of them to be \"losses\" that you can sell as you slowly unwind your loans and pull out of your concentrated position. Does anyone have other sources? [Fidelity's generic article]( seems to not really know of much beyond what we discussed already.",

Individual stocks feel too difficult and risky for him, so I suggested beginning with an S&P 500 ETF.

Individual stocks feel too difficult and risky for him so I suggested beginning with an SP 500 ETF . My concern is that the SP 500 is already near alltime highs and I ’ m not_sure whether this is the right advice . Am I thinking about this the right way Do you have any recommendations"

      "selftext": "Hi all, I’m looking for some advice and guidance as I’m fairly new to investing outside of ETFs. Up until now, I’ve mainly stuck with ETFs because they feel simpler, more diversified, and easier to understand as a beginner. Lately though, I’ve been thinking about branching out into individual companies, but I’m finding the process a bit overwhelming. There seems to be a huge sea of options when it comes to stocks, across different industries, markets, and levels of risk. With so many companies to choose from, I’m curious how you all narrow things down and decide which ones are worth researching further. Do you start by looking at industries you’re already familiar with, or do you screen based on financial metrics like revenue growth, profitability, or valuation ratios? I’m also interested in learning what your research process looks like before you actually invest. For example, how much weight do you put on a company’s financial statements versus things like management quality, competitive advantages, or long-term growth potential? Are there specific tools, websites, or resources you rely on to help with analysis? Finally, I’d love to know how you manage risk when investing in individual stocks, especially compared to ETFs. Any tips, common mistakes to avoid, or lessons learned from your own experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for any insights you’re willing to share.",

What helped me form better, more independent views was focusing less on predictions and more on process: • Look at base rates and historical regimes. • Track what the market is pricing in, not what you want to happen. • Watch rate-of-change in key data (inflation, liquidity, earnings). • Read smart opposing views. • Update a simple macro dashboard consistently. You don’t need to “predict macro”, you need a framework that helps you notice when the narrative is shifting. What’s the one thing that improved your macro thinking the most?",

If my timing is off I might lose like 3% or so when my stop order hits, but if my timing is correct, I can let those stocks ride and sell a few shares periodically as it goes up.

      "selftext": "I’m a market analyst, and I wanted to share how I currently think about silver not as a trade idea, but as a portfolio component in the current macro environment. From my perspective, silver’s strength this year reflects more than just speculative interest. Several structural factors are converging: 1) Macro backdrop: Falling interest rates and rising fiscal deficits have renewed interest in real assets as stores of value. 2) Investment demand: Both institutional and retail flows into silver ETFs have accelerated, suggesting broader participation rather than isolated speculation. 3) Industrial demand: Silver is increasingly tied to long-term trends such as solar energy, electric vehicles, and data centres areas with secular growth. 4) Supply dynamics: Physical market tightness, particularly in London, has limited available supply, with constraints expected to persist. What makes silver interesting to me is its dual nature part monetary metal, part industrial input. That combination gives it a different risk-return profile than gold or purely cyclical commodities. This isn’t a recommendation to buy or sell just my analytical framework.",

From my perspective silver ’ s strength this year reflects more than just speculative interest . Several structural factors are converging 1 Macro backdrop Falling interest rates and rising fiscal deficits have renewed interest in real assets as stores of value . 2 Investment demand Both institutional and retail flows into silver ETFs have accelerated suggesting broader participation rather than isolated speculation . 3 Industrial demand Silver is increasingly tied to longterm trends such as solar energy electric vehicles and data centres areas with secular growth . 4 Supply dynamics Physical market tightness particularly in London has limited available supply with constraints expected to persist . What makes silver interesting to me is its dual nature part monetary metal part industrial input . That combination gives it a different riskreturn profile than gold or purely cyclical commodities . This isn ’ t a recommendation to buy or sell just my analytical framework ."

      "selftext": "# edit: This post was deleted by reddit's \"bad url\" filter (gay) **TLDR: Dell caught with it's pants down, RAM drought too painful. Dell fuk.** **Who tf is Gom\\_KBull and Why should I listen?** Back in April when SOXL was trading at 8-11 range, I took out a loan and loaded up every single LEAP i could This was [screenshot ]( June and [screenshot ]( July I've sold off all the LEAPs on these in early November, ending in a 3 bagger... although most of us profited big over that 6 month bull-run. Back in November 10, i've put out a [warning ]( shit didnt feel right anymore and the bull run was likely over. This is about all I have as far as credibility (so far). # # The RAM Shortage Preface *Alot of this section is basic knowledge, you can skip if this you are already aware of the RAM shortage.* In case you've been living under a rock, the price of RAM has been going parabolic. This is because AI hyperscalers are offering b00k00 bucks to memory producers for their AI slop generators. So the RAM farmers said \"oh shit, fuck DRAM lets make and sell a metric assload of HBM\" **There are ONLY 3 major memory producers on planet earth: Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron.** **DRAM supply ⬇️, DRAM price ⬆️** But the reality now and going forward into 2026 is: **DRAM supply ⬇️⬇️⬇️, DRAM price ⬆️⬆️⬆️** [Exhibit A]( [Exhibit]( B What does this mean? EVERYTHING in tech is getting squeezed, especially areas that are NOT directly exposed to AI profitability. Everything tech related NEEDS memory, but as long as you're not using HBMs you're going to the second-priority lane. Among the roadkill in this RAM storm, the juiciest looks like Dell. # What is Dell's profitability and exposure looking in this quarter? DELL's revenue stream essentially comes half and half for 2025. One part is ISG (Infrastructure Solutions Group). This side is from providing AI-related solutions, focusing on infrastructure (hello datacenters). The other half is CSG, everytime you see a shiddy DELL laptop, or hardware... this is CSG side. Dell's CSG side of the business is completely fucked (at least for 2026). *Why?* Because Dell is paying 4x for RAM and the cost is only accelerating. Lenovo is hoarding RAM to mitigate this damage ( i tried to link evidence but it got flagged by reddit, but they are front page if you google \"Lenovo Hoarding\"), other PC and smartphone companies (MSFT/AAPL and the like) have long term contracts to LOCK IN prices for their supply. Not to mention MSFT and AAPL are already heavily in the AI game... MUCH more than DELL is. *Does Dell have this security or anything similar?* **NOPE.** Up until 2025, Dell has been known to have short term supply arrangements as its key strength. Now in late 2025 to all of 2026... its their **Achilles' tendon**. The COO (Jeff Clark) of Dell stated >*“We’re in a very unique time. It’s unprecedented. We have not seen costs move at the rate that we’ve seen. And by the way, it’s not unique to DRAM, it’s NAND. It is hard drives, leading edge nodes across the semiconductor network,” he told analysts. “I’d categorize it as demand is way ahead of supply, and as we wade our way through that, we’re going to lean on the things that we’ve always done.”* **This is corporate speak for** >*\"Oh shit oh shit oh shit. This wasn't supposed to happen. Oh god, we're so fuk\"* And Dell has also noted it plans to raise the prices of their products by 10-30% to offset their costs. Here's the problem... ***WHO IS PAYING 20%+ more for Dell products?*** Think about it... would corporates (or even individuals) bite their tongue and pay >20% premium for shiddy Dell laptops and PCs? They have already laid off tens of thousands of employees, they are not in a position to easily fork over cash at a premium for bulk PCs/laptops. There will be customers (both corporate and individual) who are more than willing to just let their existing hardware tough it out for 2-3 years until prices stabilize (hopefully)... and that's IF they don't just look elsewhere. And personally, I believe Dell won't stop at a 30% increase. If these RAM prices continue to rise as they are, Dell will have no choice but to go farther beyond this. But what else CAN they do? They don't have a strategy or countermeasure. This is the last resort when you're supply chain fucks you. As for the ISG side, I admit Dell's operating margins are improving quarter over quarter... but this wont do much to outshine the pain CSG side is feeling. In the big picture, their ISG side has a very very small margin for profitability. Its not very profitable for them right now, but they HAVE TO do it to stay relevant in the AI heavy economic environment we are in. # But what if this is already priced in? It is to a small extent I'll admit, my thesis still holds that Wall street does not fully foresee the horror show that will unfold when DELL releases their numbers in February. **Add onto that, because we don't foresee RAM shortage letting up in 2026-2027, but instead being just as bad or worse for future quarters... They will have to mention that in upcoming guidance.** # How do the Insiders feel? **According to Quiver Quant:** >Dell Technologies insiders have traded $DELL stock on the open market 464 times in the past 6 months. Of those trades, **0 have been purchases** and **464 have been sales**. Here’s a breakdown of [recent trading of $DELL stock]( by insiders over the last 6 months: * [MICHAEL S DELL]( (Chief Executive Officer) has made 0 purchases and 2 sales selling 16,253,968 shares for an estimated **$2,222,753,260**. * IV (GP), L.L.C. SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6,315,957 shares for an estimated **$864,817,529**. * V (GP), L.L.C. SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6,315,957 shares for an estimated **$864,817,529**. * [WILLIAM D GREEN]( has made 0 purchases and 6 sales selling 272,736 shares for an estimated **$39,695,260**. * [ELLEN JAMISON KULLMAN]( sold 79,806 shares for an estimated **$12,255,009** * [WILLIAM F SCANNELL]( (Pres., Glob. Sales & Cust. Ops) sold 91,230 shares for an estimated **$10,803,456** * [EGON DURBAN]( sold 71,000 shares for an estimated **$9,806,520 . . .** # External Considerations * **The fed already booted up QE** * *The fed started reserve management purchases (soft QE?) but its at a much smaller rate than before and only to short dated treasury bills. Beyond providing some health for smallcaps and unfucking the bond yield rates, I don't see this affecting my play for Dell in any meaningful way.* * **AI unwind** * This does not rely on the \"AI Bubble\" or \"AI sentiment souring.\" If AI is dying through the market, this will just be added headwind for Dell. * **What if the RAM Shortage Ends too soon to matter?** * Its already happening, and Dell is ALREADY feeling the pain... moreso than others in its sector (likely HPQ is going through the same but it doesnt seem to be have much meat left on the bones) * RAM production facilities are being built but will take years to start being operational to matter for this play. **Positions:** 20x DELL Mar 20 2026 90 Put 80x DELL APR 17, 2026 75 Put *And I will be accumulating more as we get closer to their earnings in February* *Since Dell's earnings is in February and Micron's earnings will be in March, i might flip my winnings(if any) between the 2 dates.*",

      "selftext_processed": "edit This post was deleted by reddits bad url filter gay TLDR Dell caught with its pants down RAM drought too painful . Dell fuk . Who tf is Gom_KBull and Why should I listen Back in April when SOXL was trading at 811 range I took out a loan and loaded up every single LEAP i could This was screenshot June and screenshot July Ive sold off all the LEAPs on these in early November ending in a 3 bagger ... although most of us profited big over that 6 month bullrun . Back in November 10 ive put out a warning shit didnt feel right anymore and the bull run was likely over . This is about all I have as far as credibility so far . The RAM Shortage Preface Alot of this section is basic knowledge you can skip if this you are already aware of the RAM shortage . In case youve been living under a rock the price of RAM has been going parabolic . This is because AI hyperscalers are offering b00k00 bucks to memory producers for their AI slop generators . So the RAM farmers said oh shit fuck DRAM lets make and sell a metric assload of HBM There are ONLY 3 major memory producers on planet earth Samsung SK Hynix Micron . DRAM supply ⬇️ DRAM price ⬆️ But the reality now and going forward into 2026 is DRAM supply ⬇️⬇️⬇️ DRAM price ⬆️⬆️⬆️ Exhibit A Exhibit B What does this mean EVERYTHING in tech is getting squeezed especially areas that are NOT_directly exposed to AI profitability . Everything tech related NEEDS memory but as long as youre not_using HBMs youre going to the secondpriority lane . Among the roadkill in this RAM storm the juiciest looks like Dell . What is Dells profitability and exposure looking in this quarter DELLs revenue stream essentially comes half and half for 2025 . One part is ISG Infrastructure Solutions Group . This side is from providing AIrelated solutions focusing on infrastructure hello datacenters . The other half is CSG everytime you see a shiddy DELL laptop or hardware ... this is CSG side . Dells CSG side of the business is completely fucked at least for 2026 . Why Because Dell is paying 4x for RAM and the cost is only accelerating . Lenovo is hoarding RAM to mitigate this damage i tried to link evidence but it got flagged by reddit but they are front page if you google Lenovo Hoarding other PC and smartphone companies MSFTAAPL and the like have long term contracts to LOCK IN prices for their supply . Not_to mention MSFT and AAPL are already heavily in the AI game ... MUCH more than DELL is . Does Dell have this security or anything similar NOPE . Up until 2025 Dell has been known to have short term supply arrangements as its key strength . Now in late 2025 to all of 2026 ... its their Achilles tendon . The COO Jeff Clark of Dell stated “ We ’ re in a very unique time . It ’ s unprecedented . We have not_seen costs move at the rate that we ’ ve seen . And by the way it ’ s not_unique to DRAM it ’ s NAND . It is hard drives leading edge nodes across the semiconductor network ” he told analysts . “ I ’ d categorize it as demand is way ahead of supply and as we wade our way through that we ’ re going to lean on the things that we ’ ve always done. ” This is corporate speak for Oh shit oh shit oh shit . This wasnt supposed to happen . Oh god were so fuk And Dell has also noted it plans to raise the prices of their products by 1030 % to offset their costs . Heres the problem ... WHO IS PAYING 20 % more for Dell products Think about it ... would corporates or even individuals bite their tongue and pay 20 % premium for shiddy Dell laptops and PCs They have already laid off tens of thousands of employees they are not_in a position to easily fork over cash at a premium for bulk PCslaptops . There will be customers both corporate and individual who are more than willing to just let their existing hardware tough it out for 23 years until prices stabilize hopefully ... and thats IF they dont just look elsewhere . And personally I believe Dell wont stop at a 30 % increase . If these RAM prices continue to rise as they are Dell will have no_choice but to go farther beyond this . But what else CAN they do They dont have a strategy or countermeasure . This is the last resort when youre supply chain fucks you . As for the ISG side I admit Dells operating margins are improving quarter over quarter ... but this wont do much to outshine the pain CSG side is feeling . In the big picture their ISG side has a very very small margin for profitability . Its not_very profitable for them right now but they HAVE TO do it to stay relevant in the AI heavy economic environment we are in . But what if this is already priced in It is to a small extent Ill admit my thesis still holds that Wall street does not_fully foresee the horror show that will unfold when DELL releases their numbers in February . Add onto that because we dont foresee RAM shortage letting up in 20262027 but instead being just as bad or worse for future quarters ... They will have to mention that in upcoming guidance . How do the Insiders feel According to Quiver Quant Dell Technologies insiders have traded $ DELL stock on the open market 464 times in the past 6 months . Of those trades 0 have been purchases and 464 have been sales . Here ’ s a breakdown of recent trading of $ DELL stock by insiders over the last 6 months MICHAEL S DELL Chief Executive Officer has made 0 purchases and 2 sales selling 16253968 shares for an estimated $ 2222753260 . IV GP L.L.C . SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6315957 shares for an estimated $ 864817529 . V GP L.L.C . SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6315957 shares for an estimated $ 864817529 . WILLIAM D GREEN has made 0 purchases and 6 sales selling 272736 shares for an estimated $ 39695260 . ELLEN JAMISON KULLMAN sold 79806 shares for an estimated $ 12255009 WILLIAM F SCANNELL Pres . Glob . Sales Cust . Ops sold 91230 shares for an estimated $ 10803456 EGON DURBAN sold 71000 shares for an estimated $ 9806520 . . . External Considerations The fed already booted up QE The fed started reserve management purchases soft QE but its at a much smaller rate than before and only to short dated treasury bills . Beyond providing some health for smallcaps and unfucking the bond yield rates I dont see this affecting my play for Dell in any meaningful way . AI unwind This does not_rely on the AI Bubble or AI sentiment souring . If AI is dying through the market this will just be added headwind for Dell . What if the RAM Shortage Ends too soon to matter Its already happening and Dell is ALREADY feeling the pain ... moreso than others in its sector likely HPQ is going through the same but it doesnt seem to be have much meat left on the bones RAM production facilities are being built but will take years to start being operational to matter for this play . Positions 20x DELL Mar 20 2026 90 Put 80x DELL APR 17 2026 75 Put And I will be accumulating more as we get closer to their earnings in February Since Dells earnings is in February and Microns earnings will be in March i might flip my winningsif any between the 2 dates ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ >TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew told employees that the social media company and its parent, ByteDance Ltd., signed binding agreements to create a US joint venture majority-owned by American investors >In an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Chew said he was “pleased to share some great news” and said agreements with Oracle Corp., Silver Lake and MGX have been signed. Chew gave a closing date of Jan. 22, 2026. >“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” Chew said in the memo. Meanwhile, “TikTok global’s U.S. entitieswill manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing,” he wrote. >The memo outlined a deal that matched what the White House announced in September, which was pending approval from China. Chew’s memo does not mention China’s opinion on the transaction. It says 50% of the investors will be new, with Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment company, retaining 15% each; 30.1% will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance. >After more than a year of negotiations, Washington arranged a sale of the US arm of ByteDance’s popular video app to a consortium of investors. If finalized, the deal would remove a persistent issue in Beijing-Washington relations and signal progress in broader talks. But it would also deprive China’s most valuable private company of total control of an American social media phenomenon. >ByteDance’s coveted algorithms are considered central to TikTok’s business. Under the the deal proposed by Washington, ByteDance will license its AI recommendation technology to a newly created US TikTok entity, which will use the existing algorithm to retrain a new system that is secured by Oracle, TikTok’s cloud partner. >Trump’s TikTok Deal With China — What Do We Know?: QuickTake >The White House had dominated disclosures about the proposed arrangement, which was mandated on national security grounds by a law signed last year under the Joe Biden administration. US officials have expressed concern that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, and are worried that Beijing could use the app to collect data about US citizens or push specific narratives to Americans via the app’s recommendation algorithm. >Under the law, the initial deadline for the sell-or-ban rule was this past January, but Trump has extended this deadline multiple times since reentering office, most recently pushing it into January 2026.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew told employees that the social media company and its parent ByteDance Ltd. signed binding agreements to create a US joint venture majorityowned by American investors In an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg Chew said he was “ pleased to share some great news ” and said agreements with Oracle Corp. Silver Lake and MGX have been signed . Chew gave a closing date of Jan. 22 2026 . “ Upon the closing the US joint venture built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security USDS organization will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection algorithm security content moderation and software assurance ” Chew said in the memo . Meanwhile “ TikTok global ’ s U.S. entitieswill manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities including ecommerce advertising and marketing ” he wrote . The memo outlined a deal that matched what the White House announced in September which was pending approval from China . Chew ’ s memo does not_mention China ’ s opinion on the transaction . It says 50 % of the investors will be new with Oracle Silver Lake and MGX an Abu Dhabibased investment company retaining 15 % each 30.1 % will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance and 19.9 % will be retained by ByteDance . After more than a year of negotiations Washington arranged a sale of the US arm of ByteDance ’ s popular video app to a consortium of investors . If finalized the deal would remove a persistent issue in BeijingWashington relations and signal progress in broader talks . But it would also deprive China ’ s most valuable private company of total control of an American social media phenomenon . ByteDance ’ s coveted algorithms are considered central to TikTok ’ s business . Under the the deal proposed by Washington ByteDance will license its AI recommendation technology to a newly created US TikTok entity which will use the existing algorithm to retrain a new system that is secured by Oracle TikTok ’ s cloud partner . Trump ’ s TikTok Deal With China — What Do We Know QuickTake The White House had dominated disclosures about the proposed arrangement which was mandated on national security grounds by a law signed last year under the Joe Biden administration . US officials have expressed concern that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company and are worried that Beijing could use the app to collect data about US citizens or push specific narratives to Americans via the app ’ s recommendation algorithm . Under the law the initial deadline for the sellorban rule was this past January but Trump has extended this deadline multiple times since reentering office most recently pushing it into January 2026 ."

Whats the track record of the management team 6 . What does the barriers to entry for the industry look like 7 . Where is profit made in the industry profitpool value chain analysis 8 . Does the sustainable competitive advantage of the firm derive from local or global markets 9 . Has anyone tried to enter the market and if so how did they do Id love to see incumbents having tried to enter the industry but having failed 10 . If I do a general search on the web what does people say about the firm looking at customers perception this does not_work for all businesses 11 . How exposed is it to macro factors Is it a discretionary nondiscretionary product 12 . Where is the business in its life cycle and how is it positioned to utilize that position 13 . Does it generate ROIC WACC at a persistent level"

      "selftext": "Convenience is one of the few business models that stays powerful in any market. If you remove friction from a routine chore, usage tends to follow. That is the simplest way to understand the EzFill angle under NXXT. Per the EzFill website, the service brings fuel to your vehicle and is built around an app workflow: schedule in minutes, location pins, same day delivery options, and notifications when the job is done. What caught my eye is the stacking. It is not just fuel. The app also shows EZWash, which is basically the same idea applied to vehicle care. More convenience layers can mean more reasons for customers to stay inside one ecosystem rather than shop around each time. EzFill also states 4.8/5 app rating, 1M+ professional deliveries, and 10M+ gallons sold to date on its website. Those are execution claims worth verifying, but they frame this as a working operating business, not a concept pitch. If this is the entry point, the bigger question is whether convenience can drive repeat usage cheaply enough to support durable growth. Do your own research. Not financial advice.",

That is the simplest way to understand the EzFill angle under NXXT . Per the EzFill website the service brings fuel to your vehicle and is built around an app workflow schedule in minutes location pins same day delivery options and notifications when the job is done . What caught my eye is the stacking . It is not_just fuel . The app also shows EZWash which is basically the same idea applied to vehicle care . More convenience layers can mean more reasons for customers to stay inside one ecosystem rather than shop around each time . EzFill also states 4.85 app rating 1M professional deliveries and 10M gallons sold to date on its website . Those are execution claims worth verifying but they frame this as a working operating business not_a concept pitch . If this is the entry point the bigger question is whether convenience can drive repeat usage cheaply enough to support durable growth . Do your own research . Not_financial advice ."

The Consumer Price Index(CPI)rose2.7%annually in November,below estimates at 3.1%. Investors cheered the news as it could encourage the Fed to lower rates. Retailers are seeing consumers trade down to cheaper products. What does it mean for investors? Going into 2026,investors seem to be hoping for a Goldilocks economy,one where the economy isn’t so weak that it leads to a recession,but isn’t strong enough to keep inflation elevated. Ideally,for the stock market,inflation would continue to cool off,which would help the average consumer and could persuade the Fed to cut rates.

That being said I don ’ t pretend I can continue this trend and I have $ 125K or cash waiting to deploy . Should I just go ahead and lump sum it all into VTI and call it a day When I pick stocks I usually do $ 10K buy orders . All my purchases are long term buys . I don ’ t ever sell and don ’ t plan on it until wanting to retire ."

      "selftext": "I’m 18, UK based. Just took control of a £50k+ portfolio I built from savings and side hustles (flipping golf clubs, designer stuff, bit of luck). It’s been with the same firm my parents use. They’re about wealth preservation, not growth. Best year I got \\~16% while the S&P 500 did \\~25%. Fees are 1% + 0.5% platform. I don’t even meet their usual client threshold but they still want to keep me, which feels off. My aim is long term: save hard, compound, hit my financial goal at 45. With steady contributions and \\~7.5% returns after fees, it’s doable. Thinking of pulling it all out and going DIY passive. Options: * 80% S&P 500 / 20% Nasdaq (higher growth, higher risk) * 70% S&P 500 / 30% global index + a few stocks (more diversified, less tech heavy) I know people talk about an AI bubble but at my age I think I can ride it out. So: * Is all‑in S&P realistic for a UK investor long term? * Is Nasdaq worth the risk or better to diversify? * Any regrets from leaving wealth managers and going DIY index funds? Not after hype, just grounded experiences. Cheers.",

It ’ s been with the same firm my parents use . They ’ re about wealth preservation not_growth . Best year I got 16 % while the SP 500 did 25 % . Fees are 1 % 0.5 % platform . I don ’ t even meet their usual client threshold but they still want to keep me which feels off . My aim is long term save hard compound hit my financial goal at 45 . With steady contributions and 7.5 % returns after fees it ’ s doable . Thinking of pulling it all out and going DIY passive . Options 80 % SP 500 20 % Nasdaq higher growth higher risk 70 % SP 500 30 % global index a few stocks more diversified less tech heavy I know people talk about an AI bubble but at my age I think I can ride it out . So Is all‑in SP realistic for a UK investor long term Is Nasdaq worth the risk or better to diversify Any regrets from leaving wealth managers and going DIY index funds Not_after hype just grounded experiences .

Revenue came in at 13.64 billion dollars up 57 percent year over year and 21 percent quarter over quarter well above the 12.92 billion consensus. Profitability improved sharply with GAAP gross margin rising to 56 percent up 17.6 points year over year and 11.3 points sequentially beating the 51 percent estimate. GAAP net income reached 5.24 billion dollars up 180 percent year over year and 64 percent quarter over quarter again well ahead of expectations. The core driver was explosive AI driven memory demand. HBM led the upside with capacity already sold out and management significantly raising its outlook for the future HBM market showing demand is far stronger than previously expected. At the same time traditional DRAM and NAND also benefited from AI spillover demand and tight supply leading to both volume and price increases and pushing overall margins to new highs. An aggressive next quarter guide further reinforced confidence that the memory industry is entering a new upcycle.

      "title": "The True Danger of Investing in Bitcoin",
      "selftext": "You’ve all heard about the usual dangers of holding Bitcoin: losing your private keys, an exchange getting hacked, a 51% attack, a hard drive failure. Some even worry about extreme scenarios, like a massive solar storm wiping out digital infrastructure. But the real danger of holding Bitcoin is something far more fundamental. It isn’t technical, accidental, or catastrophic. It lies in the fact that what you are holding is a mirage, a ghost, a collective illusion. When you buy Bitcoin, you receive nothing that can be psychically used, no mass or volume. Your receive a number: a balance. And if that balance truly represents something valuable, something worth the enormous amount of electricity required to maintain the system, then it must allow you to extract something real. After all, you currently have to pay around $90,000 for that balance to increase by one. Yet the reality is that you can extract literally nothing from it. What is being sold is a mirage. Why? When you examine any traditional financial balance, you find that it represents someone else’s liability. For a balance to be legitimate, there must be an individual or institution that has taken on a liability because it is precisely from this liability that balance holders extract value. When a liability is fulfilled, the holder receives real economic benefits. Let’s look at some concrete examples. The balance in a stock broker’s account represents the company’s liability. When the company distributes profits, conducts a share buyback, or liquidates its operations, it is obligated to make payments to the holders of that balance. The balance in a commodity broker’s account represents the liability of the broker or intermediary institution toward the balance holder. That liability involves enabling delivery of the contracted commodity or executing a cash payment equivalent to its value, depending on the trading conditions and the type of contract. The balance in a bank account represents the bank’s liability toward the balance holder and, at the same time, the liability of the bank’s debtor toward the bank. This balance arises when a bank (commercial or central) approves a loan to an individual, company, or state. Debtors use this balance in the market to obtain labor, services, and goods. Because they are obligated to repay the loan, they must ultimately return goods, labor, and services to the balance holders, while the state allows taxes to be paid using this balance. If the loan is not repaid, the bank seizes the debtor’s real estate, equipment, or vehicles and sells them at auction to balance holders. Thus, through the fulfillment of underlying liability, bank balance holders realize tangible benefits: goods, labor, services, tax relief, and physical assets. Bitcoin stands in stark contrast. In Bitcoin, there is no liability at all. There is no issuer, no debtor, and no institution that owes anything to the holder. The system consists of a protocol that assigns computational tasks, consumes energy, and, if those tasks are completed, records a number under an identifier in a distributed database. Users control cryptographic keys that allow them to move numbers between identifiers. And that is literally it. No claim is created. No liability is recorded. No future delivery of goods, services, or assets is required. The system appears as a financial balance, but it is merely a mechanism for reassigning numbers between identifiers. No holder can extract any economic benefit from it. All those sky-high prices, all the hype, and all the discussion are built on an illusion. All promotion of Bitcoin as an “inflation hedge,” “scarce,” or “valuable” is a category error. Inflation arises from excessive or diluted liabilities in a banking system. Since Bitcoin has no underlying liability, it cannot hedge against excessive or diluted liabilities. Scarcity refers to a limited amount of an existing resource (mass, volume, or liability), not a rule about the maximum sum of numbers in a system. Value results from evaluating that resource. Spending electricity or paying to have a number increased is not evaluation. There is nothing to evaluate in a number. And with nothing to evaluate, there cannot be value. All promotion of Bitcoin serves a single purpose: to attract the public to give up physical assets or real financial balances that deliver tangible value, in exchange for \"ghost\" balances that deliver nothing. It is obvious why this is dangerous. Illusions, mirages, and hype, by their very nature, cannot last forever. Sooner or later, reality asserts itself. A system built on collective belief rather than liabilities, claims, or tangible value is destined to fail. When that collapse comes, all the resources poured into maintaining it, the electricity, the infrastructure, the opportunity cost of real assets surrendered, become sunk costs with no return. Holders who traded real financial claims will find there is simply nothing to extract. The danger is not theoretical; it is baked into the Bitcoin itself.",

      "selftext_processed": "You ’ ve all heard about the usual dangers of holding Bitcoin losing your private keys an exchange getting hacked a 51 % attack a hard drive failure . Some even worry about extreme scenarios like a massive solar storm wiping out digital infrastructure . But the real danger of holding Bitcoin is something far more fundamental . It isn ’ t technical accidental or catastrophic . It lies in the fact that what you are holding is a mirage a ghost a collective illusion . When you buy Bitcoin you receive nothing_that can be psychically used no_mass or volume . Your receive a number a balance . And if that balance truly represents something valuable something worth the enormous amount of electricity required to maintain the system then it must allow you to extract something real . After all you currently have to pay around $ 90000 for that balance to increase by one . Yet the reality is that you can extract literally nothing_from it . What is being sold is a mirage . Why When you examine any traditional financial balance you find that it represents someone else ’ s liability . For a balance to be legitimate there must be an individual or institution that has taken on a liability because it is precisely from this liability that balance holders extract value . When a liability is fulfilled the holder receives real economic benefits . Let ’ s look at some concrete examples . The balance in a stock broker ’ s account represents the company ’ s liability . When the company distributes profits conducts a share buyback or liquidates its operations it is obligated to make payments to the holders of that balance . The balance in a commodity broker ’ s account represents the liability of the broker or intermediary institution toward the balance holder . That liability involves enabling delivery of the contracted commodity or executing a cash payment equivalent to its value depending on the trading conditions and the type of contract . The balance in a bank account represents the bank ’ s liability toward the balance holder and at the same time the liability of the bank ’ s debtor toward the bank . This balance arises when a bank commercial or central approves a loan to an individual company or state . Debtors use this balance in the market to obtain labor services and goods . Because they are obligated to repay the loan they must ultimately return goods labor and services to the balance holders while the state allows taxes to be paid using this balance . If the loan is not_repaid the bank seizes the debtor ’ s real estate equipment or vehicles and sells them at auction to balance holders . Thus through the fulfillment of underlying liability bank balance holders realize tangible benefits goods labor services tax relief and physical assets . Bitcoin stands in stark contrast . In Bitcoin there is no_liability at all . There is no_issuer no_debtor and no_institution that owes anything to the holder . The system consists of a protocol that assigns computational tasks consumes energy and if those tasks are completed records a number under an identifier in a distributed database . Users control cryptographic keys that allow them to move numbers between identifiers . And that is literally it . No_claim is created . No_liability is recorded . No_future delivery of goods services or assets is required . The system appears as a financial balance but it is merely a mechanism for reassigning numbers between identifiers . No_holder can extract any economic benefit from it . All those skyhigh prices all the hype and all the discussion are built on an illusion . All promotion of Bitcoin as an “ inflation hedge ” “ scarce ” or “ valuable ” is a category error . Inflation arises from excessive or diluted liabilities in a banking system . Since Bitcoin has no_underlying liability it can not hedge against excessive or diluted liabilities . Scarcity refers to a limited amount of an existing resource mass volume or liability not_a rule about the maximum sum of numbers in a system . Value results from evaluating that resource . Spending electricity or paying to have a number increased is not_evaluation . There is nothing_to evaluate in a number . And with nothing_to evaluate there can not be value . All promotion of Bitcoin serves a single purpose to attract the public to give up physical assets or real financial balances that deliver tangible value in exchange for ghost balances that deliver nothing_It is obvious why this is dangerous . Illusions mirages and hype by their very nature can not last forever . Sooner or later reality asserts itself . A system built on collective belief rather than liabilities claims or tangible value is destined to fail . When that collapse comes all the resources poured into maintaining it the electricity the infrastructure the opportunity cost of real assets surrendered become sunk costs with no_return . Holders who traded real financial claims will find there is simply nothing_to extract . The danger is not_theoretical it is baked into the Bitcoin itself ."

      "title": "Not overreacting to the NVDA insider sale",
      "selftext": "Nvidia director Harvey Jones sold about 250,000 shares around $177 for roughly $44M. These were shares he’s held for decades, and he still controls over 7M shares through a trust, so I read this as long term trimming more than a confidence signal turning negative. (News source if you’re interested: Nvidia Executives Sell Over $41 Million in Stock)For me, the headline only matters if it lines up with the chart. NVDA is in a pretty defined zone and the $177 to $180 area is the near term pivot. That’s roughly where the sale happened, and it has also been a tough area for the stock to push through lately. If NVDA can reclaim $180 and stay above it for a few closes, it’s basically the market saying it does not care about the insider headline.On the downside, I’m watching $169 to $171 as first support. If that breaks cleanly, the next likely stop is the mid $160s, around $165 to $160. Below that, you’re probably looking at the low $150s, and that usually needs a broader market wobble or a real shift in the AI narrative. This is also why I’m not overreacting to the insider sale by itself. Big, long held positions get trimmed all the time. Without a real break in price or a clear change in demand signals, it’s not enough for me to call a top.",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in Lululemon Athletica Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter, as the struggling retailer faces a strategic overhaul amid its chief executive officer’s exit. >Elliott has been working for months with retail executive Jane Nielsen — a former chief financial officer and chief operating officer at Ralph Lauren — on Lululemon, said the person, who asked to remain unnamed as the matter is private. >The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the news, said Nielsen is viewed by the activist as a potential CEO candidate. The company is searching for a replacement for current CEO Calvin McDonald, who will step down from the role at the end of January. >A representative for Elliott declined to comment. Lululemon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. >Shares of Lululemon rose more than 5% in early trading before the market opens in New York. The stock has rallied, rising about 11%, since Friday when the athletic-wear maker boosted its full-year outlook and announced that McDonald would depart. >The Vancouver-based company’s growth has slowed in recent quarters and that trend is expected to continue, according to analyst estimates. Sales growth is near the lowest level since the company went public in 2007 as Lululemon faces fierce competition from upstarts including Alo Yoga and Vuori, as well as knockoffs from lower-priced retailers. >Lululemon’s shares have fallen 46% this year, giving the company a market value of $24 billion.",

Elliott has been working for months with retail executive Jane Nielsen — a former chief financial officer and chief operating officer at Ralph Lauren — on Lululemon said the person who asked to remain unnamed as the matter is private . The Wall Street Journal which first reported on the news said Nielsen is viewed by the activist as a potential CEO candidate . The company is searching for a replacement for current CEO Calvin McDonald who will step down from the role at the end of January . A representative for Elliott declined to comment . Lululemon didn ’ t immediately respond to a request for comment . Shares of Lululemon rose more than 5 % in early trading before the market opens in New York . The stock has rallied rising about 11 % since Friday when the athleticwear maker boosted its fullyear outlook and announced that McDonald would depart . The Vancouverbased company ’ s growth has slowed in recent quarters and that trend is expected to continue according to analyst estimates . Sales growth is near the lowest level since the company went public in 2007 as Lululemon faces fierce competition from upstarts including Alo Yoga and Vuori as well as knockoffs from lowerpriced retailers . Lululemon ’ s shares have fallen 46 % this year giving the company a market value of $ 24 billion ."

      "title": "POET: The Photonic Solution to the SSD & RAM Shortage",
      "selftext": "We're all fully aware of what's going on with the supply chain shortages on RAM and SSD. [Kingston]( sent out a warning stating that NAND costs are up 246% since early 2025 and says RAM/SSD prices are likely to keep rising through 2026 rather than come back down. [SK Hynix]( is telling investors that the global memory shortage could drag on until 2028, even as they and Samsung print multi year high profits on AI memory. NAND suppliers are already reporting that their 2026 enterprise SSD allocations are basically sold out, with double-digit price hikes locked in. On top of this, hyperscalers are only getting about [70% of the server DRAM they order]( even after accepting contract price increases of up to 50% in a single quarter. Then you got Sam Altman doing his best impression of Dr. Evil prebooking [40% of the world's DRAM]( wafers with money that has yet to be seen. I say all this to say, HBM/DRAM/flash has become the new oil for AI, and everyone is fighting over the same barrels. What I have come to notice is that real choke point isn’t just how much memory you can buy, it’s how efficiently you can use the memory you already have, and how fast you can shove bits between GPUs, DRAM pools, and SSDs without the copper plumbing melting down and draining power grids of every last drop of electricity they can possibly produce. In light of the RAM/SSD shortage, this has become a conversation about **finding solutions that can maximize the compute potential of the currently existing infrastructure to meet current AI demands** This is where POET’s photonic engines come in: they don’t manufacture a single RAM chip or SSD, but they act like adding extra lanes to the AI data highway, letting data centers squeeze more training and inference out of every scarce byte of HBM/DRAM/flash. **So POET has two main products:** [The Optical Interposer]( \\- think of this as an “optical motherboard tile/chiplet.” [Starlight]( \\- an external laser farm that feeds those tiles with light. Today’s optics usually look like this: * You’ve got a discrete transceiver module in a metal “gold box.” * Inside that box: lasers, modulators, drivers, receivers, lenses, fiber alignment, etc. * Every module is handheld, robot aligned, and tuned. Slow, expensive, power-hungry. POET’s interposer basically says fuck the gold box * They take silicon and III-V lasers and build everything into a flat wafer-scale platform. * Instead of doing micron-level alignment one module at a time, they pattern the waveguides in lithography and drop the chips on with cheap pick-and-place tools. * Fibers line up passively, so there's really no heavy and expensive manufacturing process involved * The parts on the interposer are configureable, so this gives hyperscalers flexibility to choose which components and tier of components they would like on the interposer. think of the interposer like a complex lego block and you can piece together whichever legos you want to it. To visualize, the interposer sits between the hot compute chips (GPUs/ASICs/NPUs) and the outside world (network, memory pools, storage) and replaces a bunch of copper with light paths. **Starlight is more of a accessory to the interposer.** * Instead of putting hot, fragile lasers on the GPU/package, they park the lasers off to the side in a dedicated module. * That Starlight box pumps clean laser light over fiber into a bunch of POET interposer engines sitting near the compute. **The benefits are:** * Keeps lasers away from 700W space heaters (GB200, H100, etc.). * One laser farm can feed many engines instead of every module lugging its own lasers. * Better reliability, easier maintenance, and lower $/bit because you share the light source across multiple links. **So together these two components work like this:** Starlight = shared light source Interposer = cheap, configurable, mass-produced optical engine tile that is easily scalable. This is probably the biggest sell for me on this product, as this gives hyperscalers more flexibility to customize the interposer **So how is different from the other companies that offer a photonics solution?** Most of the big incumbents (Broadcom, Coherent, Lumentum, etc.) are still: * Shipping discrete pluggable modules (400G/800G, etc.). * Using a lot of active alignment and labor-intensive packaging. * Typically putting lasers inside every module, which: * Wastes power * Adds heat right where you don’t want it * Doesn’t scale nicely to 1.6T / 3.2T and giant AI fabrics. **POET’s edge vs “generic” silicon photonics:** * Wafer-scale, passive alignment which lowers capex, lowers assembly cost, and is easier to ramp volume. * Allows hybrid integration: can mix and match best-of-breed lasers with silicon in one platform. * Remote lasers (Starlight) which results in fewer total lasers and less heat on the package. And if you're wondering if any of this technology has even been validated, look no further than Marvell Technologies, [who purchased one of POET's largest customers]( Celestial AI, for up to $5+ billion. Marvell's main reason for acquiring Celestial AI was for its Photonic Fabric, an optical interconnect architecture that is built atop POET's Optical Interposer and uses POET’s Starlight as a remote laser source. In other words, a serious, blue-chip semi company and at least one hyperscaler ([AWS](#google_vignette)) have already done the homework on this architecture and decided it’s real enough to bet billions and multi-year roadmaps on. You don’t build a next-gen AI fabric around external lasers and wafer-scale photonics if you’re not confident the vendors in that stack can actually meet the eye diagrams, BER targets, thermal budgets, and manufacturing yields you need at hyperscale. The Marvell/Celestial deal is basically the the big dawgs in the room saying: “Yes, this class of photonic solution is how we’re going to attack the I/O wall.” Also, Celestial AI's CEO, [David Lazovsky]( was the Executive Chairman at POET How does any of this actually help with the RAM/SSD shortage? POET obviously doesn’t fab a single DRAM chip or SSD, so the way they solve the shortage is indirect, but very real: they change the economics of how much useful work you can squeeze out of every byte of memory and every GPU you already own. Right now, hyperscalers are in a ridiculous situation. They’re paying insane prices for HBM, DRAM, and enterprise SSDs, but a lot of that capacity is effectively stranded. You have GPUs sitting on islands of local HBM, servers with their own DRAM, storage boxes full of flash, and the copper between them can’t move data fast enough. So to keep latency acceptable, the big guys end up replicating the same data all over the place, sharding models, caching datasets on every node, and overbuilding memory just so the network doesn’t become a brick wall. That’s fine when RAM is cheap. It’s a killer when HBM/DRAM/flash prices are up 200% over the last month. On the power side, POET’s own FAQ for their 800G/1.6T engines spells out that by using directly modulated lasers and getting rid of extra modulators, wirebonds, and gearbox/DSP overhead, they can cut about **6–8 watts of power per module** versus conventional approaches at these speeds. Six to eight watts doesn’t sound like much until you remember you’re not deploying one module, you’re deploying thousands. At 10,000 modules across a big AI cluster, that’s **60–80 kW of power and cooling you’re not wasting just on the optics layer.** That “freed” power budget can either lower your overall TCO or be reallocated to more GPUs and more memory in the same rack/power envelope. Then there’s cost. In their Starlight FAQ, POET flat-out says that for Celestial AI, the Starlight external light source is expected to be **up to 75% cheaper than comparable light sources on the market**, thanks to the Optical Interposer’s lower bill of materials and wafer level assembly. Cheap optics are what allow hyperscalers to overspec bandwidth relative to memory, which is exactly what you want when memory itself is the constrained resource. There’s also a quiet supply angle baked in: their 1.6T transmitter is the first to efficiently use an electroabsorption modulated laser array in this way, and POET explicitly calls out that it gives a “dramatic capacity increase” for Indium Phosphide electroabsorption modulated lasers at a time when the industry is facing shortages of those lasers. In other words, they’re not just stretching HBM/DRAM/SSD; they’re also stretching scarce laser capacity on the photonics side by packing more usable throughput per laser device. **Put that together in plain English: a single POET-based engine gives you terabit-class bandwidth in a tiny footprint, saves you several watts per port at 800G/1.6T, cuts your light source cost by as much as three-quarters, and increases the amount of traffic you can push per scarce laser. That’s what makes it a lever against the memory/SSD shortages. this results in:** * **GPUs spend more time actually computing instead of waiting on I/O.** * **You need fewer duplicate copies of data sprayed across the cluster just to hide latency.** * **You can justify architecting shared memory pools and far-flash tiers because the fabric is fast and efficient enough to make them usable.** So in a world where HBM/DRAM/SSD are the new oil and the barrels are sold out years in advance, POET’s pitch is basically: “Let us give you 1.6 Tbps-class optical engines that burn 6–8 W less per port and slash light-source cost by up to 75%, so you can stop wasting the obscenely expensive memory you already have.” This ultimately maximizes the compute potential of the present AI infrastructure to meet current AI demands and lessens the reliance on more compute power and SSD/RAM. **TL;DR** AI has turned HBM/DRAM/flash into the new oil. Prices are ripping, supply is pre-sold years out, and hyperscalers still can’t get all the memory they want – but the real choke point now is how efficiently they can use the insanely expensive RAM/SSD they already have and how fast they can move data between GPUs, DRAM pools, and storage. POET attacks that bottleneck: its Optical Interposer replaces bulky “gold box” optics with a wafer-scale, Lego-style optical tile, and its Starlight module moves the lasers off the hot GPU package into a shared external laser farm, making high-bandwidth links cheaper, cooler, and easier to scale. That lets photonic fabrics deliver terabit-class bandwidth, cut power and light-source cost, and reduce stranded/duplicated data, so you get more training and inference per GPU and per GB of HBM/DRAM/SSD instead of just brute-forcing with more hardware. In a world where memory is scarce and pre-booked, POET doesn’t make bytes – it makes the plumbing that squeezes more value out of every byte, and the Marvell–Celestial AI deal is the big-cap validation that this external-laser, photonic-fabric path is actually where hyperscalers are headed. **Position:** Edit: Interesting Statement: “Dave Brown, Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services at AWS, commented on Marvell’s acquisition of Celestial AI in their official announcement, stating: “At AWS, we aim to be at the forefront of major technology inflections, and we believe optical interconnects will play an important role in the future of AI infrastructure. Building a scalable, high-performance, and power-efficient cloud starts with an approach built upon differentiated technologies. Celestial AI has made impressive progress, and we expect their combination with a large-scale semiconductor company like Marvell will help further accelerate optical scale-up innovation for next-generation AI deployments.””",

      "selftext_processed": "Were all fully aware of whats going on with the supply chain shortages on RAM and SSD . Kingston sent out a warning stating that NAND costs are up 246 % since early 2025 and says RAMSSD prices are likely to keep rising through 2026 rather than come back down . SK Hynix is telling investors that the global memory shortage could drag on until 2028 even as they and Samsung print multi year high profits on AI memory . NAND suppliers are already reporting that their 2026 enterprise SSD allocations are basically sold out with doubledigit price hikes locked in . On top of this hyperscalers are only getting about 70 % of the server DRAM they order even after accepting contract price increases of up to 50 % in a single quarter . Then you got Sam Altman doing his best impression of Dr . Evil prebooking 40 % of the worlds DRAM wafers with money that has yet to be seen . I say all this to say HBMDRAMflash has become the new oil for AI and everyone is fighting over the same barrels . What I have come to notice is that real choke point isn ’ t just how much memory you can buy it ’ s how efficiently you can use the memory you already have and how fast you can shove bits between GPUs DRAM pools and SSDs without the copper plumbing melting down and draining power grids of every last drop of electricity they can possibly produce . In light of the RAMSSD shortage this has become a conversation about finding solutions that can maximize the compute potential of the currently existing infrastructure to meet current AI demands This is where POET ’ s photonic engines come in they don ’ t manufacture a single RAM chip or SSD but they act like adding extra lanes to the AI data highway letting data centers squeeze more training and inference out of every scarce byte of HBMDRAMflash . So POET has two main products The Optical Interposer think of this as an “ optical motherboard tilechiplet. ” Starlight an external laser farm that feeds those tiles with light . Today ’ s optics usually look like this You ’ ve got a discrete transceiver module in a metal “ gold box. ” Inside that box lasers modulators drivers receivers lenses fiber alignment etc . Every module is handheld robot aligned and tuned . Slow expensive powerhungry . POET ’ s interposer basically says fuck the gold box They take silicon and IIIV lasers and build everything into a flat waferscale platform . Instead of doing micronlevel alignment one module at a time they pattern the waveguides in lithography and drop the chips on with cheap pickandplace tools . Fibers line up passively so theres really no_heavy and expensive manufacturing process involved The parts on the interposer are configureable so this gives hyperscalers flexibility to choose which components and tier of components they would like on the interposer . think of the interposer like a complex lego block and you can piece together whichever legos you want to it . To visualize the interposer sits between the hot compute chips GPUsASICsNPUs and the outside world network memory pools storage and replaces a bunch of copper with light paths . Starlight is more of a accessory to the interposer . Instead of putting hot fragile lasers on the GPUpackage they park the lasers off to the side in a dedicated module . That Starlight box pumps clean laser light over fiber into a bunch of POET interposer engines sitting near the compute . The benefits are Keeps lasers away from 700W space heaters GB200 H100 etc .. One laser farm can feed many engines instead of every module lugging its own lasers . Better reliability easier maintenance and lower $ bit because you share the light source across multiple links . So together these two components work like this Starlight shared light source Interposer cheap configurable massproduced optical engine tile that is easily scalable . This is probably the biggest sell for me on this product as this gives hyperscalers more flexibility to customize the interposer So how is different from the other companies that offer a photonics solution Most of the big incumbents Broadcom Coherent Lumentum etc . are still Shipping discrete pluggable modules 400G800G etc .. Using a lot of active alignment and laborintensive packaging . Typically putting lasers inside every module which Wastes power Adds heat right where you don ’ t want it Doesn ’ t scale nicely to 1.6T 3.2T and giant AI fabrics . POET ’ s edge vs “ generic ” silicon photonics Waferscale passive alignment which lowers capex lowers assembly cost and is easier to ramp volume . Allows hybrid integration can mix and match bestofbreed lasers with silicon in one platform . Remote lasers Starlight which results in fewer total lasers and less heat on the package . And if youre wondering if any of this technology has even been validated look no_further than Marvell Technologies who purchased one of POETs largest customers Celestial AI for up to $ 5 billion . Marvells main reason for acquiring Celestial AI was for its Photonic Fabric an optical interconnect architecture that is built atop POETs Optical Interposer and uses POET ’ s Starlight as a remote laser source . In other words a serious bluechip semi company and at least one hyperscaler AWSgoogle_vignette have already done the homework on this architecture and decided it ’ s real enough to bet billions and multiyear roadmaps on . You don ’ t build a nextgen AI fabric around external lasers and waferscale photonics if you ’ re not_confident the vendors in that stack can actually meet the eye diagrams BER targets thermal budgets and manufacturing yields you need at hyperscale . The MarvellCelestial deal is basically the the big dawgs in the room saying “ Yes this class of photonic solution is how we ’ re going to attack the IO wall. ” Also Celestial AIs CEO David Lazovsky was the Executive Chairman at POET How does any of this actually help with the RAMSSD shortage POET obviously doesn ’ t fab a single DRAM chip or SSD so the way they solve the shortage is indirect but very real they change the economics of how much useful work you can squeeze out of every byte of memory and every GPU you already own . Right now hyperscalers are in a ridiculous situation . They ’ re paying insane prices for HBM DRAM and enterprise SSDs but a lot of that capacity is effectively stranded . You have GPUs sitting on islands of local HBM servers with their own DRAM storage boxes full of flash and the copper between them can ’ t move data fast enough . So to keep latency acceptable the big guys end up replicating the same data all over the place sharding models caching datasets on every node and overbuilding memory just so the network doesn ’ t become a brick wall . That ’ s fine when RAM is cheap . It ’ s a killer when HBMDRAMflash prices are up 200 % over the last month . On the power side POET ’ s own FAQ for their 800G1.6T engines spells out that by using directly modulated lasers and getting rid of extra modulators wirebonds and gearboxDSP overhead they can cut about 6–8 watts of power per module versus conventional approaches at these speeds . Six to eight watts doesn ’ t sound like much until you remember you ’ re not_deploying one module you ’ re deploying thousands . At 10000 modules across a big AI cluster that ’ s 60–80 kW of power and cooling you ’ re not_wasting just on the optics layer . That “ freed ” power budget can either lower your overall TCO or be reallocated to more GPUs and more memory in the same rackpower envelope . Then there ’ s cost . In their Starlight FAQ POET flatout says that for Celestial AI the Starlight external light source is expected to be up to 75 % cheaper than comparable light sources on the market thanks to the Optical Interposer ’ s lower bill of materials and wafer level assembly . Cheap optics are what allow hyperscalers to overspec bandwidth relative to memory which is exactly what you want when memory itself is the constrained resource . There ’ s also a quiet supply angle baked in their 1.6T transmitter is the first to efficiently use an electroabsorption modulated laser array in this way and POET explicitly calls out that it gives a “ dramatic capacity increase ” for Indium Phosphide electroabsorption modulated lasers at a time when the industry is facing shortages of those lasers . In other words they ’ re not_just stretching HBMDRAMSSD they ’ re also stretching scarce laser capacity on the photonics side by packing more usable throughput per laser device . Put that together in plain English a single POETbased engine gives you terabitclass bandwidth in a tiny footprint saves you several watts per port at 800G1.6T cuts your light source cost by as much as threequarters and increases the amount of traffic you can push per scarce laser . That ’ s what makes it a lever against the memorySSD shortages . this results in GPUs spend more time actually computing instead of waiting on IO . You need fewer duplicate copies of data sprayed across the cluster just to hide latency . You can justify architecting shared memory pools and farflash tiers because the fabric is fast and efficient enough to make them usable . So in a world where HBMDRAMSSD are the new oil and the barrels are sold out years in advance POET ’ s pitch is basically “ Let us give you 1.6 Tbpsclass optical engines that burn 6–8 W less per port and slash lightsource cost by up to 75 % so you can stop wasting the obscenely expensive memory you already have. ” This ultimately maximizes the compute potential of the present AI infrastructure to meet current AI demands and lessens the reliance on more compute power and SSDRAM . TLDR AI has turned HBMDRAMflash into the new oil . Prices are ripping supply is presold years out and hyperscalers still can ’ t get all the memory they want – but the real choke point now is how efficiently they can use the insanely expensive RAMSSD they already have and how fast they can move data between GPUs DRAM pools and storage . POET attacks that bottleneck its Optical Interposer replaces bulky “ gold box ” optics with a waferscale Legostyle optical tile and its Starlight module moves the lasers off the hot GPU package into a shared external laser farm making highbandwidth links cheaper cooler and easier to scale . That lets photonic fabrics deliver terabitclass bandwidth cut power and lightsource cost and reduce strandedduplicated data so you get more training and inference per GPU and per GB of HBMDRAMSSD instead of just bruteforcing with more hardware . In a world where memory is scarce and prebooked POET doesn ’ t make bytes – it makes the plumbing that squeezes more value out of every byte and the Marvell–Celestial AI deal is the bigcap validation that this externallaser photonicfabric path is actually where hyperscalers are headed . Position Edit Interesting Statement “ Dave Brown Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services at AWS commented on Marvell ’ s acquisition of Celestial AI in their official announcement stating “ At AWS we aim to be at the forefront of major technology inflections and we believe optical interconnects will play an important role in the future of AI infrastructure . Building a scalable highperformance and powerefficient cloud starts with an approach built upon differentiated technologies . Celestial AI has made impressive progress and we expect their combination with a largescale semiconductor company like Marvell will help further accelerate optical scaleup innovation for nextgeneration AI deployments . ” ”"

      "selftext": "The unemployment print this week was higher than expected and is signaling an upward trend in unemployment. Historically, the Sahm indicator has been used as a confirmation tool for \"recession\" (I use quotes because I feel the term has become more and more ambiguous in recent years) and is a measure of how unemployment is trending. For those who are unfamiliar with the Sahm indicator--It looks at the unemployment moving average. Fundamentally, it takes a look at the lowest 3-month moving average over a 12-month period (currently about \\~4.2%) and compares it to the most recent 3-month moving average. Essentially, if the current 3-month moving average is .50% (50 bps) higher than the 3-month moving average low, it produces a confirmation signal of \"recession\" with no historical false positives. The current moving average of unemployment is \\~4.43% which puts us north of 20 bps toward the signal. If the January 9th print is anything higher than 4.7%, there will be real concerns about the state of the economy (will put unemployment moving average at about \\~40 bps above the moving average low). As of today's (12/17) price action, it looks like the market is pricing in the possibility of an accelerating unemployment trend that could continue in January's print. The Fed recently cut rates which may help reduce firing rates as cost saving measures, but January's unemployment print will be critical in understanding where the economy is at and likely where the stock market will go next. TL;DR--If unemployment print on 1/9/26 >4.7%, risk off. If less than, likely a neutral to risk on shift.",

      "selftext": "Been investing for years, but I went all in on options (mostly TSLA and CVNA puts) earlier this year. Big mistake. Wiped out almost my entire account. Down from $120k to $5k in a matter of weeks. Turns out I have a bit of a gambling problem, so options aren’t a good idea for me. Went back to basics: aka penny stocks. I’ve got a lot of experience (good and bad) with small caps, and decided to only focus on buying and holing long after doing extensive DD. Only issue is I didn’t have cash to play with. Fortunately I had excellent credit on account of always auto paying credit cards and never taking out loans. So I called up all the financial institutions I had banked with and asked them for the biggest loans they would give me. This turned out to only be about $30k, which wasn’t enough, so I set my credit cards to interest only payments and started taking out cash advances. After a few months of this I maxed out around $80k in debt. I knew this was dumb, but fuck it! Somehow things panned out pretty well, and as of today I have finally broken even! What’s next: I’m going to keep rolling with this strategy, but will pair down the debt significantly. Mainly just the credit card debt, with a target around $20k debt, which at 25% utilization should be enough to get my credit score moving up again. Once I hit $500k, I’ll clear the debt fully. Takeaways: \\- Don’t short meme stocks \\- Short term options are not worth the risk \\- Learn from your mistakes and seek help \\- Loans are hard to get when you need them most For those who have a keen eye wondering why I already had losses prior to 2025, I sold my portfolio at another broker and moved it all into my current account in 2024. Moved it all over to my current account just to save transaction fees when punting it all on TSLA puts. Shockingly, the lower fees didn’t help much. \\-------- EDIT ---------- Seeing a lot of people saying they're in a similar position to me, so just to be clear: **I got lucky, and risked blowing my account up beyond repair. If you're in a similar position, please seek help** through Gamblers Anonymous or some other addition specialist. If you've had similar losses, you're almost certainly also a gambling addict, and the best thing you can do is get help for that before anything else.",

      "selftext_processed": "Been investing for years but I went all in on options mostly TSLA and CVNA puts earlier this year . Big mistake . Wiped out almost my entire account . Down from $ 120k to $ 5k in a matter of weeks . Turns out I have a bit of a gambling problem so options aren ’ t a good idea for me . Went back to basics aka penny stocks . I ’ ve got a lot of experience good and bad with small caps and decided to only focus on buying and holing long after doing extensive DD . Only issue is I didn ’ t have cash to play with . Fortunately I had excellent credit on account of always auto paying credit cards and never_taking out loans . So I called up all the financial institutions I had banked with and asked them for the biggest loans they would give me . This turned out to only be about $ 30k which wasn ’ t enough so I set my credit cards to interest only payments and started taking out cash advances . After a few months of this I maxed out around $ 80k in debt . I knew this was dumb but fuck it Somehow things panned out pretty well and as of today I have finally broken even What ’ s next I ’ m going to keep rolling with this strategy but will pair down the debt significantly . Mainly just the credit card debt with a target around $ 20k debt which at 25 % utilization should be enough to get my credit score moving up again . Once I hit $ 500k I ’ ll clear the debt fully . Takeaways Don ’ t short meme stocks Short term options are not_worth the risk Learn from your mistakes and seek help Loans are hard to get when you need them most For those who have a keen eye wondering why I already had losses prior to 2025 I sold my portfolio at another broker and moved it all into my current account in 2024 . Moved it all over to my current account just to save transaction fees when punting it all on TSLA puts . Shockingly the lower fees didn ’ t help much . EDIT Seeing a lot of people saying theyre in a similar position to me so just to be clear I got lucky and risked blowing my account up beyond repair . If youre in a similar position please seek help through Gamblers Anonymous or some other addition specialist . If youve had similar losses youre almost certainly also a gambling addict and the best thing you can do is get help for that before anything else ."

      "selftext": "I'd be curious to hear opinions on Wealthfront's recent IPO -- ticker WLTH. Not that it matters much, but my own background: The majority of my portfolio is pretty bog standard broad ETFs -- yes, the lion's share in a 401k with pretty boring allocations via your standard mix of blocks. I have a taxable investment account with Wealthfront *and* an individual account I use for individual equities. Why both? Well, I hit a jackpot in my individual account (bought into NVDA in 2020) and also had some other success stories... and ironically? I always told myself \"If you can't beat the robots, you're just spending money on a hobby\". 5+ years later - I'm still winning. So... that brings me to the individual stock in question. I'm a long-term, buy-and-hold guy. I **prefer** to invest in equities where I have some experience/knowledge of the underlying company. I bought into TOST at its trough a bit ago (\\~17) on the same front - profitable, but IPO out of the gate at \\~70. However, my brother is a restauranteur and through him, I've talked with plenty of others - and I felt it was really best-in-class, like their growth, and while not a huge win like NVDA? It's certainly paid off - and I continue to like it under \\~35. And... I've used Wealthfront - it's my primary HYSA nowadays (though not my only one, but my largest) and as noted, also have a taxable \"robo-ETF\" account with them. I've been a customer for nearly 7 years now -- and I *do* give them high marks. I really like the platform. I really like the ingenuity. As much as I don't avail myself? I also like them dipping into further fintech area. My baseline thoughts - On the plus side: \\- Fairly rare for an IPO to already be profitable. They are \\- The P/E looks fine - \\~15. \\- Still showing growth \\- Expanding offerings On the pause/minus side: \\- HIGHLY competitive space - when I chose Wealthfront? Nearly a coinflip between them and Betterment. Robinhood, a bazillion others -- HIGHLY competitive \\- Growth is tailing off - still growing, but no longer a multiplier. \\- Never had good luck with financials I don't believe in trying to \"time\" buys -- and as with nearly every IPO, they're bleeding off a bit. But... I like the company. Part of me wants to wait a few quarters and compare some 10-Qs... the other part says I like the company, like the financials, etc. Would love to hear other thoughts....",

      "selftext_processed": "Id be curious to hear opinions on Wealthfronts recent IPO ticker WLTH . Not_that it matters much but my own background The majority of my portfolio is pretty bog standard broad ETFs yes the lions share in a 401k with pretty boring allocations via your standard mix of blocks . I have a taxable investment account with Wealthfront and an individual account I use for individual equities . Why both Well I hit a jackpot in my individual account bought into NVDA in 2020 and also had some other success stories ... and ironically I always told myself If you cant beat the robots youre just spending money on a hobby . 5 years later Im still winning . So ... that brings me to the individual stock in question . Im a longterm buyandhold guy . I prefer to invest in equities where I have some experienceknowledge of the underlying company . I bought into TOST at its trough a bit ago 17 on the same front profitable but IPO out of the gate at 70 . However my brother is a restauranteur and through him Ive talked with plenty of others and I felt it was really bestinclass like their growth and while not_a huge win like NVDA Its certainly paid off and I continue to like it under 35 . And ... Ive used Wealthfront its my primary HYSA nowadays though not_my only one but my largest and as noted also have a taxable roboETF account with them . Ive been a customer for nearly 7 years now and I do give them high marks . I really like the platform . I really like the ingenuity . As much as I dont avail myself I also like them dipping into further fintech area . My baseline thoughts On the plus side Fairly rare for an IPO to already be profitable . They are The PE looks fine 15 . Still showing growth Expanding offerings On the pauseminus side HIGHLY competitive space when I chose Wealthfront Nearly a coinflip between them and Betterment . Robinhood a bazillion others HIGHLY competitive Growth is tailing off still growing but no_longer a multiplier . Never_had good luck with financials I dont believe in trying to time buys and as with nearly every IPO theyre bleeding off a bit . But ... I like the company . Part of me wants to wait a few quarters and compare some 10Qs ... the other part says I like the company like the financials etc . Would love to hear other thoughts ...."

It went public in September and the stock price is down 71%. It still trades at a $875M market cap and this makes no sense to me. This thing should be trading at no more than $250M. This is troublesome: \\- Its cash + accounts receivable balance as of Sep 2025 = $86M \\- It's net loss year-to-date as of Sep 2025 YTD = $92M \\- And it owes in current liabilities $113M as of Sep 2025 I don't know how this thing isn't already insolvent. The only thing it has going for it is that it has recurring annual revenue of $115M from its subscribers (although I've had two friends try to cancel their subscriptions and the process was painful for them). But the flip side of these subscribers is they are spending soooo much money to acquire and retain new subscribers. They spent $177M in sales and marketing YTD Sep 2025. This is insane! The unit economics don't work for this business, especially for a business that relies on 'hits'--getting a hit movie or series. I feel like this thing is going to $0.",

This is troublesome Its cash accounts receivable balance as of Sep 2025 $ 86M Its net loss yeartodate as of Sep 2025 YTD $ 92M And it owes in current liabilities $ 113M as of Sep 2025 I dont know how this thing isnt already insolvent . The only thing it has going for it is that it has recurring annual revenue of $ 115M from its subscribers although Ive had two friends try to cancel their subscriptions and the process was painful for them . But the flip side of these subscribers is they are spending soooo much money to acquire and retain new subscribers . They spent $ 177M in sales and marketing YTD Sep 2025 . This is insane The unit economics dont work for this business especially for a business that relies on hitsgetting a hit movie or series . I feel like this thing is going to $ 0 ."

      "selftext": "SP500 dips whenever there's an earning call, and Micron earning call probably make all of us bleed again this week, especially with the RAM fuckery going on. GLD is also full to the brim probably be pumped and dumped again once it hits 410, along with all shelter miners. Crypto-adjacent securities are not surging because crypto is still limp. Now yen is getting stronger, dollar getting cheaper, and cheap dollars are used to pump the same securities, and institutionals just swing trade from one earning call to the next. Nomura and Mizuho (ADRs) NMR / MFG are incredibly undervalued, two of the three top-tier Japanese banks, and these are the direct beneficiaries of a stronger yen and rising interest rates, and crafters of these new policies. They are two of the biggest corporate lenders and behind the first government-backed crypto stable yen, which basically means state-adjacent crypto finance from big lenders... the potential is quite huge. Nomura owns roughly half of Morgan Stanley, which still gets ignored. NMR’s financial division made a billion dollars using QQQ puts. NMR’s dividend yield is higher than most so-called dividend princesses or whatever the name is. MS has stated they want to do a USD stable coin, and NMR is the reason for that. They’ve been moving slowly in the ADRs, and have been two of my great portfolio shelters during this shit year. Price action alone (USD/JPY echange rate) is making this change, higher yen and lower dollar means you are effectively now buying more for less. Their share buybacks have turned very aggressive, and once the stable yen goes fully online worldwide and the USD version is also online, the deranged fantasy of getting cheap low-interest crypto insta loans send yen using a shit broker account to pay your shit mortgage or repay loans or flip exchange rates interests... will be not only a reality, but a practice.",

Price action alone USDJPY echange rate is making this change higher yen and lower dollar means you are effectively now buying more for less . Their share buybacks have turned very aggressive and once the stable yen goes fully online worldwide and the USD version is also online the deranged fantasy of getting cheap lowinterest crypto insta loans send yen using a shit broker account to pay your shit mortgage or repay loans or flip exchange rates interests ... will be not_only a reality but a practice ."

      "selftext": "I bought a bunch the last two days. These low prices are purely political. Turmp is close with MBS. They have been trading geopolitical favors for a while. Trump wants oil low, inflation down, MBS has been pumping despite the low prices. Usually this is when OPEC+ will turn it down. China has benefitted from the Venezuela, Russia, and Iran sanctions for years buying all their sanctioned oil on the discount. It’s not a huge amount, but taking their Venezuela 🇻🇪 production off the market will cause a disruption in this “private” market they have been stocking up on. If China has to start buying in the open market, oil prices are pretty inelastic on the short term. My average costs is $56.55 after averaging down some more today. Still have some limit orders if it drops more and will continue to load up. Quick math but I I own (65 contracts x $6 07 x 9x leverage per contract ) That’s like $355,000 of oil futures. It’s a lot of fun with the leverage! 1% in either directions and it’s like $5-10k. 🥭 might go on TV, nuke the Venezuela tankers, and we see a 2-3% movement no problem. This is any easy play. I have 3 months to wait this this out for a $20,000-30,000 gain if it hit $60+",

      "selftext": "# ETF Rebalance RGTI is facing a perfect storm this Friday, December 19th, with massive forced selling incoming. The $3.2B Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM) is rebalancing and must dump $30 million in RGTI shares and another $10 million in IONQ. This isn't speculation; it's a mechanical event. RGTI is also in other ETFs rebalancing the same day, meaning even more selling pressure is coming for a stock with a low float. Calculation: RGTI is part of other ETFs also the one's circled in red will be rebalanced on the 19-Dec and if the calculation is similar they will also sell RGTI is large quantities. Since most other ETFs are bond+stock type etfs with varied weighting we may see a slightly different outcome, but the point remains - RGTI has gone up over the quarter and unlike other companies it has a P/E that's negative EPS < 0 and stock price too high # Insider Selling continues While the ETFs are forced to sell, insiders have been voluntarily bailing for years. There have been **zero insider purchases since June 2022**. The latest sells were just days ago on December 10th. Most damning of all, **the CEO owns zero shares** in the company he runs. The people with all the information are showing zero confidence. Last sell was 7 days ago 9-Dec. This is happening to a company with laughable fundamentals. RGTI has a $10 billion market cap but generated less than $2 million in revenue last quarter. It's burning through $43.6 million in cash every 9 months, propped up by selling shares to retail investors. The valuation is a complete fantasy disconnected from reality. This Friday, a wave of forced selling is going to crash into a stock that insiders have already abandoned and that has no fundamental support. The correction is going to be brutal. **Position: +100 RGTZ. Total of 350 RGTZ.** NFA...obvi.",

      "selftext": "1. Forced Sellers vs. Optional Buyers This is the main issue * The Carry Trader: When the Yen spikes (because the BoJ hiked), these guys are underwater immediately. They aren’t selling U.S. stocks because they *want* to; they are selling because they are getting margin called. They are forced sellers. They need cash T-minus now. They hit the bid, regardless of the price. * The Domestic Buyer: Sure, U.S. rate cuts look good for stocks. But if you're a domestic investor, you aren't forced to buy *today*. You see the market tanking from the carry unwind and you think, \"I'll wait for the bottom.\" So you have a flood of \"sell at any price\" orders and a total lack of \"buy right now\" orders. That creates an air pocket, and prices freefall. 2. The 10x Multiplier Carry trades are almost never 1:1 with cash. They are highly leveraged, often 5x or 10x. If a fund unwinds a $1B carry trade, they might have to dump $5B to $10B worth of assets (like U.S. Tech stocks) to pay back the loan. A domestic buyer entering the market because of a 0.25% rate cut is likely buying with cash (1:1). Math: It takes 10 domestic buyers to absorb the damage of 1 carry trader blowing up. The volume mismatch is insane. 3. Convergence kills the trade You have to remember that the Carry Trade is purely an arbitrage play. It only exists because there is a massive gap (divergence) between U.S. and JP rates. * Wide Gap: Free money. Everyone piles in. * Gap Closing (Convergence): The free money is gone. The U.S. cutting rates actually accelerates the pain for the carry trader. It shrinks their profit margin from the U.S. side while the BoJ crushes them on the cost side. It’s not a \"meeting in the middle,\" it’s a pincer movement. TL;DR: Domestic buyers are walking into the store looking for bargains. Carry traders are running out of the store because the building is on fire. One group is much faster and more violent than the other.",

They hit the bid regardless of the price . The Domestic Buyer Sure U.S. rate cuts look good for stocks . But if youre a domestic investor you arent forced to buy today . You see the market tanking from the carry unwind and you think Ill wait for the bottom . So you have a flood of sell at any price orders and a total lack of buy right now orders . That creates an air pocket and prices freefall . 2 . The 10x Multiplier Carry trades are almost never_11 with cash . They are highly leveraged often 5x or 10x . If a fund unwinds a $ 1B carry trade they might have to dump $ 5B to $ 10B worth of assets like U.S. Tech stocks to pay back the loan . A domestic buyer entering the market because of a 0.25 % rate cut is likely buying with cash 11 . Math It takes 10 domestic buyers to absorb the damage of 1 carry trader blowing up .

The U.S. cutting rates actually accelerates the pain for the carry trader . It shrinks their profit margin from the U.S. side while the BoJ crushes them on the cost side .

      "selftext": "TLDR: Altria is a deep value buy. The US cig ecosystem is fundamentally misunderstood. The market doesn't see pouches as a growth vector for companies other than PMI and discounts the future attrition of customers (largely young, non smokers) from pouches to cigs that will inevitably result. If On!’s growth follows historical and grows near 60% CAGR it will account for more than 75% of the company's oral volume and drive the segment to generate more than 20% of Altria’s total revenue in 2029 (versus a negligible 3% total total volume in 2024). Altria bought Helix, which makes on!, for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on! did around 500M in revenue. The market has overlooked on! as a growth driver because its baked into the oral segment in Altria's earning reports, guidance, and financials, but it doesn't behave like an oral segment product -> its not chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not cigs. Once it grows to a point of financial significance in Altria's portfolio the market is going to **re-rate** the stock. [DCF]( Altria Group (MO) has a significant moat in the US cig market (45.8% of US Cigarette Market, 59.3% of US Premium Cigarette Market, 37.5% of US Smokeless Tobacco Market), but the problem is US cig sales have been declining YoY seemingly forever. And Altria's revenues reflect this to even more drastic extent. Cigs' share of nicotine market fell to a low of 60% in 2024 down from 90% in 2000. Broad industry growth is now driven exclusively by emerging markets (Altria operates only in the US in which \\~19% of Americans 15 or older currently use tobacco products vs \\~25% of Europeans 15 or olders). Altria's US cig moat and lack of apparent growth driver (they sold IQOS system to PMI -> IQOS is the future of vapes) is starting to be viewed by the market as a liability and as a result its trading at an extreme discount to peers. But Altria does have a growth driver, on! Altria bought Helix, which makes on!, for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on! did around 500M in revenue. US Pouch Market grew at an average annual rate of 50% 2020-2024. on! currently outpaces the growth of the US Pouches Market over the last 5 years growing at an average annual rate of 70%. Industry estimates project a US Nicotine Pouches Market CAGR of 28%-50% through 2034 ($250B+ Market). on! trails behind Zyn but still controls 30% market share in a near duopolistic environment. The market (and even Altria itself) is completely ignoring on! because as its stands now it is a inconsequential revenue or growth driver in Altria's portfolio. on!’s numbers are buried in Altria’s financials and earnings reports, combined with chewing tobacco as the total oral segment instead of a standalone “pouches” segment; on! doesn't behave like an oral segment product -> its not chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not cigs. In 2024 on! was only 20% of Altria’s oral units sold and accounted for only 2.4% of revenue. If on!’s historical growth rate of 60% continues through 2029 on! will be 75% of Altria’s oral volume and 25% of total revenue. on!’s trajectory positions it as a core earnings growth driver not yet rated by the market. The problem is that this DD implies a buy and hold and then wait for the market to catch up and rerate the stock, hoping all the while that the bleeding stops. Except not really. You're more than compensated for your time here. Altria maintains disciplined share repurchases and a stable dividend policy (78.6% Payout). The company has committed up to $2 billion in share repurchasing by the end of 2026, $1.3 billion remaining authorized. So here we get both buybacks and divs in a consumer staple that trades at a discount to peers in a macro environment with fearful sensibilities. And despite falling revenues, margins continue to grow with no sight of slowing down. Altria is largely insulated from tariffs given their domestic business model, and as pouches scale, margins will widen there as well. In fact, the more we look at revenues broadly, the more it looks over played. Not only do they grow margins at every mark, if we excise tax is taken out from COGS, it shows that Altria has cut cost at every corner. + if we read revenues net of excise tax it actually shows revenue growth But the thing that is most compelling here is that the US tobacco market is just fundamentally misunderstood. The market sees this well observed declining trend (declining consumption of tobacco products) and views it as baked in and linear. They think the future generations wont smoke and that cig is a staple of a dying breed. But this is not the case. It is a highly addictive drug that will continue to grow. The bottom of the sentiment is in. Joe rogan says cigs are good for you. Dr Huberman says cigs are good for you. Cigs are a nootropic that stimulate the mind and actually make you smarter and better looking and better at life. The evil tobacco barons of old couldn't have devised a better psyop to get people to smoke. The product is being authentically re-marketed to younger generations. & pouches growth is a manifestation of this. Pouches are not eating into cig sales in adding more speed to a declining trend, instead the decline is stable and the pouch growth is exponential. This implies significant customer acquisition to newer, non smoking, younger consumers. The research on this is highly contested as pouch research is new, but as these customers are acquired there will be some natural attrition to cigs. Some % (like 1 in 5) of non smoking pouch consumers will ultimately become cig consumers, and in the US Altria controls 50% of the cig market, so that moat that the market views more and more as a liability, will only prove to be more and more of an asset in the coming years. Regardless, the cigs are good for you psyop at the very least signal a bottoming out in the declining tobacco sentiment in the US, indicating the declining trend is a lot less sticky than the market has priced. I did a DCF which I've linked above which gave an intrinsic value of $78 with a MOS of 35%. I then did a sensitivity table under different conditions (bull v bear, see assumptions in the DCF but the primary are revenue broadly and revenue in on!). The DCF only affirmed the thesis. The bull case was achieved with declining revenues in each of Altria’s product lines except on! fck it i just posted one of the DCFs (base case) cuz idk if the links are gunna work so sorry about that but there you go. Basically the DD shows **BUY** & hold Altria (MO) for 5 Years or until market re-rates the stock as on! becomes a noticeable earnings growth driver and pouch industry customer acquisition growth results in customer attrition back to Altria’s US cigarette moat.

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Altria is a deep value buy . The US cig ecosystem is fundamentally misunderstood . The market doesnt see pouches as a growth vector for companies other than PMI and discounts the future attrition of customers largely young non smokers from pouches to cigs that will inevitably result . If On ’ s growth follows historical and grows near 60 % CAGR it will account for more than 75 % of the companys oral volume and drive the segment to generate more than 20 % of Altria ’ s total revenue in 2029 versus a negligible 3 % total total volume in 2024 . Altria bought Helix which makes on for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on did around 500M in revenue . The market has overlooked on as a growth driver because its baked into the oral segment in Altrias earning reports guidance and financials but it doesnt behave like an oral segment product its not_chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not_cigs . Once it grows to a point of financial significance in Altrias portfolio the market is going to rerate the stock . DCF Altria Group MO has a significant moat in the US cig market 45.8 % of US Cigarette Market 59.3 % of US Premium Cigarette Market 37.5 % of US Smokeless Tobacco Market but the problem is US cig sales have been declining YoY seemingly forever . And Altrias revenues reflect this to even more drastic extent . Cigs share of nicotine market fell to a low of 60 % in 2024 down from 90 % in 2000 . Broad industry growth is now driven exclusively by emerging markets Altria operates only in the US in which 19 % of Americans 15 or older currently use tobacco products vs 25 % of Europeans 15 or olders . Altrias US cig moat and lack of apparent growth driver they sold IQOS system to PMI IQOS is the future of vapes is starting to be viewed by the market as a liability and as a result its trading at an extreme discount to peers . But Altria does have a growth driver on Altria bought Helix which makes on for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on did around 500M in revenue . US Pouch Market grew at an average annual rate of 50 % 20202024. on currently outpaces the growth of the US Pouches Market over the last 5 years growing at an average annual rate of 70 % . Industry estimates project a US Nicotine Pouches Market CAGR of 28 % 50 % through 2034 $ 250B Market . on trails behind Zyn but still controls 30 % market share in a near duopolistic environment . The market and even Altria itself is completely ignoring on because as its stands now it is a inconsequential revenue or growth driver in Altrias portfolio . on ’ s numbers are buried in Altria ’ s financials and earnings reports combined with chewing tobacco as the total oral segment instead of a standalone “ pouches ” segment on doesnt behave like an oral segment product its not_chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not_cigs . In 2024 on was only 20 % of Altria ’ s oral units sold and accounted for only 2.4 % of revenue . If on ’ s historical growth rate of 60 % continues through 2029 on will be 75 % of Altria ’ s oral volume and 25 % of total revenue . on ’ s trajectory positions it as a core earnings growth driver not_yet rated by the market . The problem is that this DD implies a buy and hold and then wait for the market to catch up and rerate the stock hoping all the while that the bleeding stops . Except not_really . Youre more than compensated for your time here . Altria maintains disciplined share repurchases and a stable dividend policy 78.6 % Payout . The company has committed up to $ 2 billion in share repurchasing by the end of 2026 $ 1.3 billion remaining authorized . So here we get both buybacks and divs in a consumer staple that trades at a discount to peers in a macro environment with fearful sensibilities . And despite falling revenues margins continue to grow with no_sight of slowing down . Altria is largely insulated from tariffs given their domestic business model and as pouches scale margins will widen there as well . In fact the more we look at revenues broadly the more it looks over played . Not_only do they grow margins at every mark if we excise tax is taken out from COGS it shows that Altria has cut cost at every corner . if we read revenues net of excise tax it actually shows revenue growth But the thing that is most compelling here is that the US tobacco market is just fundamentally misunderstood . The market sees this well observed declining trend declining consumption of tobacco products and views it as baked in and linear . They think the future generations wont smoke and that cig is a staple of a dying breed . But this is not_the case . It is a highly addictive drug that will continue to grow . The bottom of the sentiment is in . Joe rogan says cigs are good for you . Dr Huberman says cigs are good for you . Cigs are a nootropic that stimulate the mind and actually make you smarter and better looking and better at life . The evil tobacco barons of old couldnt have devised a better psyop to get people to smoke . The product is being authentically remarketed to younger generations . pouches growth is a manifestation of this . Pouches are not_eating into cig sales in adding more speed to a declining trend instead the decline is stable and the pouch growth is exponential . This implies significant customer acquisition to newer non smoking younger consumers . The research on this is highly contested as pouch research is new but as these customers are acquired there will be some natural attrition to cigs . Some % like 1 in 5 of non smoking pouch consumers will ultimately become cig consumers and in the US Altria controls 50 % of the cig market so that moat that the market views more and more as a liability will only prove to be more and more of an asset in the coming years . Regardless the cigs are good for you psyop at the very least signal a bottoming out in the declining tobacco sentiment in the US indicating the declining trend is a lot less sticky than the market has priced . I did a DCF which Ive linked above which gave an intrinsic value of $ 78 with a MOS of 35 % . I then did a sensitivity table under different conditions bull v bear see assumptions in the DCF but the primary are revenue broadly and revenue in on . The DCF only affirmed the thesis . The bull case was achieved with declining revenues in each of Altria ’ s product lines except on fck it i just posted one of the DCFs base case cuz idk if the links are gunna work so sorry about that but there you go . Basically the DD shows BUY hold Altria MO for 5 Years or until market rerates the stock as on becomes a noticeable earnings growth driver and pouch industry customer acquisition growth results in customer attrition back to Altria ’ s US cigarette moat .
