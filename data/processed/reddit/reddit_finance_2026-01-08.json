      "selftext": "I have been thinking about something I don’t see discussed here very often. When we talk about investing, most conversations revolve around market returns, stocks, ETFs, or macro trends. But when it comes to small businesses, private companies, or potential acquisitions, I wonder if we sometimes overlook a key factor: how well the business actually plans its finances. From what I’ve seen, businesses that take financial planning seriously tend to behave very differently from those that only chase growth numbers. They don’t just ask “Can we make more money this year?” but also * What happens if revenue drops? * How much cash should be kept aside? * When does reinvesting actually make sense? I recently came across how some accounting and advisory firms structure this kind of thinking for entrepreneurs (for example, firms like JTC CPAs that focus on business planning rather than just filing taxes). What stood out wasn’t aggressive growth tactics, but risk management, sustainability, and long-term decision making. Which made me think… From an investor’s perspective, especially when evaluating * private companies * small businesses * or long-term holdings **Is disciplined financial planning actually more valuable than rapid growth?** Have you seen cases where a company with strong internal planning outperformed a faster-growing but less structured business over time? Curious to hear how others here think about this.",

Gemini shows up where questions already live inside Search, Chrome, Android & Workspace so new AI usage does not require a new habit, a new app or a new URL but it simply shows up.\" \\----- But I wonder the real reason behind this rise in traffic could be something else. Gemini has offered 1 year of free\\* subscription to Pro for Indian users. And it's one of the largest markets. So the rise in traffic could simply be because of that. So, it may not be because of Geminis superior tech or access to Search, Chrome, Android & Workspace. It's simply due to free subscriptions. In that case, there's a good chance that these numbers could drop once the free offering ends, given how price sensitive Indians are.",

Gemini shows up where questions already live inside Search Chrome Android Workspace so new AI usage does not_require a new habit a new app or a new URL but it simply shows up . But I wonder the real reason behind this rise in traffic could be something else . Gemini has offered 1 year of free subscription to Pro for Indian users . And its one of the largest markets . So the rise in traffic could simply be because of that . So it may not_be because of Geminis superior tech or access to Search Chrome Android Workspace . Its simply due to free subscriptions . In that case theres a good chance that these numbers could drop once the free offering ends given how price sensitive Indians are ."

      "selftext": "This is not financial advice but my perspective is a bit more nuanced than most because of observations I've made over the last 20+ years working with the F500 in two capacities. I spent many years selling data centers and IP related services to Microsoft, Amazon, Meta (when they were still called Facebook) and many, many others. I managed a team of salespeople in Asia and Europe from my office in Seattle. For the past 6+ years, I've gotten a deeper perspective, working with the corporate development departments of nearly all the F500 as the head of business development for a small $100M PE firm headquartered in London. First off, what the hell is \"Corporate Development?\" Y ou may know what that is but I didn't know what it was coming into the job and I had a law degree and was racking up huge annual bonuses per year selling dark fiber and triple redundant data centers to Dell in northern England and Japanese data centers with Zen sand gardens in the middle to Microsoft. Corporate Development or \"CD\" as they call themselves, are the \"deal guys.\" When you hear about an M&A deal or an investment in an adjacent company or the spin off of a division or the sale of IP, you can bet the CD team was involved. When you see a F500 company putting out job listing for CD help, your spider sense should start tingling. Deal flow must be happening soon. Great. Why should I care? Because you shouldn't be investing in companies unless you understand how their CD team works. I'm old enough to remember teletype, punch cards and fax machines. All gone. And those who invested in them likely lost money if they stuck around. I haven't talked to all of the F500 - I avoided Biotech - but I spoke to nearly all of them. What I learned changed my perspective on investing. The entire F500 is a pack of Zebras. The overwhelming majority of them don't want to be the first or last Zebra in the pack. Aside from a small handful, the pressure is too great for people to come in to work, use M&A to add a bit or revenue here, add an adjacent product line there, or maybe fill in product line with a tuck-in technology. Nothing that rocks the massive ship that cranks out a consistent 10% growth and 1.5% dividends. What's with M&A in the first place? Why is that needed? M&A, like strategic investments, is the innovation lifeblood of the vast majority of companies because they have lost the ability to innovate. Entirely. The people who show up at Coca Cola Inc can't think of any new products that are going to meaningfully move the needle so they wind up acquiring a small African firm that has highly caffeinated coke-flavored carbonated Yak milk and await their bonus check. The Zebras that don't give their CD team any meaningful work eventually lose their best CD people because great deal people are always in demand and so those companies... slowly.. drift... to the back of the zebra herd in innovation and eventually go the way of fax machines. They'll up their dividends to keep your attention while they show up for work and reap the rewards of their hard working, innovative predecessors. When you're investing in a company you need to know this. Because ALL of investing is RISK in and REWARD out. Too often we get laser focused on the Reward and we overlook the risk. Many times we don't take enough risk and that's just as big a problem as it is for someone who goes YOLO on Fartcoins. The companies that are innovating are taking calculated risks. You're betting that the CD team at Google or Tesla or a very, very small handful of others are sharp enough to win the majority of their risk taking bets because, over time, those Zebras out in front get a good long look at the opportunities on the prairie while the rest of the Zebras are staring at black and white striped asses. There's nothing wrong with getting 10% growth + 2% yield each year if that's what you want. But if I were younger (I'm older than dirt) and knew what I knew now, I would invest half my money in the innovators. Because, over time, the market has taught us that you must put some amount of risk in if you want some amount of outsized returns. NFA/DYOR and thanks for reading. TL/DR: Most of the F500 either refuse or are incapable of innovation and that means that you may be betting on fax machines to continue up and to the right.",

      "selftext_processed": "This is not_financial advice but my perspective is a bit more nuanced than most because of observations Ive made over the last 20 years working with the F500 in two capacities . I spent many years selling data centers and IP related services to Microsoft Amazon Meta when they were still called Facebook and many many others . I managed a team of salespeople in Asia and Europe from my office in Seattle . For the past 6 years Ive gotten a deeper perspective working with the corporate development departments of nearly all the F500 as the head of business development for a small $ 100M PE firm headquartered in London . First off what the hell is Corporate Development Y ou may know what that is but I didnt know what it was coming into the job and I had a law degree and was racking up huge annual bonuses per year selling dark fiber and triple redundant data centers to Dell in northern England and Japanese data centers with Zen sand gardens in the middle to Microsoft . Corporate Development or CD as they call themselves are the deal guys . When you hear about an MA deal or an investment in an adjacent company or the spin off of a division or the sale of IP you can bet the CD team was involved . When you see a F500 company putting out job listing for CD help your spider sense should start tingling . Deal flow must be happening soon . Great . Why should I care Because you shouldnt be investing in companies unless you understand how their CD team works . Im old enough to remember teletype punch cards and fax machines . All gone . And those who invested in them likely lost money if they stuck around . I havent talked to all of the F500 I avoided Biotech but I spoke to nearly all of them . What I learned changed my perspective on investing . The entire F500 is a pack of Zebras . The overwhelming majority of them dont want to be the first or last Zebra in the pack . Aside from a small handful the pressure is too great for people to come in to work use MA to add a bit or revenue here add an adjacent product line there or maybe fill in product line with a tuckin technology . Nothing_that rocks the massive ship that cranks out a consistent 10 % growth and 1.5 % dividends . Whats with MA in the first place Why is that needed MA like strategic investments is the innovation lifeblood of the vast majority of companies because they have lost the ability to innovate . Entirely . The people who show up at Coca Cola Inc cant think of any new products that are going to meaningfully move the needle so they wind up acquiring a small African firm that has highly caffeinated cokeflavored carbonated Yak milk and await their bonus check . The Zebras that dont give their CD team any meaningful work eventually lose their best CD people because great deal people are always in demand and so those companies ... slowly .. drift ... to the back of the zebra herd in innovation and eventually go the way of fax machines . Theyll up their dividends to keep your attention while they show up for work and reap the rewards of their hard working innovative predecessors . When youre investing in a company you need to know this . Because ALL of investing is RISK in and REWARD out . Too often we get laser focused on the Reward and we overlook the risk . Many times we dont take enough risk and thats just as big a problem as it is for someone who goes YOLO on Fartcoins . The companies that are innovating are taking calculated risks . Youre betting that the CD team at Google or Tesla or a very very small handful of others are sharp enough to win the majority of their risk taking bets because over time those Zebras out in front get a good long look at the opportunities on the prairie while the rest of the Zebras are staring at black and white striped asses . Theres nothing_wrong with getting 10 % growth 2 % yield each year if thats what you want . But if I were younger Im older than dirt and knew what I knew now I would invest half my money in the innovators . Because over time the market has taught us that you must put some amount of risk in if you want some amount of outsized returns . NFADYOR and thanks for reading . TLDR Most of the F500 either refuse or are incapable of innovation and that means that you may be betting on fax machines to continue up and to the right ."

      "title": "The Nigerian economy is fraudulent and still won't short the Naira",
      "selftext": "Inflated population, low electricity output, fake GDP numbers...and? When did a little fraud ever hold back an economy? Jokes aside, you will probably lose your money if you short the Naira (or economy at large). Unless you happen to have more liquidity than the Federal Government of Nigeria, and well...only one of you sits on 30 billion barrels of oil. Still, don't just take my word for it. There are actually some things to consider as to why the factors that historically weaken the Naira are not as relevant anymore, and aren't looking to become relevant again. Importation First, by far the biggest FX drain on Nigeria is money spent on importation of refined petroleum products. Dangote Refinery almost singlehandedly means that this is a non-issue moving forward. [Already, fuel import bills have declined significantly]( and will continue to do so as production ramps up. So, you get domestic production by a company that pays taxes, hires people who also pay taxes, reduces the import bills, and also increase the exports? It's not just petrol either, its petroleum products. So aviation fuel, plastics, diesel? All cheaper. Speculation/Arbitrage If you watched the Naira under the previous administration, they ran a dual exchange rate system where you could get cheap (subsidised) dollars from the CBN. However, people just took it to the black market, where they sold it for a tidy markup. Obvious disaster. That is gone, and the removal of that system (and fuel subsidies which cost $10 billion in 2022 alone) means that what is another significant FX problem to the Nigerian government is a non-issue moving forward. Just 4 months after it was ended in 2023 (Tinubu administration takes over), [and the FG has saved appox. 1.5 trillion Naira]( That shock caused the \"official\" value of the Naira to decline sharply, but it has corrected itself, and remained stable ever since. Inflation Because of a lack of proper centralized power supply, most Nigerians rely on petrol to power their lives. This means that a change in petrol prices (fuel subsidies were removed) causes a change in the price of literally everything else. Inflation was at 35% in December 2024, and by November 2025 it was at 14.45% Now, the NBS did some revision of the CPI, so a part of that decline is probably a sleight of hand. Still. Like I said, petrol prices control the prices of everything else in Nigeria. And because of Dangote's Refinery (you really cannot overstate the impact), [fuel prices went from a high of about N1300 per liter in March, to N699 in January 2026. ](#:~:text=With%20retail%20prices%20potentially%20dropping,remained%20stubbornly%20elevated%20throughout%202025.) FG Revenue Historically the FG has relied on oil sales to fund itself. This is clearly unsustainable, and oil prices are likely to continue falling in the near future. From Jan 1, 2026 Nigeria will be operating under a much more coherent tax system, and the FG is (for obvious reasons) very hellbent on raising tax revenues. Higher Federal revenues means less borrowing, which is less debt servicing and more building infrastructure that boosts economic productivity, which raises revenue and the cycle goes on. As a case study, a state called Enugu has managed to raise its internally generated revenue (IGR) from N34 billion in 2023, to N180 billion in 2024, projects N600 billion in 2025, and N870 billion in 2026. [Capital expenditure was 84% in 2025, and is projected to be 80% in 2026]( Electricity On the electricity side of things, while the actual electric output is low, there are some fundamental reasons to this. One of which is a 6 trillion Naira debt that the FG owes to GenCos. The FG has plans to issue [4 trillion Naira]( in bonds to pay most of it off, so that won't be (as much) of an issue, and gives GenCos the room to produce more power (they don't run at capacity). There are other more minor things. The FG plans to conduct a census, National IDs are becoming mandated, Cement production (for housing and road construction) is ramping up, fertilizer production, I could go on. The foundations that are required to slowly build an actual economy are slowly being built up. So no, I will not be shorting the Naira or Nigeria, and you probably shouldn't either.",

      "selftext_processed": "Inflated population low electricity output fake GDP numbers ... and When did a little fraud ever hold back an economy Jokes aside you will probably lose your money if you short the Naira or economy at large . Unless you happen to have more liquidity than the Federal Government of Nigeria and well ... only one of you sits on 30 billion barrels of oil . Still dont just take my word for it . There are actually some things to consider as to why the factors that historically weaken the Naira are not_as relevant anymore and arent looking to become relevant again . Importation First by far the biggest FX drain on Nigeria is money spent on importation of refined petroleum products . Dangote Refinery almost singlehandedly means that this is a nonissue moving forward . Already fuel import bills have declined significantly and will continue to do so as production ramps up . So you get domestic production by a company that pays taxes hires people who also pay taxes reduces the import bills and also increase the exports Its not_just petrol either its petroleum products . So aviation fuel plastics diesel All cheaper . SpeculationArbitrage If you watched the Naira under the previous administration they ran a dual exchange rate system where you could get cheap subsidised dollars from the CBN . However people just took it to the black market where they sold it for a tidy markup . Obvious disaster . That is gone and the removal of that system and fuel subsidies which cost $ 10 billion in 2022 alone means that what is another significant FX problem to the Nigerian government is a nonissue moving forward . Just 4 months after it was ended in 2023 Tinubu administration takes over and the FG has saved appox . 1.5 trillion Naira That shock caused the official value of the Naira to decline sharply but it has corrected itself and remained stable ever since . Inflation Because of a lack of proper centralized power supply most Nigerians rely on petrol to power their lives . This means that a change in petrol prices fuel subsidies were removed causes a change in the price of literally everything else . Inflation was at 35 % in December 2024 and by November 2025 it was at 14.45 % Now the NBS did some revision of the CPI so a part of that decline is probably a sleight of hand . Still . Like I said petrol prices control the prices of everything else in Nigeria . And because of Dangotes Refinery you really can not overstate the impact fuel prices went from a high of about N1300 per liter in March to N699 in January 2026. textWith % 20retail % 20prices % 20potentially % 20droppingremained % 20stubbornly % 20elevated % 20throughout % 202025 . FG Revenue Historically the FG has relied on oil sales to fund itself . This is clearly unsustainable and oil prices are likely to continue falling in the near future . From Jan 1 2026 Nigeria will be operating under a much more coherent tax system and the FG is for obvious reasons very hellbent on raising tax revenues . Higher Federal revenues means less borrowing which is less debt servicing and more building infrastructure that boosts economic productivity which raises revenue and the cycle goes on . As a case study a state called Enugu has managed to raise its internally generated revenue IGR from N34 billion in 2023 to N180 billion in 2024 projects N600 billion in 2025 and N870 billion in 2026 . Capital expenditure was 84 % in 2025 and is projected to be 80 % in 2026 Electricity On the electricity side of things while the actual electric output is low there are some fundamental reasons to this . One of which is a 6 trillion Naira debt that the FG owes to GenCos . The FG has plans to issue 4 trillion Naira in bonds to pay most of it off so that wont be as much of an issue and gives GenCos the room to produce more power they dont run at capacity . There are other more minor things . The FG plans to conduct a census National IDs are becoming mandated Cement production for housing and road construction is ramping up fertilizer production I could go on . The foundations that are required to slowly build an actual economy are slowly being built up . So no_I will not_be shorting the Naira or Nigeria and you probably shouldnt either ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, this is my next play: I am buying $30 calls expiring 1/30 for $SOFI. This play is a reversal/earnings play. SOFI has reached a bottom at the $26 range, and has since bounced to 26.98, where it closed. Here is my thesis: First off, SoFi is a digital financial services company that offers banking, loans, investing, and personal finance tools all in one app to help users manage, borrow, and grow their money. I am bullish for a few reasons: SOFI has demonstrated some very rapid growth over the past couple of quarters. For example, they added roughly 850k members, bringing the total membership to 11-12 million. SOFI is also diversifying its revenue stream by no longer being just a lender; it now earns meaningful revenue from financial services and technology platforms. SOFI is also adding alternative private-market funds and AI tools to their platform. Now on the financial side of things: SOFI’s revenue and GAAP profitability have been rapidly growing this year. Q1 revenue- $772M Q2 revenue- $855M Q3 revenue- $950M Q1 GAAP- $71M Q2 GAAP- $97M Q3 GAAP- $139.4M As you can see, both the revenue and GAAP are growing each year, which is bullish. Management has raised guidance, including forecasts for higher revenue, earnings, and adjusted EBITDA. Note: SOFI is down because they had a share offering, big names like Goldman Sachs, BOA, and Citigroup bought. Therefore, smart money is getting in right now. In conclusion, I am very bullish on this play as SOFI has demonstrated remarkable earnings lately and checks multiple boxes. SOFI has found a bottom and recently bounced off 26, showing that it has found support. SOFI has earnings coming up at the end of the month, so I believe that buying in now at essentially the bottom is perfect timing to ride these until the days leading up to the release of the earnings.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everyone this is my next play I am buying $ 30 calls expiring 130 for $ SOFI . This play is a reversalearnings play . SOFI has reached a bottom at the $ 26 range and has since bounced to 26.98 where it closed . Here is my thesis First off SoFi is a digital financial services company that offers banking loans investing and personal finance tools all in one app to help users manage borrow and grow their money . I am bullish for a few reasons SOFI has demonstrated some very rapid growth over the past couple of quarters . For example they added roughly 850k members bringing the total membership to 1112 million . SOFI is also diversifying its revenue stream by no_longer being just a lender it now earns meaningful revenue from financial services and technology platforms . SOFI is also adding alternative privatemarket funds and AI tools to their platform . Now on the financial side of things SOFI ’ s revenue and GAAP profitability have been rapidly growing this year . Q1 revenue $ 772M Q2 revenue $ 855M Q3 revenue $ 950M Q1 GAAP $ 71M Q2 GAAP $ 97M Q3 GAAP $ 139.4M As you can see both the revenue and GAAP are growing each year which is bullish . Management has raised guidance including forecasts for higher revenue earnings and adjusted EBITDA . Note SOFI is down because they had a share offering big names like Goldman Sachs BOA and Citigroup bought . Therefore smart money is getting in right now . In conclusion I am very bullish on this play as SOFI has demonstrated remarkable earnings lately and checks multiple boxes . SOFI has found a bottom and recently bounced off 26 showing that it has found support . SOFI has earnings coming up at the end of the month so I believe that buying in now at essentially the bottom is perfect timing to ride these until the days leading up to the release of the earnings ."

      "selftext": "Me (25M) and my wife (28F) have no debt except our mortgage which is $1,821 a month and then our bills/insurance. We make around $10,000-$11,000 a month and have $30,000 sitting in our savings account from selling our first house rn. I receive a 2% raise every year and a few major bumps here and there to account for the market in my career, while her business is steadily growing more and more (she makes almost double what I do). We plan on doubling our mortgage every month towards the principal with an extra $1,821, then use an extra $2,000 a month to invest, and use the rest on wants like renovating our house, traveling, ect and throwing whatever is left for the month in a HYSA. The goal is the hopefully retire within the next 20 years and living off of our investments and my wife’s business while she takes a back seat and lets her employees bring us income (she co-owns a dog grooming and boarding business but just hired 2 more groomers) and slowly move a percentage of our investments into bonds as we get closer to retirement. I’m still in the beginning stages of my research on investing but basically my question is, would just investing the $2,000 into VOO and VTI right now be good for our situation and goals?",

We make around $ 10000 $ 11000 a month and have $ 30000 sitting in our savings account from selling our first house rn . I receive a 2 % raise every year and a few major bumps here and there to account for the market in my career while her business is steadily growing more and more she makes almost double what I do . We plan on doubling our mortgage every month towards the principal with an extra $ 1821 then use an extra $ 2000 a month to invest and use the rest on wants like renovating our house traveling ect and throwing whatever is left for the month in a HYSA . The goal is the hopefully retire within the next 20 years and living off of our investments and my wife ’ s business while she takes a back seat and lets her employees bring us income she coowns a dog grooming and boarding business but just hired 2 more groomers and slowly move a percentage of our investments into bonds as we get closer to retirement . I ’ m still in the beginning stages of my research on investing but basically my question is would just investing the $ 2000 into VOO and VTI right now be good for our situation and goals"

      "title": "Trump proposes massive increase in 2027 defense spending to $1.5 trillion to build 'Dream Military'",
      "selftext": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed setting military spending at $1.5 trillion in 2027, citing \"troubled and dangerous times.\" Trump called for the massive surge in spending days after he ordered a U.S. military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and spirit him out of the country to face drug trafficking charges in the United States. U.S. forces continue to mass in the Caribbean Sea. The 2026 military budget is set at $901 billion. Trump in recent days has also called for taking over the Danish territory of Greenland for national security reasons and has suggested he's open to carrying out military operations in Colombia. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ominously warned that longtime adversary Cuba \"is in trouble.\" \"This will allow us to build the 'Dream Military' that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,\" Trump said in a posting on Truth Social announcing his proposal. He added that he feels comfortable surging spending on the military because of increased revenue created by his administration through tariffs imposed on friends and foes around the globe since his return to office. Meanwhile, Trump on Wednesday also threatened to cut off Pentagon purchases from Raytheon, one of the biggest U.S. defense contractors, if the company did not end the practice of stock buybacks and invest more profits into building out its weapons manufacturing capacity. Trump in recent months has repeatedly complained that defense companies have been woefully behind on deliveries of critical weaponry, yet continue to mete out dividends and stock buybacks to investors and offering eye-popping salaries to top executives. \"Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with Department of War,\" Trump said on social media. \"Also, if Raytheon wants further business with the United States Government, under no circumstances will they be allowed to do any additional Stock Buybacks, where they have spent Tens of Billions of Dollars, until they are able to get their act together.\" [",

      "title": "The Nigerian economy is fraudulent and I'm shorting the fucking Naira",
      "selftext": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not exist in the form claimed. The country's GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through: • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever \"discover\" growth, never decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals. When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy. The first Pillar: Energy Delusion You cannot run a $250-billion economy on Nigeria's electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services. The numbers don't compute, they're physically impossible. Here's some context: |A|**B**| |:-|:-| |Nigeria electricity per capita|**\\~140-180 kWh/year**| |Sub-Saharan Africa average|\\~400 kWh/year| |Brazil (for comparison)|\\~3,295 kWh/year| |Peak grid generation (March 2025)|**5,801 MW (celebrated as record)**| |Private generator capacity|\\~14,000 MW (half of all consumption)| Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated. Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers, they're effectively running factories on diesel generators. This is not an economy growing at 3% as claimed, it's an economy bleeding money to stay functional. Pillar 2: They're back to defending the Naira |**2025 FX Intervention**|**Amount**| |:-|:-| |CBN dollars sold to defend naira|**$7.53 billion**| |YoY reserve increase|$4.62 billion| |Net position|**-$2.91 billion (burning reserves)**| |Current reserves|\\~$45 billion| They're spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves. The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased, not earned. Inevitably these interventions will stop, either due to reserve depletion, election spending or an oil price shock (hello Venezuelan capacity!) Pillar 3: The biggest smoking gun: Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6% to \\~11% of GDP in the 2025 rebasing, a massive portion of this is 'imputed rent' - the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves. For context: Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for. Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP. This is done in a lot of countries. So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it? 1, They have no functional property registry to establish actual values. 2, 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3, Properties counted at \"market rent\" usually don't even have running water or electricity 4, The valuation method is impossible to audit, and is infalsifiable They're not measuring wealth that exists, they're measuring desperation, adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP. Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage. Pillar 4: The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing \"discovers\" sectors that conveniently offset dying ones. The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction: up. |**Rebasing Year**|**GDP \"Explosion\"**|**\"Discovered\" Sector**| |:-|:-|:-| |2014|**+89%**|Telecoms & Nollywood| |2025|**+35%**|Fintech & Real Estate| The have never once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better. Countries around the world, including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing. Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure. 2025 Sector Shift |**Sector**|**Old Share**|**New Share**| |:-|:-|:-| |Industry/Manufacturing|27.7%|21.1% ↓| |Services (ICT/Trade)|50.2%|55.5% ↑| |Real Estate|6.2%|10.8% ↑| Manufacturing collapses, gets relabeled to 'services', oil falls, gets offset by 'discovering' fintech. The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be. With this thesis and Nigeria's own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data, I think the Naira, worthless as it is, is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct. I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane, the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025. On power: \"The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head. Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that.\" On growth targets: \"If you are to get from $250 billion to $1 trillion in 5 years, it means the economy has to grow at 15%. But you are growing at 3%.\" On real estate: \"Real estate will not generate dollars for you. Oil and gas will generate dollars.\" On the trajectory: \"The economy is limping its way into recovery, not leaping.\" On living standards: \"The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago.\" This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media, telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs, the growth targets are fantasy, and living standards have declined over 15 years. He's an insider, not a shortseller. Edit: Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubu's term that he stole the last election from popular reformist, Peter Obi. He's confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before, an agrarian export-focused Nigeria with no currency protections. If he wins, the protections are gone, the Naira tumbles. If he wins, but Tinubu steals it from him again, markets send the naira tumbling anyway.",

      "selftext_processed": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not_exist in the form claimed . The countrys GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever discover growth never_decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria CBN is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals . When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy . The first Pillar Energy Delusion You can not run a $ 250billion economy on Nigerias electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services . The numbers dont compute theyre physically impossible . Heres some context AB Nigeria electricity per capita140180 kWhyear SubSaharan Africa average400 kWhyear Brazil for comparison3295 kWhyear Peak grid generation March 20255801 MW celebrated as record Private generator capacity14000 MW half of all consumption Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated . Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers theyre effectively running factories on diesel generators . This is not_an economy growing at 3 % as claimed its an economy bleeding money to stay functional . Pillar 2 Theyre back to defending the Naira 2025 FX InterventionAmount CBN dollars sold to defend naira $ 7.53 billion YoY reserve increase $ 4.62 billion Net position $ 2.91 billion burning reserves Current reserves $ 45 billion Theyre spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves . The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased not_earned . Inevitably these interventions will stop either due to reserve depletion election spending or an oil price shock hello Venezuelan capacity Pillar 3 The biggest smoking gun Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6 % to 11 % of GDP in the 2025 rebasing a massive portion of this is imputed rent the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves . For context Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for . Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP . This is done in a lot of countries . So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it 1 They have no_functional property registry to establish actual values . 2 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3 Properties counted at market rent usually dont even have running water or electricity 4 The valuation method is impossible to audit and is infalsifiable Theyre not_measuring wealth that exists theyre measuring desperation adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP . Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage . Pillar 4 The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing discovers sectors that conveniently offset dying ones . The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction up . Rebasing YearGDP ExplosionDiscovered Sector 201489 % Telecoms Nollywood 202535 % Fintech Real Estate The have never_once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better . Countries around the world including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing . Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure . 2025 Sector Shift SectorOld ShareNew Share IndustryManufacturing27.7 % 21.1 % ↓ Services ICTTrade50.2 % 55.5 % ↑ Real Estate6.2 % 10.8 % ↑ Manufacturing collapses gets relabeled to services oil falls gets offset by discovering fintech . The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be . With this thesis and Nigerias own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data I think the Naira worthless as it is is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct . I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025 . On power The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head . Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that . On growth targets If you are to get from $ 250 billion to $ 1 trillion in 5 years it means the economy has to grow at 15 % . But you are growing at 3 % . On real estate Real estate will not_generate dollars for you . Oil and gas will generate dollars . On the trajectory The economy is limping its way into recovery not_leaping . On living standards The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago . This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs the growth targets are fantasy and living standards have declined over 15 years . Hes an insider not_a shortseller . Edit Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubus term that he stole the last election from popular reformist Peter Obi . Hes confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before an agrarian exportfocused Nigeria with no_currency protections . If he wins the protections are gone the Naira tumbles . If he wins but Tinubu steals it from him again markets send the naira tumbling anyway ."

      "selftext": "Google parent company Alphabet saw its market capitalization surpass Apple’s for the first time since 2019. Alphabet’s market cap closed at $3.88 trillion on Wednesday, while Apple’s market cap closed Wednesday at $3.84 trillion The positional inversion in market cap underscores the different directions that Alphabet and Apple are heading in when it comes to their respective strategies for artificial intelligence. The positional inversion in market cap underscores the different directions that Alphabet and Apple are heading in when it comes to their respective strategies for artificial intelligence. Alphabet ended 2025 as one of the top performers on Wall Street after putting together the pieces for its AI comeback. In November, the company unveiled Ironwood, the seventh generation of its tensor processing units, a custom AI chip that has emerged as a potential alternative to Nvidia’s offerings. Then in December, Google introduced Gemini 3 to rave reviews. Shares of Alphabet jumped 65% in 2025, the company’s sharpest rally since 2009, when the stock doubled coming out of the financial crisis. CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the company is responding to soaring demand. On Alphabet’s October earnings call, he said that Google’s cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter of the year than in the two prior years combined. Meanwhile, Apple has remained largely absent from the tech industry’s AI race that kicked off when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022. Apple was supposed to launch the next generation of its Siri AI assistant last year, but the company wound up delaying that release. Apple has promised to launch the “more personal Siri” in 2026.",

What I did all last year was keep that 35k as cash, Sell a put or spread, immediately buy SGOV with the premium received, sell SGOV when I need to BTC, profit goes to my core long term hold tickers. I did really well, 45% return in 2025. This year I took that 35k and bought SGOV, increased margin and now my SGOV is my collateral. I only open trades to a max of 35k collateral so I have the funds to cover max loss on everything in SGOV. This seems like I'm borrowing but my cash balance is positive so I don't think I'll be charged interest and I'll actually make a little over $100 a month from SGOV which I was missing out on before. Am I missing something something here? I understand the inherent risks of my strategy but I'm only asking about the use of margin. Setting my borrowing limit to like 100k is scary but I don't think there is any way to actually borrow that much in my current system.",

      "selftext": "Everyone is freaking out because the new Vera Rubin racks are 100% liquid cooled without the need for a mechanical chiller. But, MOD sells dry chillers! In fact, they are probably similar positioned as Vertiv because they sell a range of products that will benefit from the new Vera Rubin server racks. By the way, when a hyperscaler deploys the new Vera Rubin rack, they won't replace all of the chips inside of the building. Probably they will replace the racks section by section as they get inventory. A data center in 2028 will likely have a ton of different chips inside, **most** needing traditional chillers. By the way, people always forget that data centers need redundant cooling products in their buildings due to REGULATION. This is due to ambient heat created from the server racks. Making the products that Vertiv and Modine sell ESSENTIAL to all data centers through the unforeseeable future. If data centers are being deployed, they are getting there products from Vertiv, Mod, TT, etc. Since Monday, the stock is down roughly 14% due to nothing besides this Vera Rubin rack nonsense. Buy back in, we're going to $200 once people realize this. I believe their order backlog will continue to increase because of the reasons above.",

But MOD sells dry chillers In fact they are probably similar positioned as Vertiv because they sell a range of products that will benefit from the new Vera Rubin server racks . By the way when a hyperscaler deploys the new Vera Rubin rack they wont replace all of the chips inside of the building . Probably they will replace the racks section by section as they get inventory . A data center in 2028 will likely have a ton of different chips inside most needing traditional chillers . By the way people always forget that data centers need redundant cooling products in their buildings due to REGULATION . This is due to ambient heat created from the server racks . Making the products that Vertiv and Modine sell ESSENTIAL to all data centers through the unforeseeable future . If data centers are being deployed they are getting there products from Vertiv Mod TT etc . Since Monday the stock is down roughly 14 % due to nothing_besides this Vera Rubin rack nonsense . Buy back in were going to $ 200 once people realize this . I believe their order backlog will continue to increase because of the reasons above ."

The site becomes Joby’s second facility in Ohio and its third overall, significantly expanding its U.S. manufacturing footprint alongside its 435,500 sq ft Marina, California plant. Management says the Ohio operations are intended to support production scaling to roughly four eVTOL aircraft per month by 2027, with longer-term capacity projected at up to \\~500 aircraft annually. For investors, this move highlights Joby’s transition from R&D toward capital-intensive manufacturing, with execution, certification timing, and demand visibility now becoming the key variables to watch.

Management says the Ohio operations are intended to support production scaling to roughly four eVTOL aircraft per month by 2027 with longerterm capacity projected at up to 500 aircraft annually . For investors this move highlights Joby ’ s transition from RD toward capitalintensive manufacturing with execution certification timing and demand visibility now becoming the key variables to watch ."

      "selftext": "Single family home REITS dropped by 5-10% across the board today after Trump made a comment about how institutional investors such as private equity shouldn't be allowed to buy existing Single family homes. INVH, in particular, is down 9%. Here's why this drop is an opportunity: 1. This hypothetical law, which Trump will need to convince congress to pass, would not even apply to Invitation homes, because they do not buy existing homes, they build new ones to rent out. But they got caught in the sell off and are down 9%. 2. If anything, this law puts Invitation homes at an advantage; competitors such as private equity firms can no longer buy existing homes to rent out. This limits the supply of single family homes available for rent, pushing rents up on their existing homes. On top of this, INVH can continue to build new homes to rent, at better margins now that rents are higher. 3. INVH is trading at an estimated 30-40% discount to the underlying value of its homes minus debts. So even in the extreme case where INVH is required to divest its holdings over a multi-year period, shareholders come out ahead. 4. If Institutional investors want exposure to single family homes, they won't be able to buy them directly anymore. As a result, there would be increased demand for existing REITs that already own properties. This would act as a technical factor favoring INVH.",

INVH in particular is down 9 % . Heres why this drop is an opportunity 1 . This hypothetical law which Trump will need to convince congress to pass would not_even apply to Invitation homes because they do not_buy existing homes they build new ones to rent out . But they got caught in the sell off and are down 9 % . 2 . If anything this law puts Invitation homes at an advantage competitors such as private equity firms can no_longer buy existing homes to rent out . This limits the supply of single family homes available for rent pushing rents up on their existing homes . On top of this INVH can continue to build new homes to rent at better margins now that rents are higher . 3 . INVH is trading at an estimated 3040 % discount to the underlying value of its homes minus debts . So even in the extreme case where INVH is required to divest its holdings over a multiyear period shareholders come out ahead . 4 . If Institutional investors want exposure to single family homes they wont be able to buy them directly anymore . As a result there would be increased demand for existing REITs that already own properties . This would act as a technical factor favoring INVH ."

      "selftext": "A company specializing in automotive supply chains made a strategic decision several years ago to heavily support American electric vehicles (primarily Ford and GM). However, both automakers subsequently cut their pure electric projects. In early 2025, this supply chain company initiated major layoffs. Fortunately, its non EV projects remain quite robust. Their primary semiconductor supplier is MU. In the latter half of the year, MU indicated price reductions for 2026, leading the company to be highly optimistic about profitability that year. However, in December, MU announced significant price hikes for all products except one minor adjustment! (MU's stock price has surged 47% since December). This company was swamped before Christmas in December, scrambling to revise budgets. The COO, who had previously assured the board of cost reductions for 2026, now had to explain costs surging 1.5 times. They also had to justify raising prices immediately after setting them with downstream clients like GM and Ford. The COO was stressed to the max. The only silver lining? Their employees immediately bought MU stock. New vehicles will definitely see price hikes in 2026, and the used car market is once again being driven by CVNA.",

      "selftext": "When I first started investing, I spent a lot of time overanalyzing small decisions. Every allocation tweak felt important, every market move needed an explanation. Over time, especially after living through a few volatile periods, I noticed that the biggest improvement didn’t come from better analysis, but from doing less. Simplifying the process, checking prices less often, and accepting that uncertainty is part of the game made investing feel calmer and more sustainable. I’m curious what helped others reach that point. Was it experience, a bad mistake, automation, or simply time in the market?",

      "title": "Capitulation Bottoms: How to Spot Explosive Reversals Before They Happen",
      "selftext": "Capitulation bottoms often signal the end of a sharp decline and the beginning of a powerful reversal. These setups are driven by extreme selling pressure followed by sudden demand, creating a high-probability opportunity for traders who can read the signs early. A typical capitulation involves a rapid, steep drop in price often fueled by panic selling where weak hands are flushed out. This is usually confirmed by a volume spike, showing that a large number of positions are being liquidated all at once. Price structure plays a critical role. Key levels like major support zones, trendline holds, or previous lows act as strong areas where buyers step in. Spotting a reaction at these levels can be the first sign of reversal. Risk management is essential tight stop-loss placement just below recent lows helps protect against further downside. For early entries, it’s wise to wait for a confirmation signal such as a strong bounce, bullish candlestick formation, or a reclaim of a key level before scaling in. Capitulation bottoms have a track record of marking major turning points in both stocks and crypto. For example, when a stock drops 15% in two days, hits a historical support level, and rebounds on heavy volume the next session that’s a strong case for a reversal trade. Reading these patterns right can position traders ahead of explosive moves.",

      "selftext_processed": "Capitulation bottoms often signal the end of a sharp decline and the beginning of a powerful reversal . These setups are driven by extreme selling pressure followed by sudden demand creating a highprobability opportunity for traders who can read the signs early . A typical capitulation involves a rapid steep drop in price often fueled by panic selling where weak hands are flushed out . This is usually confirmed by a volume spike showing that a large number of positions are being liquidated all at once . Price structure plays a critical role . Key levels like major support zones trendline holds or previous lows act as strong areas where buyers step in . Spotting a reaction at these levels can be the first sign of reversal . Risk management is essential tight stoploss placement just below recent lows helps protect against further downside . For early entries it ’ s wise to wait for a confirmation signal such as a strong bounce bullish candlestick formation or a reclaim of a key level before scaling in . Capitulation bottoms have a track record of marking major turning points in both stocks and crypto . For example when a stock drops 15 % in two days hits a historical support level and rebounds on heavy volume the next session that ’ s a strong case for a reversal trade . Reading these patterns right can position traders ahead of explosive moves ."

      "title": "GLP-1R Agonist due diligence (Novo Nordisk stock analysis)",
      "selftext": "Tried to post this on value investing but got removed, possiblity due to multiple previous posts about Novo Nordisk. Wanted to post my analysis for critique: For context I have previously just held index funds (S&P 500 & FTSE 100) but with growing fears (believable IMO) of an AI/ Tech bubble and the fact that the S&P 500 is currently 34.43% weighted to Tech I wanted to look at diversifying away from that with some defensive stock picks. My professional background is healthcare so seems a reasonable place to start. Firstly I would say the safe bet is that GLP-1 agonists and similar drugs are going to be a mainstay of pharamacetutical sales over the next 10 years and probably further into the future. They have shown themselves already to be a silver bullet for weight loss & obesity which is a plague of the western word. Furthermore there is good evidence to suggest they are powerful at reducing obesity related diseases with hard endpoints (morbidity and mortality) like diabetes and heart disease etc. On top of this they do this with what seems to be an acceptably rare side effect profile (notably there are cases of severe pancreatitis which is life threatening). I'm not sure if many would disagree with this first point. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly as you probably know are the only two companies to have GLP-1 Receptor agonists on the market and both have other drugs in pipeline. Other key companies with drugs in pipeline include Roche, Amgen and Pfizer which aquired one with Metsera. The horizon includes the oral version of Novo's existing drug semaglutide which just got FDA approval and a new small molecule drug from Lilly; Orforglipron which should be noted for the fact that it will probably be cheaper to produce than Novo's large molecule oral semaglutide. Lilly also has a triple agonist (retatrutide) which hits two other key receptors with a differing affinity profile which seemed to be quite effective based on their dose escalation phase II trials with phase III trials ongoing. Novo has a dual and a triple agonist also in the pipeline at Phase II. So as alot of people have alluded to Novo's share price has plummeted from an all time high in the last year with the accepted narrative being that Lilly has eaten its lunch by being able to rapidly take market share through faster manufacturing with what seems to be a slighlty more effective drug (Tirzepatide / Mounjaro). I don't have a background in finance or stock analysis but I have tried to compare these GLP-1Ra related companies using key value investing ratios for the last financial year below. I have avoided using any forward looking metrics (like PEG or projected EPS) because in my inexperieced view that is just relying on someone elses prediction about what will happen and why would they know? I've just focused on whether the business is well run and has good fundamentals. |**Stock**|**Roche**|**Amgen**|**Pfizer**|**Eli Lilly**|**Novo Nordisk**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Price in USD**|$422.11|$340.55|$25.66|$1,107.89|$57.11| |**Current Price before conversion**|336.40|340.55|$25.66|1,107.89|365.25| |**Market Cap ($)**|342.2B|184.4B|146.5B|1055.0B|253.6B| |**P/E**|28.68|26.37|14.91|54.04|15.6| |**EPS**|11.75|12.94|1.72|20.45|23.33| |**EV/EBITDA**|13.02|13.53|7.83|34.29|10.10| |**Debt / Equity**|1.05|5.67|0.67|1.79|0.60| |**ROIC**|18.54%|10.56%|7.04%|29.95%|42.81%| Not only does Novo have a much better P/E ratio compared to competitors it also has higher earnings per share, better value to earnings ratio, better debt to equity ratio. Finally the return on invested capital is significantly higher and has been high for years. Essentially this business is highly efficient at turning invested capital into returns. So this just means the business is well run and has good financials. But surely theres a risk that Eli Lilly will just dominate the market with better drugs? That is definetely a possibility, especially with the potentially cheaper Orforglipron, but I would argue the obesity market is so large and is likely to get even larger as developing countries become richer. So much so that there will be a large enough market for Novo to still sell plenty of their drugs even if they are number 2 behind Lilly, and hopefully derive growth and value over the long term. Essentially it doesn't need to be see as a 'winner takes all situation' with such a large market. The problem with Lilly is the current price. Just compare those same metrics with a whopping PE of 54.04. It otherwise seems like a reasonably well run company with good prospects pipeline wise. And yes there are other risks for Novo, the standard pharma risks of drugs not working as intended, or intolerable side effects, but this isn't a new class of drugs so hopefully those risks are minimised. On the plus side Novo does have other (smaller) facets to its business including insulin and rare disease medicines so this does slightly reduce the downside risk if they gut hammered in the GLP-1 Market. I will probably end up buying a bundle of 3 of these companies (including Lilly and maybe Roche) but weight it towards Novo. I'm not posting this all so you can agree with me, I'm hoping for (hopefully) insightful critiques. What am I not considering?",

Wanted to post my analysis for critique For context I have previously just held index funds SP 500 FTSE 100 but with growing fears believable IMO of an AI Tech bubble and the fact that the SP 500 is currently 34.43 % weighted to Tech I wanted to look at diversifying away from that with some defensive stock picks . My professional background is healthcare so seems a reasonable place to start . Firstly I would say the safe bet is that GLP1 agonists and similar drugs are going to be a mainstay of pharamacetutical sales over the next 10 years and probably further into the future . They have shown themselves already to be a silver bullet for weight loss obesity which is a plague of the western word . Furthermore there is good evidence to suggest they are powerful at reducing obesity related diseases with hard endpoints morbidity and mortality like diabetes and heart disease etc . On top of this they do this with what seems to be an acceptably rare side effect profile notably there are cases of severe pancreatitis which is life threatening . Im not_sure if many would disagree with this first point . Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly as you probably know are the only two companies to have GLP1 Receptor agonists on the market and both have other drugs in pipeline . Other key companies with drugs in pipeline include Roche Amgen and Pfizer which aquired one with Metsera . The horizon includes the oral version of Novos existing drug semaglutide which just got FDA approval and a new small molecule drug from Lilly Orforglipron which should be noted for the fact that it will probably be cheaper to produce than Novos large molecule oral semaglutide . Lilly also has a triple agonist retatrutide which hits two other key receptors with a differing affinity profile which seemed to be quite effective based on their dose escalation phase II trials with phase III trials ongoing . Novo has a dual and a triple agonist also in the pipeline at Phase II . So as alot of people have alluded to Novos share price has plummeted from an all time high in the last year with the accepted narrative being that Lilly has eaten its lunch by being able to rapidly take market share through faster manufacturing with what seems to be a slighlty more effective drug Tirzepatide Mounjaro . I dont have a background in finance or stock analysis but I have tried to compare these GLP1Ra related companies using key value investing ratios for the last financial year below . I have avoided using any forward looking metrics like PEG or projected EPS because in my inexperieced view that is just relying on someone elses prediction about what will happen and why would they know Ive just focused on whether the business is well run and has good fundamentals . StockRocheAmgenPfizerEli LillyNovo Nordisk Price in USD $ 422.11 $ 340.55 $ 25.66 $ 1107.89 $ 57.11 Current Price before conversion336.40340.55 $ 25.661107.89365.25 Market Cap $ 342.2B184.4B146.5B1055.0B253.6B PE28.6826.3714.9154.0415.6 EPS11.7512.941.7220.4523.33 EVEBITDA13.0213.537.8334.2910.10 Debt Equity1.055.670.671.790.60 ROIC18.54 % 10.56 % 7.04 % 29.95 % 42.81 % Not_only does Novo have a much better PE ratio compared to competitors it also has higher earnings per share better value to earnings ratio better debt to equity ratio . Finally the return on invested capital is significantly higher and has been high for years . Essentially this business is highly efficient at turning invested capital into returns . So this just means the business is well run and has good financials . But surely theres a risk that Eli Lilly will just dominate the market with better drugs That is definetely a possibility especially with the potentially cheaper Orforglipron but I would argue the obesity market is so large and is likely to get even larger as developing countries become richer . So much so that there will be a large enough market for Novo to still sell plenty of their drugs even if they are number 2 behind Lilly and hopefully derive growth and value over the long term . Essentially it doesnt need to be see as a winner takes all situation with such a large market . The problem with Lilly is the current price . Just compare those same metrics with a whopping PE of 54.04 . It otherwise seems like a reasonably well run company with good prospects pipeline wise . And yes there are other risks for Novo the standard pharma risks of drugs not_working as intended or intolerable side effects but this isnt a new class of drugs so hopefully those risks are minimised . On the plus side Novo does have other smaller facets to its business including insulin and rare disease medicines so this does slightly reduce the downside risk if they gut hammered in the GLP1 Market . I will probably end up buying a bundle of 3 of these companies including Lilly and maybe Roche but weight it towards Novo . Im not_posting this all so you can agree with me Im hoping for hopefully insightful critiques . What am I not_considering"

JP Morgan backs governments major institutions and other banks it literally can not afford to ever really disappear it is backed by states JP consistently posts strong growth figures Good stuff aside it fell more than the SP during 2008 Crisis and Covid but also recovered better The real key point is the second one . Is JP Morgan the perfect ideal investment as well as an investment in Gold as in boom it does super well consistently and is well supported in bust use the increase in Gold price to buy more of the JP lmao"

      "selftext": "Oklo announced today that it has signed a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to support the design, construction, and operation of a radioisotope pilot plant (“Radioisotope Pilot Facility”) under the DOE Reactor Pilot Program (RPP). Signing the OTA is a major milestone which marks the transition from project selection and planning into active execution under DOE authorization. “This OTA establishes a framework for execution and risk reduction. By building and operating a pilot reactor, we generate the data and experience to streamline future commercial deployments, improve regulatory efficiency, and deliver long-term value,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo. Atomic Alchemy Inc., an Oklo subsidiary, is using the Radioisotope Pilot Facility to lay the groundwork for future commercial plants that make medical and research radioisotopes in the United States. These radioisotopes are essential for diagnosing cancer, treating disease, powering medical research, and supporting national security. Today, many are produced overseas or in aging facilities. By first operating a pilot plant, Oklo can then scale into reliable, domestic production that helps ensure hospitals, researchers, and patients have consistent access to these lifesaving materials. With the OTA now in place, Atomic Alchemy will focus its near-term resources on building the Radioisotope Pilot Facility under DOE authorization. As part of this learn-first-then-scale strategy, Atomic Alchemy has withdrawn its previously submitted Nuclear Regulatory Commission construction permit application for the Meitner-1 commercial radioisotope production facility at Idaho National Laboratory to focus on the Radioisotope Pilot Facility. Oklo views the RPP as an enabler and accelerator to deliver advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen U.S. energy security, healthcare infrastructure, and industrial leadership.",

Signing the OTA is a major milestone which marks the transition from project selection and planning into active execution under DOE authorization . “ This OTA establishes a framework for execution and risk reduction . By building and operating a pilot reactor we generate the data and experience to streamline future commercial deployments improve regulatory efficiency and deliver longterm value ” said Jacob DeWitte cofounder and CEO of Oklo . Atomic Alchemy Inc. an Oklo subsidiary is using the Radioisotope Pilot Facility to lay the groundwork for future commercial plants that make medical and research radioisotopes in the United States . These radioisotopes are essential for diagnosing cancer treating disease powering medical research and supporting national security . Today many are produced overseas or in aging facilities . By first operating a pilot plant Oklo can then scale into reliable domestic production that helps ensure hospitals researchers and patients have consistent access to these lifesaving materials . With the OTA now in place Atomic Alchemy will focus its nearterm resources on building the Radioisotope Pilot Facility under DOE authorization . As part of this learnfirstthenscale strategy Atomic Alchemy has withdrawn its previously submitted Nuclear Regulatory Commission construction permit application for the Meitner1 commercial radioisotope production facility at Idaho National Laboratory to focus on the Radioisotope Pilot Facility . Oklo views the RPP as an enabler and accelerator to deliver advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen U.S. energy security healthcare infrastructure and industrial leadership ."

I know we can’t predict the market, so I think I want to adjust my investing strategy. To start, I max out my Roth every year and am 80% invested in QQQ/SPY. I will continue to do that, and I will keep everything there. It’s currently about 30% of total my stock assets. I have about 25 stocks in my active portfolio. Mostly tech. I started investing in 2019 and am currently up 130% all time. So, I want to narrow it down to a selection of stocks that I have the strongest conviction in. (to lock in profits and use for a potential down payment on a house if there is a crash) Selling out of: FANNG, and most blue chip tech stocks like ISRG, TSM, CRWD, etc. (selling about 2/3 of all active portfolio) Keeping: MSFT, MELI, NNOX, PL, SOFI, COST, JMIA I want to keep those ones because either a) they’re my babies and have strong conviction b) moonshot potential c) confidence during recession. Then I want to take the proceeds and invest in a high yield, secure ETF/alternative income asset like HYG until I find a house to buy. Sound reasonable? I’d love feedback",

I know we can ’ t predict the market so I think I want to adjust my investing strategy . To start I max out my Roth every year and am 80 % invested in QQQSPY . I will continue to do that and I will keep everything there . It ’ s currently about 30 % of total my stock assets . I have about 25 stocks in my active portfolio . Mostly tech . I started investing in 2019 and am currently up 130 % all time . So I want to narrow it down to a selection of stocks that I have the strongest conviction in . to lock in profits and use for a potential down payment on a house if there is a crash Selling out of FANNG and most blue chip tech stocks like ISRG TSM CRWD etc . selling about 23 of all active portfolio Keeping MSFT MELI NNOX PL SOFI COST JMIA I want to keep those ones because either a they ’ re my babies and have strong conviction b moonshot potential c confidence during recession . Then I want to take the proceeds and invest in a high yield secure ETFalternative income asset like HYG until I find a house to buy . Sound reasonable I ’ d love feedback"

Buffett, who retired last year, famously took an annual salary of $100,000 with no bonus or stock awards for over 40 years. Bloomberg estimates his net worth at $150 billion, the tenth-richest person in the world. Abel, who was previously Buffett's deputy, was paid $21 million last year. CEOs of S&P 500 companies were paid an average of $18.9 million in 2024. I believe he will maintain the company's investment philosophy even though he is known for having a more hands-on leadership style than Buffett.",

Buffett who retired last year famously took an annual salary of $ 100000 with no_bonus or stock awards for over 40 years . Bloomberg estimates his net worth at $ 150 billion the tenthrichest person in the world . Abel who was previously Buffetts deputy was paid $ 21 million last year . CEOs of SP 500 companies were paid an average of $ 18.9 million in 2024 . I believe he will maintain the companys investment philosophy even though he is known for having a more handson leadership style than Buffett ."

      "title": "hedging the impending AI doom bubble",
      "selftext": "I am not here to debate the bubbliness of it all, or the merits or demerits of AI and all that, or the timeline on which it will collapse. my original bet (made in late 2023) was buying NVDIA, Snap, and Palantir puts that will expire worthless in two weeks unless I spend more to roll them. which I will not, so this is obviously not financial advice, as I am not qualified to give it. and my timing sucked. io am however, hedging in other ways. I just want to share thoughts on how I am hedging for what I think is going to be an AI bubble burst. again, this is not financial advice, I am a monkey randomly hitting buttons here, and will soon resort to avian augury to divine my path through the market. anyways. generally, I think tech and anything AI especially are in a bubble right now. their market value keeps going up, and their use generally is staying the same, if not optically decreasing- to that last point, more are more people are starting to see what is and what is not vaporware in the ai space now, and understand the limitations and value proposition of ai than they did a few years ago when this all started. AI has uses, but when I say AI in terms of the bubble and industry, I am talking about generative AI. I think that AI is one of the tools of the future, just not the pure generative kind. machine learning, and other forms of AI that we have been developing for a long time are, I think, where the long term bet is at vis a vis AI as a stable market force rather than AI the generative AI industry. to that end, I do have positions in TSMC, as I believe that regardless of where the tech industry goes, they, other fabs, and the people who supply them will be the ultimate winners of this bubble, and they who will lose the least when the dust settles. Venezuela does put a slight damper in my \"the US wouldn't be that impatient, and china is way too patient, right?\" mantra about Taiwan and TSMC, but I'm convinced Venezuela is an oil play, and the orange man hates anything to do with computers or people who he can't bully. politics aside, I think that companies like NVDIA and AMD will still be businesses after the dust settles, as long as NVDIA isn't doing an ENRON, but I just dont see their moat as impenetrable. and even if it is, is it protecting as big a hoard as they thing? we saw with deepseek that there are efficiency improvements to be found, which could seriously cut into NVDIA's bottom line. it is only a matter of time until the market has to reckon with the fact that generative AI just does not do what we want it to do. it is not worth trillions of dollars at the moment in terms of return on investment. days, months, years, I'm not sure, but here are the things I think that are actually making the world a different, better place, and will change the world. basically, good things to invest in, for better, or for worse, that are not AI. Geospatial tech. I think things like LIDAR, improved GIS networks, long range networks and network access are going to become huge. they already are, but they represent incredible breakthroughs in how we understand the world, and how we interact with it. also huge for how companies provide services BIOMED- Crispr and mRNA (and similar) vaccines and therapies, and the combination therein. right now the main thing holding these incredible technologies back from being something super commonplace in medicine is 1. no real regulation on using it on embryos and fetuses, or about engineering embryos (there is a ban, but at some point, we will have to address the reality of the probability of use while trying to figure out what is medicine and what is eugenics- quite the sticky wicket, wouldn't you say, since it could both very rapidly add to or detract from human genetic diversity in ways that are impossible to predict, except that they have the potential to alter the evolutionary course of Homo sapiens and everything else on this planet) 2. the process of using it now, though effective, is brutal, and limited I think that the recent sickle cell cure requires someone with sickle cell anemia to undergo bone marrow removal, chemo and radiation, and then the marrow is replaced? I dont know, but it sounds like something not everyone will be able to undergo yet, unfortunately. 3. its so expensive. so so so expensive. millions of dollars for individualized treatment expensive. insurance may or may not cover it expensive. 4. the political climate in many of the wealthiest developed nations vis a vis vaccines and biomedical breakthroughs is not favorable. it is setting us back years or decades from cures. chips and batteries- I dont know about large scale 50000k a pop chips but more and more computer chips are going in more and more things. I mean lego just chipped the brick. so my guess is more chips, and eventually, AI integration into things that people actually want to/like to use en masse. that means more battery life being used by the average device. even with battery breakthroughs, it will be decades before the lithium battery in some form is replaced just because the infrastructure is so large, and the demand is so rapidly growing. who knows whether we will all be using iPhones, androids, or whatever the next trend in phone or computer or electronic is, but it will likely use batteries, and it will likely use chips. If NVIDIA goes the way of Enron, I think tsmc will still have a waitlist. hemp and marijuana- I have both optimistic and cynical reasons for these picks. plenty of etfs around for cheap that have invested in OTC or private enterprises that are harder to invest in but profitable if things become legal and/or more widely adopted in the western world. I think marijuana legalization would be a very bread and circuses move for a certain western leader or two, and I think hemp has real potential in a resurgence for use in building materials and fiber applications, among other things. I think that it is inevitable, given the economics of hemp (even big corporations at some point will have to admit using a weed for a lot of things is cheap, someone will figure out the gummed up machinery thing soon I imagine (interchangeable milling and harvesting heads? but I digress) and I am very slowly investing with the hope that inevitability comes relatively soon. that is more of a Hail Mary, and totally at the mercy of political winds. china- I'm not here to debate china's ascendence to the world stage as one of the top superpowers. its been around a long time, it will be around a long time, and I kinda believe that. I think that they are a stability hedge with growth potential. not to be stereotypical, but china is ahead of the western world in almost every metric that seems important to a healthy future as a nation besides their political system (which is honestly the most democratic its maybe ever been in its long history, though this is mostly concerning problems of allegations of forced labor and some real systemic xenophobia?as an American, I shall not throw stones at glass houses) and I believe that their economy is set up for success, in that I believe that economies in a capitalistic world economy are only as successful as both the gross amount of resource that they exploit, and the rate at which they exploit it. china has an incredible amount of natural and human resource to exploit, and are rapidly increasing their capacity to exploit it in the long term via education and research, renewable energy initiatives, and policies meant to support the environment. I make no ethical judgement there, some is good, some is bad, again as an American, can't speak to that one (we have national parks. we also created the conditions for them to burn to ashes uncontrollably, with the best of intentions). anyways, I think china's industry and economy in general is something I want to invest in, trying to stay away from companies that even have a whiff of slave labor about them. things I'm not investing in AI Social media, though reddit as a pick and shovel play for ai is interesting to me precious metals: I have in the past, seems to popular these days again. the stability was in the relative unpopularity vs. fiat crypto: dont get me started. things I should be investing in: land myself <3 would love to hear everyone's thoughts. again, no financial advice here, just me musing out loud, we are all a Boltzmann brain floating in space....",

      "selftext_processed": "I am not_here to debate the bubbliness of it all or the merits or demerits of AI and all that or the timeline on which it will collapse . my original bet made in late 2023 was buying NVDIA Snap and Palantir puts that will expire worthless in two weeks unless I spend more to roll them . which I will not_so this is obviously not_financial advice as I am not_qualified to give it . and my timing sucked . io am however hedging in other ways . I just want to share thoughts on how I am hedging for what I think is going to be an AI bubble burst . again this is not_financial advice I am a monkey randomly hitting buttons here and will soon resort to avian augury to divine my path through the market . anyways . generally I think tech and anything AI especially are in a bubble right now . their market value keeps going up and their use generally is staying the same if not_optically decreasing to that last point more are more people are starting to see what is and what is not_vaporware in the ai space now and understand the limitations and value proposition of ai than they did a few years ago when this all started . AI has uses but when I say AI in terms of the bubble and industry I am talking about generative AI . I think that AI is one of the tools of the future just not_the pure generative kind . machine learning and other forms of AI that we have been developing for a long time are I think where the long term bet is at vis a vis AI as a stable market force rather than AI the generative AI industry . to that end I do have positions in TSMC as I believe that regardless of where the tech industry goes they other fabs and the people who supply them will be the ultimate winners of this bubble and they who will lose the least when the dust settles . Venezuela does put a slight damper in my the US wouldnt be that impatient and china is way too patient right mantra about Taiwan and TSMC but Im convinced Venezuela is an oil play and the orange man hates anything to do with computers or people who he cant bully . politics aside I think that companies like NVDIA and AMD will still be businesses after the dust settles as long as NVDIA isnt doing an ENRON but I just dont see their moat as impenetrable . and even if it is is it protecting as big a hoard as they thing we saw with deepseek that there are efficiency improvements to be found which could seriously cut into NVDIAs bottom line . it is only a matter of time until the market has to reckon with the fact that generative AI just does not_do what we want it to do . it is not_worth trillions of dollars at the moment in terms of return on investment . days months years Im not_sure but here are the things I think that are actually making the world a different better place and will change the world . basically good things to invest in for better or for worse that are not_AI . Geospatial tech . I think things like LIDAR improved GIS networks long range networks and network access are going to become huge . they already are but they represent incredible breakthroughs in how we understand the world and how we interact with it . also huge for how companies provide services BIOMED Crispr and mRNA and similar vaccines and therapies and the combination therein . right now the main thing holding these incredible technologies back from being something super commonplace in medicine is 1. no_real regulation on using it on embryos and fetuses or about engineering embryos there is a ban but at some point we will have to address the reality of the probability of use while trying to figure out what is medicine and what is eugenics quite the sticky wicket wouldnt you say since it could both very rapidly add to or detract from human genetic diversity in ways that are impossible to predict except that they have the potential to alter the evolutionary course of Homo sapiens and everything else on this planet 2. the process of using it now though effective is brutal and limited I think that the recent sickle cell cure requires someone with sickle cell anemia to undergo bone marrow removal chemo and radiation and then the marrow is replaced I dont know but it sounds like something not_everyone will be able to undergo yet unfortunately . 3. its so expensive . so so so expensive . millions of dollars for individualized treatment expensive . insurance may or may not_cover it expensive . 4. the political climate in many of the wealthiest developed nations vis a vis vaccines and biomedical breakthroughs is not_favorable . it is setting us back years or decades from cures . chips and batteries I dont know about large scale 50000k a pop chips but more and more computer chips are going in more and more things . I mean lego just chipped the brick . so my guess is more chips and eventually AI integration into things that people actually want tolike to use en masse . that means more battery life being used by the average device . even with battery breakthroughs it will be decades before the lithium battery in some form is replaced just because the infrastructure is so large and the demand is so rapidly growing . who knows whether we will all be using iPhones androids or whatever the next trend in phone or computer or electronic is but it will likely use batteries and it will likely use chips . If NVIDIA goes the way of Enron I think tsmc will still have a waitlist . hemp and marijuana I have both optimistic and cynical reasons for these picks . plenty of etfs around for cheap that have invested in OTC or private enterprises that are harder to invest in but profitable if things become legal andor more widely adopted in the western world . I think marijuana legalization would be a very bread and circuses move for a certain western leader or two and I think hemp has real potential in a resurgence for use in building materials and fiber applications among other things . I think that it is inevitable given the economics of hemp even big corporations at some point will have to admit using a weed for a lot of things is cheap someone will figure out the gummed up machinery thing soon I imagine interchangeable milling and harvesting heads but I digress and I am very slowly investing with the hope that inevitability comes relatively soon . that is more of a Hail Mary and totally at the mercy of political winds . china Im not_here to debate chinas ascendence to the world stage as one of the top superpowers . its been around a long time it will be around a long time and I kinda believe that . I think that they are a stability hedge with growth potential . not_to be stereotypical but china is ahead of the western world in almost every metric that seems important to a healthy future as a nation besides their political system which is honestly the most democratic its maybe ever been in its long history though this is mostly concerning problems of allegations of forced labor and some real systemic xenophobiaas an American I shall not_throw stones at glass houses and I believe that their economy is set up for success in that I believe that economies in a capitalistic world economy are only as successful as both the gross amount of resource that they exploit and the rate at which they exploit it . china has an incredible amount of natural and human resource to exploit and are rapidly increasing their capacity to exploit it in the long term via education and research renewable energy initiatives and policies meant to support the environment . I make no_ethical judgement there some is good some is bad again as an American cant speak to that one we have national parks . we also created the conditions for them to burn to ashes uncontrollably with the best of intentions . anyways I think chinas industry and economy in general is something I want to invest in trying to stay away from companies that even have a whiff of slave labor about them . things Im not_investing in AI Social media though reddit as a pick and shovel play for ai is interesting to me precious metals I have in the past seems to popular these days again . the stability was in the relative unpopularity vs. fiat crypto dont get me started . things I should be investing in land myself 3 would love to hear everyones thoughts . again no_financial advice here just me musing out loud we are all a Boltzmann brain floating in space ...."

      "selftext": "A lot of investing discussions focus on finding the “right stock,” but over time I’ve found that long-term results depend more on process than picks. Here are a few principles that seem to matter most: 1) Asset allocation > stock selection How you divide money between equities, bonds, and regions often explains more of your results than individual picks. 2) Compounding beats timing Missing strong market years usually hurts more than avoiding downturns helps. 3) Risk management protects returns Over-leverage, concentration, and emotional decisions can undo years of gains. 4) Behavior > strategy Even good strategies fail if investors panic, chase trends, or abandon plans. 5) Valuation matters long term Buying great businesses at unreasonable prices often leads to mediocre returns.",

Here are a few principles that seem to matter most 1 Asset allocation stock selection How you divide money between equities bonds and regions often explains more of your results than individual picks . 2 Compounding beats timing Missing strong market years usually hurts more than avoiding downturns helps . 3 Risk management protects returns Overleverage concentration and emotional decisions can undo years of gains . 4 Behavior strategy Even good strategies fail if investors panic chase trends or abandon plans . 5 Valuation matters long term Buying great businesses at unreasonable prices often leads to mediocre returns ."

      "selftext": "While many investors focus on Venezuela’s oil and gas sector as the most obvious play on the country’s reopening, digital economy leaders like MercadoLibre ($MELI) and Nubank ($NU) represent a more discreet but potentially powerful opportunity. Venezuela’s large population, high mobile penetration, and historically underdeveloped e‑commerce and financial infrastructure mean that companies with proven digital ecosystems in Latin America could capture outsized growth if economic and political conditions normalize. MercadoLibre, with its dominant marketplace and fintech platform Mercado Pago, is uniquely positioned to introduce online commerce and digital payments to a largely untapped market, offering a growth avenue that isn’t immediately obvious to traditional commodity-focused investors. Similarly, Nubank’s technology-driven banking model could quietly unlock value in Venezuela by serving an underbanked population. Unlike conventional banks, Nubank has experience scaling rapidly across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, offering low-cost, accessible financial products to millions. If Venezuelan financial markets open and consumers increasingly adopt digital banking solutions, Nubank could expand seamlessly, taking advantage of infrastructure gaps that legacy banks are slow to address. This potential remains under the radar compared with the headline-grabbing oil and gas plays. Both MercadoLibre and Nubank are essentially positioned to benefit from structural trends in Latin America, digital adoption, e‑commerce expansion, and financial inclusion, without relying on oil prices or resource exports. For investors seeking opportunities beyond the obvious energy sector, these digital leaders offer a stealthy way to capture the economic upside of Venezuela’s gradual reintegration into regional trade and finance, potentially generating outsized returns if the market begins to normalize.",

      "selftext": "There was a post here a few weeks ago of the Google insider who predicted the day that Gemini 3 would drop and all of Google’s search trends. They were right. On its own, that's nothing magical, but, they also predicted dozens of other markets correctly that could only be known using insider information. For example: * \\#1 most searched movie on Google (8 cents -> 100 cents) * Gemini Flash not released by December 15 (23 cents -> 100 cents) * \\#1 most searched athlete (35 cents to 100 cents) * \\#2 most searched person (21 cents to 100 cents) There’s only one explanation, they are a Google employee making bank off insider information. And it just so happens, a few days ago, the same account is back putting money on Gemini getting *at least* a 50% score on FrontierMath’s Benchmark. So… that’s all cool and shit but how do I profit? Well let me explain it for you simpletons: I'm loading up on GOOG calls at open, AI is \\*\\*\\*the\\*\\*\\* market cap driver right now, and with the Gemini 3.0 release, everyone knows Google is slightly ahea But, if Gemini can score 70%+ on FrontierMath? That's a whole other ball game. That takes AI from helpful chat assistant to potentially publishing papers. his is a huge deal if this insider is right. They singlehandedly moved the odds from 8 cents to 45 cents. Conviction is balls deep and everyone knows they know something. Even if they're wrong, Google is mopping the floor with everyone else, it's not even a competition. I'll have to roll my calls over to LEAPs if they don't hit in the next month. Long live Google, death to NVDA, and thank you Google insider for the free loot. Insider profile: polymarket user @ beepboopzyx",

On its own thats nothing_magical but they also predicted dozens of other markets correctly that could only be known using insider information . For example 1 most searched movie on Google 8 cents 100 cents Gemini Flash not_released by December 15 23 cents 100 cents 1 most searched athlete 35 cents to 100 cents 2 most searched person 21 cents to 100 cents There ’ s only one explanation they are a Google employee making bank off insider information . And it just so happens a few days ago the same account is back putting money on Gemini getting at least a 50 % score on FrontierMath ’ s Benchmark . So… that ’ s all cool and shit but how do I profit Well let me explain it for you simpletons Im loading up on GOOG calls at open AI is the market cap driver right now and with the Gemini 3.0 release everyone knows Google is slightly ahea But if Gemini can score 70 % on FrontierMath Thats a whole other ball game . That takes AI from helpful chat assistant to potentially publishing papers . his is a huge deal if this insider is right . They singlehandedly moved the odds from 8 cents to 45 cents . Conviction is balls deep and everyone knows they know something . Even if theyre wrong Google is mopping the floor with everyone else its not_even a competition . Ill have to roll my calls over to LEAPs if they dont hit in the next month . Long live Google death to NVDA and thank you Google insider for the free loot .

Long SOFI, although Goldman Sachs lowered the target price from $27 to $24, they are maintaining a neutral rating indicating that they will not be offloading SOFI from their portfolios, which can be viewed as a positive for long term investors. On the other hand, Barclays increased target price from $24 to $28. At this point SOFI remains a top choice among retail investors to join the S&P 500. Q4 earnings are set to post on January 30^(th), expected revenue of $985.4 million and profit of $0.12 per share. Q3 revenue of $950 million beat analysts’ previous estimates of $895 million. So far this year, SOFI has risen 72%. Predicted high for this year is $38, with a low of $12. I’m looking for a entry point around $26.90, which after today’s offloading might not be a bad spot as I don't believe price per share will decrease after earnings on January 30th, thoughts?",

But these refineries have been operating at low capacity usage for many years... Heard they were made due to a concern that traditional US light oil production was declining (like Texas) Given the current context, with the increase in heavy crude and these refineries, I’m trying to understand which publicly traded companies would be interesting to own and benefit from this capacity for the **long term**? Going past Venezuela... From what I could find, names that seem to have heavy investments in the Gulf are Valero, Marathon, ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, PBF, and Motiva (Aramco). Is this it ? I don't know much about the sector Also, I’m generally not into stock picking. I tend to prefer ETFs",

But these refineries have been operating at low capacity usage for many years ... Heard they were made due to a concern that traditional US light oil production was declining like Texas Given the current context with the increase in heavy crude and these refineries I ’ m trying to understand which publicly traded companies would be interesting to own and benefit from this capacity for the long term Going past Venezuela ... From what I could find names that seem to have heavy investments in the Gulf are Valero Marathon ExxonMobil Chevron BP PBF and Motiva Aramco . Is this it I dont know much about the sector Also I ’ m generally not_into stock picking . I tend to prefer ETFs"

Huang’s comments at CES “suggest that demand for NAND storage will remain robust across Nvidia systems,” he said. >Memory prices have been steadily climbing.

      "selftext": "The hands on test reveals Nvidia’s AI powered Drive platform is impressive. Nvidia’s Drive platform emphasizes predictability, safety, and modularity, contrasting Tesla’s more aggressive, end to end neural network approach. It’s designed for automakers and fleet operators, not direct to consumer use like Tesla FSD. For this reason, I disagree with the assertion within the article’s title at this time. The Verge’s test ride in a prototype vehicle showed smooth lane changes and merges, cautious behavior at intersections, and strong handling of complex urban scenarios. Nvidia’s platform runs on its Drive Thor chip, a next-gen AI processor designed for autonomous workloads. The system uses sensor fusion, combining lidar, radar, and cameras, for redundancy and reliability, unlike Tesla’s camera only approach. Nvidia is not building its own car but aims to power other automakers’ autonomous systems. Partners include Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Hyundai, who are integrating Nvidia’s tech into upcoming models.

      "title": "Compart may NOT be a bargain",
      "selftext": "First, let me say, I’m a nobody in the stock trading world. I have however been in the automotive industry my whole life. I keep seeing people suggesting Copart as a good buy due to its low share price of late. Well, I’d like to share an observation that I’m not sure people are aware of. Copart is primarily a salvage auction. They charge high fees for insurance companies to sell their salvage vehicles, as well as other corporate sellers, such as charity donations, some fleet vehicles, and on occasion some dealers. But the vast majority of their sales are cars that are fully written off due to serve damage. I’m going to lay out a few reasons Copart is facing some strong headwinds going forward and why the share price may not be the bargain people think it is. In 2013-2022 there was a good business to be made from buying wrecked cars and rebuilding them. Used car prices were high, inventory of good used cars was low and thus there was a significant margin to be made by buying wrecks to rebuild. You could buy a wreck for 25% of it’s retail value, put 40 hours and some capital into repairing it and still have a good car for 50% of the value of a similar used vehicle. That’s not true anymore. The margins are gone and the tech going forward will continue to make this more and more difficult. That’s another major issue. The tech in cars hadn’t quite reached the levels we see today. Parts interchangeability was a lot easier. Today, many salvage parts are more difficult to interchange due to the need for dealer authorized software reprogramming. This not only makes wrecks increasingly more difficult on late model cars, but shrinks the salvage industries market share for good used parts to be sold to independent repair shops. Overall, as these tech laden late model cars age, they’re seeing higher depreciation than ever and lower margins for salvage companies to break them apart for their components. There’s still money to be made breaking cars apart, but there’s not nearly as much profit in a wrecked vehicle that there was in the past. Repair costs also continue to climb as parts, supplies and especially skilled labor increases. The number of people able to do this kind of work is decreasing rapidly. People also don’t seem as interested in taking the risks to buy wrecks to rebuild themselves. Especially as used car prices fall. It’s becoming much more attractive to buy in-wrecked cars with minor mechanical issues and deferred maintenance than to undergo a complete rebuild of a totaled vehicle. With used car depreciation and a surplus of used inventory sitting on lots, cars are starting to sell wholesale for prices that make them much more attractive. If you look at the bid no sale prices mounting up at auction houses like IAA, and Adesa, you begin to see the reckoning Copart is up against. Why buy a wrecked car that will come with a branded title and a lower resale value along with an increased risk of needing repair (much of which you won’t know till you dig into the project) when you can buy a clean, in-wrecked car from a dealer trade in at a lower delta than ever. The truth is, there are more good reliable, well cared for cars at auction right now than there are people with the means to buy them. Lastly many cars that used to go through Copart auctions were bought by foreign buyers. Since the start of the trade war, tariffs have greatly affected the profitability of many exporters trying to buy cars from the US. Trade relations have a big effect on Copart sales and the values of salvage cars. There’s great risk to Copart from the standpoint of globalization failing and the US pulling back on global trade relations. Just be mindful of these issues if you are looking at Copart as a cheap company. There’s good reason that their market cap is declining.",

      "selftext_processed": "First let me say I ’ m a nobody_in the stock trading world . I have however been in the automotive industry my whole life . I keep seeing people suggesting Copart as a good buy due to its low share price of late . Well I ’ d like to share an observation that I ’ m not_sure people are aware of . Copart is primarily a salvage auction . They charge high fees for insurance companies to sell their salvage vehicles as well as other corporate sellers such as charity donations some fleet vehicles and on occasion some dealers . But the vast majority of their sales are cars that are fully written off due to serve damage . I ’ m going to lay out a few reasons Copart is facing some strong headwinds going forward and why the share price may not_be the bargain people think it is . In 20132022 there was a good business to be made from buying wrecked cars and rebuilding them . Used car prices were high inventory of good used cars was low and thus there was a significant margin to be made by buying wrecks to rebuild . You could buy a wreck for 25 % of it ’ s retail value put 40 hours and some capital into repairing it and still have a good car for 50 % of the value of a similar used vehicle . That ’ s not_true anymore . The margins are gone and the tech going forward will continue to make this more and more difficult . That ’ s another major issue . The tech in cars hadn ’ t quite reached the levels we see today . Parts interchangeability was a lot easier . Today many salvage parts are more difficult to interchange due to the need for dealer authorized software reprogramming . This not_only makes wrecks increasingly more difficult on late model cars but shrinks the salvage industries market share for good used parts to be sold to independent repair shops . Overall as these tech laden late model cars age they ’ re seeing higher depreciation than ever and lower margins for salvage companies to break them apart for their components . There ’ s still money to be made breaking cars apart but there ’ s not_nearly as much profit in a wrecked vehicle that there was in the past . Repair costs also continue to climb as parts supplies and especially skilled labor increases . The number of people able to do this kind of work is decreasing rapidly . People also don ’ t seem as interested in taking the risks to buy wrecks to rebuild themselves . Especially as used car prices fall . It ’ s becoming much more attractive to buy inwrecked cars with minor mechanical issues and deferred maintenance than to undergo a complete rebuild of a totaled vehicle . With used car depreciation and a surplus of used inventory sitting on lots cars are starting to sell wholesale for prices that make them much more attractive . If you look at the bid no_sale prices mounting up at auction houses like IAA and Adesa you begin to see the reckoning Copart is up against . Why buy a wrecked car that will come with a branded title and a lower resale value along with an increased risk of needing repair much of which you won ’ t know till you dig into the project when you can buy a clean inwrecked car from a dealer trade in at a lower delta than ever . The truth is there are more good reliable well cared for cars at auction right now than there are people with the means to buy them . Lastly many cars that used to go through Copart auctions were bought by foreign buyers . Since the start of the trade war tariffs have greatly affected the profitability of many exporters trying to buy cars from the US . Trade relations have a big effect on Copart sales and the values of salvage cars . There ’ s great risk to Copart from the standpoint of globalization failing and the US pulling back on global trade relations . Just be mindful of these issues if you are looking at Copart as a cheap company . There ’ s good reason that their market cap is declining ."

He was going through a litany of things that stop investors from being successful and was clear that boring DCA investing in diverse securities pays better than managed funds 99.999% of the time at 20 years. In that conversation he mentioned that the old joke was that if you wanted to be successful you should put your money into the market and then do nothing. Like don’t move it, don’t change it, don’t mess with it. You are far more likely to mess things up by trading around than you would be if you bought an index fund and then just never sold it. For what it’s worth, I’ve never learned this lesson and now that I’m getting to be older I might just have to try it…",

      "selftext": "Recently, I've seen a lot of discussion about whether SpaceX will go public. I'd like to share my thoughts. Although SpaceX is well-positioned in the rapidly developing aerospace industry, both SpaceX and Elon Musk have repeatedly stated that they have no plans to go public in the short term. They believe that an IPO would create short-term performance pressure, which would be detrimental to their long-term, high-risk space goals (especially the Mars program). SpaceX will only go public after substantial progress has been made on the Mars program. In my opinion, SpaceX doesn't lack funding; it collaborates with several private equity firms and national defense agencies. Its current valuation has already reached super-unicorn levels. A SpaceX IPO is not a matter of time, but a strategic decision. Of course, Starlink could also go public separately, and I believe the likelihood of a Starlink IPO is far higher than that of SpaceX. Therefore, I am very optimistic about Starlink's short-term prospects. Although I know many people dislike Musk, including myself, we are here to make money, so I hope everyone will express their opinions rationally. Thank you.",

After the powerful rally over the last few days, we are officially knocking on the door of a new All-Time High (ATH) Here are the reasons why I personally believe the stock is about to blast through the ceiling (for reference only): Breakout Above Resistance: Once we clear the previous resistance levels, there is zero overhead supply. This is where the real \"gamma squeeze\" and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) effect will kick in.

With the satellites deploying and the partnership with giants like AT&T, the market is finally pricing in the reality of a global space-based cellular network Short Squeeze Potential: There are still plenty of bears trapped in their positions. A breakout to new highs will force them to cover, adding more fuel to the upward rocket I’ve been watching the charts closely, and the \"higher lows\" we’re seeing are a textbook bullish signal. Once the ATH is confirmed, my price target is $100+ I’m not going to hold this stock forever, but I’m definitely staying in for the duration of this breakout cycle.

Me (38m) has known about Boston Dynamics since I was in high school/early adulthood. I've always thought of them as like \"a leader\" in robotics, but maybe they are just the most well known? Their Atlas robot and Spot dog are pretty cool. Why aren't they publicly traded company? I know you can buy Hyundai, the parent company, just wondered why they weren't traded themselves, it seems like something people would be interested in. Would you invest? Why or why not? Are they just \"the name\" but aren't really the leader or innovators, or even really doing much in the space?",

Me 38m has known about Boston Dynamics since I was in high schoolearly adulthood . Ive always thought of them as like a leader in robotics but maybe they are just the most well known Their Atlas robot and Spot dog are pretty cool . Why arent they publicly traded company I know you can buy Hyundai the parent company just wondered why they werent traded themselves it seems like something people would be interested in . Would you invest Why or why not_Are they just the name but arent really the leader or innovators or even really doing much in the space"

      "selftext": "When Clover AI is the first thing doctors think about in the morning, CLOV belongs in the S&P 500. Share of mind→ market share. 1. Clover becomes a healthcare software company, not just an insurer. 2. Clover AI (Counterpart Health) isn’t admin software, it’s clinical decision intelligence. It helps doctors decide what to do at the point of care, improving outcomes directly. The moat is proprietary clinical data that gets smarter over time. 4. Clover Health has crossed into profitability while still growing fast, which is rare in Medicare Advantage. Hats off to Vivek and the team 🙏. 5. Insiders collectively own \\\\\\~21% of the company. This level of insider stake is relatively high and is generally seen as aligning management’s incentives with shareholders. The biggest insider buy was by Co-Founder & Executive Chairman Vivek Garipalli, who purchased approximatelyy $1M in shares at \\\\\\~$2.24 each. Market Confidence is back. Note: Not financial advice. Do your own DD. I’m just a guy on Reddit. PS: Any healthcare professionals or physicians here who use Counterpart Health (Clover AI)? I’d really appreciate hearing your feedback or experience. Thanks! Update: Posted this on another Reddit thread… still no solid responses from anyone actually using AI Clover Assistant. Holy moly 😅",

Clover becomes a healthcare software company not_just an insurer . 2 . Clover AI Counterpart Health isn ’ t admin software it ’ s clinical decision intelligence . It helps doctors decide what to do at the point of care improving outcomes directly . The moat is proprietary clinical data that gets smarter over time . 4 . Clover Health has crossed into profitability while still growing fast which is rare in Medicare Advantage . Hats off to Vivek and the team 🙏 . 5 . Insiders collectively own 21 % of the company . This level of insider stake is relatively high and is generally seen as aligning management ’ s incentives with shareholders . The biggest insider buy was by CoFounder Executive Chairman Vivek Garipalli who purchased approximatelyy $ 1M in shares at $ 2.24 each . Market Confidence is back . Note Not_financial advice . Do your own DD . I ’ m just a guy on Reddit . PS Any healthcare professionals or physicians here who use Counterpart Health Clover AI I ’ d really appreciate hearing your feedback or experience . Thanks Update Posted this on another Reddit thread… still no_solid responses from anyone actually using AI Clover Assistant . Holy moly 😅"

      "selftext": "Watching RIME today, it feels less like a one-off spike and more like the early phase of price discovery. The stock is up over 20% around $1.23, volume is above 1.2M shares, turnover is near 46%, and the day range has expanded beyond 30% (source type: live market data). Those are not normal conditions for a quiet penny stock. Price discovery phases usually come when new information forces participants to reassess assumptions. Over the past two weeks, RIME has delivered a steady flow of concrete updates: SemiCab ARR up 220% from $2.5M to over $8M, $15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts, and multiple major contract expansions including the Apollo Tyres announcement on Jan 6, 2026 (source type: company press releases). I am not trying to predict where this settles. I am watching how the market digests information now that liquidity and attention are both elevated. When you think a stock has entered price discovery mode, do you focus more on intraday structure or on how it behaves over the next few sessions? Do your own digging.",

      "selftext": "I'm curious about everyone's take on Apple Inc. (AAPL). I've been waiting for a chance to buy the dip, targeting around $200. The question is: Is this expectation realistic? Or am I fixated on a price that may never materialize? On one hand: Compared to Apple's own historical valuations, current levels aren't cheap Growth has slowed significantly compared to the pandemic period When the broader market corrects, tech giants often can't escape declines On the other hand: It is Apple after all， massive buybacks, incredible cash flow, sticky ecosystem Every pullback gets bought up faster than expected Waiting for the “perfect” price has caused many to miss opportunities Thus I face a dilemma: Maintain patience and risk never buying in Or start accumulating positions incrementally, abandoning the quest for the exact bottom For investors holding or considering adding to positions: Do you believe $200 is a realistic possibility, or merely wishful thinking unless the market corrects significantly? Curious how everyone is managing AAPL， fully invested, building positions gradually, or still watching from the sidelines?",

      "selftext": "On Airforce One, Trump said \"we will talk about Greenland in 2 months\" after being asked by a reporter about his intentions there. (I asked the same question here about Venezuela 2 months ago and got deleted by the mods. I hope this time they won't.) So, assuming the US would land on Greenland and try to annex it, what would happen to global markets and stocks? My speculation: Since NATO would basically be canceled, European countries would immediately start to arm up, heavily. They already started to prop up their military a bit, but I think this event will make them go full on militarization, and of course they would buy European. They would also seek to replace existing US equipment. So European defense stocks is the most obvious play here. I can also imagine economic sanctions / tariffs hiked up on the US. That's mainly LNG, oil, pharmaceuticals, machinery, aircrafts. Oil companies, Boeing, Caterpillar, GE and similar stocks will be hit hard. Pharmaceuticals like Pfizer or Eli Lilly will be spared in the short-run but Europe will heavily invest to become independent from the US as well, which could be good for Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, Biontech, Bayer, FMC and the like. In the same vein, Europe will seek to become less dependent on US software / tech and AI. Since European governments will seek fast progress, they will likely rely on successfull incumbents with the necessary talent and infrastructure, like SAP, Atos, Dassault, Siemens, Amadeus and the like. What would you add to the list and how would you position for such an event?",

      "selftext_processed": "On Airforce One Trump said we will talk about Greenland in 2 months after being asked by a reporter about his intentions there . I asked the same question here about Venezuela 2 months ago and got deleted by the mods . I hope this time they wont . So assuming the US would land on Greenland and try to annex it what would happen to global markets and stocks My speculation Since NATO would basically be canceled European countries would immediately start to arm up heavily . They already started to prop up their military a bit but I think this event will make them go full on militarization and of course they would buy European . They would also seek to replace existing US equipment . So European defense stocks is the most obvious play here . I can also imagine economic sanctions tariffs hiked up on the US . Thats mainly LNG oil pharmaceuticals machinery aircrafts . Oil companies Boeing Caterpillar GE and similar stocks will be hit hard . Pharmaceuticals like Pfizer or Eli Lilly will be spared in the shortrun but Europe will heavily invest to become independent from the US as well which could be good for Novartis Roche Sanofi Biontech Bayer FMC and the like . In the same vein Europe will seek to become less dependent on US software tech and AI . Since European governments will seek fast progress they will likely rely on successfull incumbents with the necessary talent and infrastructure like SAP Atos Dassault Siemens Amadeus and the like . What would you add to the list and how would you position for such an event"

From Nasdaq.com: CVNA Insider Activity Insider Trade 12 Months Number of Shares Bought: 3,408,304 Number of Shares Sold: 9,004,135 End Quote In the last 12 months Carvana CVNA has issued it’s directors and Officers 3.4 million shares (primarily through Options Exercise substantially below current market value) Over the same 12 month period CVNA officers have sold roughly 9 Million shares at prices between $200-$400 for approx 2-3 Billion USD. The company only estimates Annual Net Profit of around $629 Million. The problem is NOBODY in the car business operates at anywhere near the margins CVNA claims to be operating. Autonation, CARMAX, Lithia- The largest and most efficient operators in the car business are not even close to the level of profitability CVNA claims. There is a small chance Carvana insiders ARE NOT using their outsized stock sale gains to fluff the financial reports. But the more I review the financials the less likely that seems",

      "selftext": "**TL;DR** FactSet is being valued as if its core business is weakening, despite decades of consistent, subscription-driven growth and high customer retention. The company continues to generate predictable cash flows through multiple market cycles, while current valuation reflects unusually low expectations. The opportunity here is it is mispriced as risk due to AI, but it will remain durable. **Background** FactSet sells financial data and analytics to institutional investors, asset managers, wealth firms, and corporates. Its product is embedded in client workflows, which makes switching painful and churn low. For this reason, retention stays high even when asset managers are under pressure, cutting headcount, or seeing AUM decline. FactSet’s revenue doesn’t depend on optimism or inflows — it depends on necessity. Most revenue is subscription-based, which gives the business strong visibility and predictability. That model has worked for a long time. FactSet has now grown revenue every year for over four decades. **Recent Earnings** In its most recent fiscal year (ended August 31, 2025), FactSet reported: • Revenue of $2.32B, up about 5% year over year • Organic Annual Subscription Value (ASV) growth of ~5.7% • Net income of ~$597M, up ~11% • GAAP EPS of $15.55, up nearly 12% • Continued strong free cash flow, alongside dividends and share buybacks Guidance for FY 2026 calls for 4–6% organic ASV growth and revenue of roughly $2.42–2.45B. **Why Stock is Low** Margins have come under pressure, mainly from higher compensation and ongoing technology investment. FactSet, however, isn’t spending defensively — it’s spending to deepen the product and expand how clients use its data. **Why that Doesn’t Matter** A key point that gets overlooked is that FactSet owns and curates a large portion of its proprietary data. That matters in an AI-driven environment. Many competitors rely more heavily on third-party data, which limits pricing power and flexibility when new tools are layered on top. FactSet’s approach allows it to integrate AI into workflows without giving away the core asset that clients are paying for. **Position**",

      "title": "Hyundai Motor Group plans to deploy humanoid robots at U.S. factory from 2028",
      "selftext": "Hyundai Motor Group plans to deploy humanoid robots at its U.S. manufacturing plant in Georgia starting in 2028, marking a step toward ⁠automating higher-risk and repetitive manufacturing tasks, the South Korean company said. Hyundai unveiled the production version of ‍the Atlas humanoid robot, ‍developed by its ‍unit Boston Dynamics, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The company did not disclose the volume or cost of the robots, but said in a ‌statement ‌it aims to roll out adoption across all ​of its manufacturing sites as part of a push into “physical AI”. The robots will initially carry out parts sequencing tasks from 2028, with applications expanding gradually as safety and quality benefits ⁠are validated, it said. By 2030, Hyundai said Atlas robots were expected to move into component assembly with a longer-term plan to take on tasks involving heavy loads, repetitive motions and complex operations across production sites. The robots are designed to reduce physical strain on workers by taking on higher-risk and repetitive tasks, laying the groundwork for broader commercial use in industrial settings, it said. At Hyundai Motor’s affiliate Kia Corp, the labor union last year called to establish a body to address potential labour rights issues in preparation for the AI era, as workers raised concerns about expanding automation. The company expects humanoid robots to become the ‍largest segment of the physical artificial intelligence market, which refers to AI systems ‌embedded in hardware that collect real-world data and make ⁠autonomous decisions, spanning areas such as robotics, smart factories and autonomous driving. Atlas features human-scale hands with tactile sensing and has the ‍ability to lift up to 50 kg (110 pounds), according to Hyundai. The robot can operate autonomously and is designed to function in industrial environments ranging from minus 20 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius. Hyundai said it is accelerating development in this area through partnerships with global AI leaders, ⁠including a collaboration with Nvidia and Google, ‌aimed at improving safety, efficiency and real-world deployment.

      "selftext_processed": "Hyundai Motor Group plans to deploy humanoid robots at its U.S. manufacturing plant in Georgia starting in 2028 marking a step toward ⁠automating higherrisk and repetitive manufacturing tasks the South Korean company said . Hyundai unveiled the production version of ‍the Atlas humanoid robot ‍developed by its ‍unit Boston Dynamics at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas . The company did not_disclose the volume or cost of the robots but said in a ‌statement ‌it aims to roll out adoption across all ​of its manufacturing sites as part of a push into “ physical AI ” . The robots will initially carry out parts sequencing tasks from 2028 with applications expanding gradually as safety and quality benefits ⁠are validated it said . By 2030 Hyundai said Atlas robots were expected to move into component assembly with a longerterm plan to take on tasks involving heavy loads repetitive motions and complex operations across production sites . The robots are designed to reduce physical strain on workers by taking on higherrisk and repetitive tasks laying the groundwork for broader commercial use in industrial settings it said . At Hyundai Motor ’ s affiliate Kia Corp the labor union last year called to establish a body to address potential labour rights issues in preparation for the AI era as workers raised concerns about expanding automation . The company expects humanoid robots to become the ‍largest segment of the physical artificial intelligence market which refers to AI systems ‌embedded in hardware that collect realworld data and make ⁠autonomous decisions spanning areas such as robotics smart factories and autonomous driving . Atlas features humanscale hands with tactile sensing and has the ‍ability to lift up to 50 kg 110 pounds according to Hyundai . The robot can operate autonomously and is designed to function in industrial environments ranging from minus 20 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius . Hyundai said it is accelerating development in this area through partnerships with global AI leaders ⁠including a collaboration with Nvidia and Google ‌aimed at improving safety efficiency and realworld deployment .

Vision-first autonomy, end-to-end nets, “physical AI,” reasoning, edge inference, the whole Tesla stack is becoming the default storyline. Mobileye looks like “L2+ is the business model, L4 can wait,” which is basically OEMs admitting they’re not shipping robotaxis anytime soon. Nvidia is like “here are the chips and models,” but OEMs still have to cook… and most can’t even boil water without a supplier. Bull case is simple: if Tesla scales driverless in real cities (not demos), TSLA rerates again. Bear case is also simple: if it stalls, it’s just another hype loop. Either way, CES didn’t prove Tesla won, it proved the industry is moving to Tesla’s architecture… late.",

Novo Nordisk (**NVO**) has seen a significant boost in its stock over the last few trading days (in 5 days **11%**), primarily driven by the official U.S. launch of the **Wegovy Pill**.

I made money off of **$ONDS** today but I've started rethinking the choice within the industry. I'm starting to do research between these four unprofitable companies at the moment: **$AVAV** \\- By far the most established and closest to turning profitable, high Inst Ownership, all for less room to grow. Also high Insider Ownership however. Zero hype. **$ONDS** \\- Contender for worst financials in my opinion, by far the highest hype value. Very low Insider and Inst Ownership. Feels very overvalued but will never buy puts. **$RCAT** \\- Meh financials. Medium Inst and Insider Ownership. Hype but I don't agree. The ticker is there but I can't see the point. **$UMAC** \\- Newest, smallest, highest potential for growth. Currently horrible financials, and easily the best return if they all perform the same, but Trump Jr. advisory board sellout scares me a lot and I can't bring myself to trust it. \\+ Definitely should have included **$AMPX** I'd love to hear y'alls thoughts on them and any additions you might have to the screener.",

Im starting to do research between these four unprofitable companies at the moment $ AVAV By far the most established and closest to turning profitable high Inst Ownership all for less room to grow . Also high Insider Ownership however . Zero hype . $ ONDS Contender for worst financials in my opinion by far the highest hype value . Very low Insider and Inst Ownership . Feels very overvalued but will never_buy puts . $ RCAT Meh financials . Medium Inst and Insider Ownership . Hype but I dont agree . The ticker is there but I cant see the point . $ UMAC Newest smallest highest potential for growth . Currently horrible financials and easily the best return if they all perform the same but Trump Jr. advisory board sellout scares me a lot and I cant bring myself to trust it .

      "title": "Nvidia launches Vera Rubin AI platform at CES 2026, claims 4x fewer GPUs needed vs Blackwell and 10x lower inference token costs",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) announced the launch of its next-generation Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas. One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform, Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor. >Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI, advanced reasoning models, and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which combine a series of “expert” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks. >“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. >“With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI.” >In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs, the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips: the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch, Nvidia ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, Nvidia BlueField-4 DPU, and Nvidia Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch. >All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia’s Vera Rubin NVL72 server, which combines 72 GPUs into a single system. Join several NVL72s together, and you get Nvidia’s DGX SuperPOD, a kind of massive AI supercomputer. These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on. >Nvidia is also touting its AI storage, called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage, which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillion-parameter and multi-step reasoning AI models. >All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia’s previous-generation Grace Blackwell offering. >According to the company, Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems. >Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks, improving efficiency. Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs. >Tokens in AI models represent things like words, parts of sentences, images, and videos. Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization. >But processing tokens is a resource-intensive, and therefore energy-hungry, process, especially when you’re dealing with enormous AI models. Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors. >Nvidia says it’s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production. >Nvidia’s chip lead has made it the world’s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $4.6 billion. In October, its market cap swelled to more than $5 trillion, but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price. >The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD (AMD), which is launching its own Helios racks-scale systems to compete with the NVLink 72, as well as its own customers. >In October, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) announced that Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) will expand the use of their respective custom processors, which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform. Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic. >And according to The Information, Google is having conversations with Meta (META) and other cloud companies about use of the search giant’s chips in their data centers. >Still, neither AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon. And if it’s able to continue its yearly release schedule, it will be even more difficult for them to catch up.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source AI powerhouse Nvidia NVDA announced the launch of its nextgeneration Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas . One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor . Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI advanced reasoning models and mixtureofexperts MoE models which combine a series of “ expert ” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks . “ Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof ” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement . “ With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI. ” In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch Nvidia ConnectX9 SuperNIC Nvidia BlueField4 DPU and Nvidia Spectrum6 Ethernet Switch . All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia ’ s Vera Rubin NVL72 server which combines 72 GPUs into a single system . Join several NVL72s together and you get Nvidia ’ s DGX SuperPOD a kind of massive AI supercomputer . These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft Google Amazon and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on . Nvidia is also touting its AI storage called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillionparameter and multistep reasoning AI models . All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia ’ s previousgeneration Grace Blackwell offering . According to the company Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems . Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks improving efficiency . Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs . Tokens in AI models represent things like words parts of sentences images and videos . Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization . But processing tokens is a resourceintensive and therefore energyhungry process especially when you ’ re dealing with enormous AI models . Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors . Nvidia says it ’ s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production . Nvidia ’ s chip lead has made it the world ’ s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $ 4.6 billion . In October its market cap swelled to more than $ 5 trillion but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price . The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD AMD which is launching its own Helios racksscale systems to compete with the NVLink 72 as well as its own customers . In October Google GOOG GOOGL and Amazon AMZN announced that Anthropic ANTH.PVT will expand the use of their respective custom processors which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform . Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic . And according to The Information Google is having conversations with Meta META and other cloud companies about use of the search giant ’ s chips in their data centers . Still neither_AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon . And if it ’ s able to continue its yearly release schedule it will be even more difficult for them to catch up ."

      "selftext": "Just a very quick cautionary tale for those many of you who, like me, find themselves frequently trying to time the market but you convince yourself it's not the same reckless timing the market you keep reading about. Some of you are legit day trading or just playing around with a small amount you're willing to lose and I get that, but I know a few of us try to time volatility to a lesser extent. I wasn't much of a trader, had it all in VTI/VONG/SCHD for about 3 years which was going swimmingly. No idea what came over me but April 7th I thought we were in for at least another 7-10% drop. There was some \"logic\" to it but it was definitely an emotional/panic sell. I wasn't afraid of *losing* X amount, or that it wouldn't rebound. BUT, I believed that it was going to keep sliding for a bit so I thought I could #TimeTheMarket (sell before the bottom then buy back in like a month later). What ended up happening was I sold VTI at $242, the literal bottom lmao, then played with SQQQ for a few days while nothing really seemed to happen (made a couple hundred dollars in the meantime). *Then*, the tariff pause tweet. Inside of like 2min I lost 10% of my portfolio to SQQQ (who tf was buying my SQQQ mid-spike by the way?) and was basically down something like -24% of my portfolio and the market had just rebounded. Sick to my stomach for days, for weeks. Awful feeling, and I know some of you know it too. I'm mid 30's with a family and we're not talking about just a couple grand. Bought back in with VTI $267 and then pounced on a couple opps like Google's big drop and a few small gambles on Planet Labs/Lantronix/DUOT that I got super lucky with. Those and a bull market have brought me from behind the S&P500 by like 28% at one point to only behind by like 8% now. But oh my gosh so much time and stress just to get within spitting distance of the market... Just kind of word vomiting so thanks for reading. Honestly sharing my experience in the hopes: 1. Those of you getting really lucky remember that, like trust, a portfolio built through dozens of good moves can be broken by one bad one if you aren't careful. Or... 2. Those of you that have lost a lot on options/panic selling/etc. know you can climb out of the hole if you reflect on what went wrong in your process. But in the inverse of #1, it takes a lot of good decisions to make up for the one bad one, let alone a couple bad ones (please don't double down on reckless unless it's money you're willing to lose). \\------------------------- **TLDR**: Convinced myself I wasn't panic selling April 7th but the reality is the same, held SQQQ during tariff pause, through a ton of time and stress back close to market % but don't recommend. Bogleheads might be onto something...",

      "selftext_processed": "Just a very quick cautionary tale for those many of you who like me find themselves frequently trying to time the market but you convince yourself its not_the same reckless timing the market you keep reading about . Some of you are legit day trading or just playing around with a small amount youre willing to lose and I get that but I know a few of us try to time volatility to a lesser extent . I wasnt much of a trader had it all in VTIVONGSCHD for about 3 years which was going swimmingly . No_idea what came over me but April 7th I thought we were in for at least another 710 % drop . There was some logic to it but it was definitely an emotionalpanic sell . I wasnt afraid of losing X amount or that it wouldnt rebound . BUT I believed that it was going to keep sliding for a bit so I thought I could Time The Market sell before the bottom then buy back in like a month later . What ended up happening was I sold VTI at $ 242 the literal bottom lmao then played with SQQQ for a few days while nothing_really seemed to happen made a couple hundred dollars in the meantime . Then the tariff pause tweet . Inside of like 2min I lost 10 % of my portfolio to SQQQ who tf was buying my SQQQ midspike by the way and was basically down something like 24 % of my portfolio and the market had just rebounded . Sick to my stomach for days for weeks . Awful feeling and I know some of you know it too . Im mid 30s with a family and were not_talking about just a couple grand . Bought back in with VTI $ 267 and then pounced on a couple opps like Googles big drop and a few small gambles on Planet LabsLantronixDUOT that I got super lucky with . Those and a bull market have brought me from behind the SP500 by like 28 % at one point to only behind by like 8 % now . But oh my gosh so much time and stress just to get within spitting distance of the market ... Just kind of word vomiting so thanks for reading . Honestly sharing my experience in the hopes 1 . Those of you getting really lucky remember that like trust a portfolio built through dozens of good moves can be broken by one bad one if you arent careful . Or ... 2 . Those of you that have lost a lot on optionspanic sellingetc . know you can climb out of the hole if you reflect on what went wrong in your process . But in the inverse of 1 it takes a lot of good decisions to make up for the one bad one let alone a couple bad ones please dont double down on reckless unless its money youre willing to lose . TLDR Convinced myself I wasnt panic selling April 7th but the reality is the same held SQQQ during tariff pause through a ton of time and stress back close to market % but dont recommend . Bogleheads might be onto something ..."

      "title": "What are the significant announcements made today by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at CES 2026",
      "selftext": "There was a lot of information provided to us during the keynote speech by Jensen Huang. At CES 2026, NVIDIA unveiled its most ambitious AI roadmap yet, headlined by the Rubin platform, a six-chip, extreme-codesigned AI system, and a suite of open models spanning healthcare, robotics, and autonomous driving. The company also showcased its vision for “physical AI” with real-world applications in vehicles, robots, and manufacturing. Rubin is NVIDIA’s first co-designed, six-chip AI platform which succeeds the Blackwell architecture. Rubin GPUs produce 50 petaflops of NVFP4 inference. Vera CPUs are optimized for data movement and agentic processing. NVLink 6 and Spectrum-X provide High-speed networking. ConnectX-9 SuperNICs and BlueField-4 DPUs for data center acceleration. Inference Context Memory Storage is a new AI-native KV-cache tier offering 5x better performance per dollar and power efficiency. This combined architecture delivers AI tokens at 1/10th the cost and accelerate time-to-market for frontier models. NVIDIA emphasized its commitment to open, frontier AI models trained on its supercomputers across six domains: 1. Healthcare (Clara platform) for medical imaging, diagnostics. 2. Climate (Earth-2) for climate modeling and forecasting. 3. Reasoning (Nemotron) for multimodal and logical reasoning. 4. Robotics (Cosmos) for simulation and embodied AI. 5. Embodied AI (GR00T) for physical interaction and learning. 6. Autonomy (Alpamayo) for autonomous driving (Level 4-ready) These models are open-source, enabling global collaboration and deployment. Autonomous Driving with Alpamayo & Mercedes-Benz CLA Alpamayo R1 is the first open reasoning Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for AVs. AlpaSim is an open simulation blueprint for high-fidelity AV testing. Mercedes-Benz CLA is the first production car with Alpamayo, launching in the U.S. in 2026. DRIVE Hyperion is NVIDIA’s modular, Level 4-ready AV platform which continues gaining traction with automakers and robotaxi firms. DGX Spark & Personal Agents for AI on every desk. DGX Spark is a desktop AI supercomputer with up to 2.6x performance for large models that supports local AI agents using Hugging Face models through a robot called Reachy Mini. There will be new support for Lightricks LTX-12 and FLUX image models and NVIDIA AI Enterprise is coming to DGX Spark for broader deployment. From Simulation to Real-World Robotics with Physical AI NVIDIA Cosmos trains robots using video, simulation, and real-world data and is capable of generating realistic videos from single images, modeling edge-case driving scenarios, and performing physical reasoning and trajectory prediction. Isaac Sim & Isaac Lab are used to train robots in photorealistic virtual environments. There was also a partnership announced with Siemens that expands collaboration to integrate NVIDIA’s stack into industrial automation and digital twins. NVIDIA now builds entire AI systems, from chips to software, to eliminate bottlenecks and accelerate innovation through open models. CEO Jensen Huang said, “Our job is to create the entire stack so that all of you can create incredible applications for the rest of the world.”",

Also interesting that Jensen said next-gen stuff is **already in production**. In AI, whoever ships first usually wins the orders. Yeah, valuation isn’t cheap no argument there. But NVDA doesn’t really trade on “cheap,” it trades on **who controls the stack**. I’m still holding a core position and trading around it.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone! I’m looking for some guidance and opinions. I’m a 47 year old small business owner in Pennsylvania. I opened a Fidelity UTMA for my son when he turned 1 year old in July 2025. He’s now 1.5 years old, and I plan to contribute roughly $10,000 per year going forward. I automatically put $100 in each week plus Christmas/birthday money goes in I’ve been trying to do my due diligence, but honestly there’s so much information out there that I’m getting confused, and I’m not confident I’m approaching this the right way. So far he has 6 shares of NVDA, 59 shares of FSELX, 29 shares of FSPGX, 300 shares of HGRAF & 22 shares of KGC. This is meant to be a long-term growth account (college, early adulthood, etc.). I’m open to a “set and forget” approach if that’s the smartest move. I mainly want something sensible and repeatable each year without constantly second-guessing myself. Should I just VOO or VTI and chill? Thanks in advance! I really appreciate the help!",

      "selftext": "So just to give some context I am an 18 year old college freshman and started my own bank accounts late November 2025. Currently I have my checking account with Capital One and I do both my savings as well as investing with Sofi (High APY+ I love their UI). I have a part time job where I make minimum wage, so I'm not exactly talking about significant amounts of money, just a few thousands. I live with my parents still so my only expenses turn out to about $60 a month + whatever I spent on food or entertainment. I think I just feel a little lost especially hearing from different sources across the web as well as not fully understanding my own investment goals yet. Right now the main thing I'd like to save/invest for is my first car, as well as money for travel because I love to travel and I'd like to see as much of the world as possible while I have my youth. Longer term, I wouldn't mind having that safety net which long term investment could provide for me. More specifically, I also might use some savings sometime down the line to help finance a short film project since I am a film major and early on self financing is one of the only ways really you can get your stuff off the ground. As well, (sorry I keep adding stuff) I'm in community college right now and may transfer so it would be nice to have some money to help my parents out in case I do in a few years. So I guess my horizon would be in the 5-10 year range but I also wouldn't mind holding for decades to see that return later on in life. So I have most of my money in savings right now where I currently have a 4% APY with Sofi because of the 0.7% boost to new Sofi+ subscribers (eligible deposit). I have a decent amount of my money in stocks however, with a good portion of it (around 60%) in VOO. I also have NVDA, IREN (I hope the bubble doesn't burst), and TTWO (GTA 6 lol). As well, I also started off with one of those Robo invest accounts Sofi has but I have a lot less money in there (1/5 the amount of self-investment) is it worth it to even continue that one? It currently has a 0.25% advisory fee and I'm getting modest ROI though a bit lower than the self directed one. It's on moderately aggressive and I've been debating setting it to aggressive. Right now I just kind of feel like I don't know what I'm doing I see a lot of people online saying \"VOO and chill\" but I'm just wondering whether that's the best option specifically considering my horizon such as wanting a car by this year. I just kind of look at the funny line that goes up and down and say \"that looks good!\" lmao. But seriously I just don't know if I'm doing this right and whether I should diversify more or go for riskier stocks or I'm not sure what. I'd say my risk tolerance is pretty good, I don't get super scared when I see a slight downturn but of course I feel a bit of a twinge of panic when that happens. But still, I think I might have diamond hands haha. Also a few things I was wondering about would it be good to buy Gold right now I've seen videos that it's kind of skyrocketing due to increased mistrust in USD. Along those lines, would it be smart to continue buying VOO as it only represents American S&P 500? I know the US market won't crumble overnight or anything I'm just wondering if it would be smart to look into international ETF's and stocks. Also, I find dividends slightly interesting is it worth looking at dividends and dividend investing for some passive income? Any help is greatly appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "So just to give some context I am an 18 year old college freshman and started my own bank accounts late November 2025 . Currently I have my checking account with Capital One and I do both my savings as well as investing with Sofi High APY I love their UI . I have a part time job where I make minimum wage so Im not_exactly talking about significant amounts of money just a few thousands . I live with my parents still so my only expenses turn out to about $ 60 a month whatever I spent on food or entertainment . I think I just feel a little lost especially hearing from different sources across the web as well as not_fully understanding my own investment goals yet . Right now the main thing Id like to saveinvest for is my first car as well as money for travel because I love to travel and Id like to see as much of the world as possible while I have my youth . Longer term I wouldnt mind having that safety net which long term investment could provide for me . More specifically I also might use some savings sometime down the line to help finance a short film project since I am a film major and early on self financing is one of the only ways really you can get your stuff off the ground . As well sorry I keep adding stuff Im in community college right now and may transfer so it would be nice to have some money to help my parents out in case I do in a few years . So I guess my horizon would be in the 510 year range but I also wouldnt mind holding for decades to see that return later on in life . So I have most of my money in savings right now where I currently have a 4 % APY with Sofi because of the 0.7 % boost to new Sofi subscribers eligible deposit . I have a decent amount of my money in stocks however with a good portion of it around 60 % in VOO . I also have NVDA IREN I hope the bubble doesnt burst and TTWO GTA 6 lol . As well I also started off with one of those Robo invest accounts Sofi has but I have a lot less money in there 15 the amount of selfinvestment is it worth it to even continue that one It currently has a 0.25 % advisory fee and Im getting modest ROI though a bit lower than the self directed one . Its on moderately aggressive and Ive been debating setting it to aggressive . Right now I just kind of feel like I dont know what Im doing I see a lot of people online saying VOO and chill but Im just wondering whether thats the best option specifically considering my horizon such as wanting a car by this year . I just kind of look at the funny line that goes up and down and say that looks good lmao . But seriously I just dont know if Im doing this right and whether I should diversify more or go for riskier stocks or Im not_sure what . Id say my risk tolerance is pretty good I dont get super scared when I see a slight downturn but of course I feel a bit of a twinge of panic when that happens . But still I think I might have diamond hands haha . Also a few things I was wondering about would it be good to buy Gold right now Ive seen videos that its kind of skyrocketing due to increased mistrust in USD . Along those lines would it be smart to continue buying VOO as it only represents American SP 500 I know the US market wont crumble overnight or anything Im just wondering if it would be smart to look into international ETFs and stocks . Also I find dividends slightly interesting is it worth looking at dividends and dividend investing for some passive income Any help is greatly appreciated ."

It's to the point where, if you aren't making a decent amount you genuinely getting scammed or the universe hates you. It really can't be that hard yo 😮‍💨 and I'm not gonna lie, some of you just be choosing to fail (not failing as in going to negatives, but as in not making a decent amount), it actually feels illegal for me to investing like this. Sometimes though it might not be your fault, I've had days where I couldn't sell my stocks because they were just too large and they plummeted etc, sometimes the market is unpredictable and things that should take months or longer can happen in days or weeks.

      "title": "Microsoft’s Nadella wants us to stop thinking of AI as ‘slop’",
      "selftext": "A few weeks after Merriam-Webster named “slop” its Word of the Year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared his thoughts on the future of AI in 2026. In his signature intellectual style on his personal blog, Nadella wrote that he hopes we stop thinking of AI as “garbage” and start seeing it as a “bicycle for the mind.” He wrote, “A new concept that develops the ‘bicycle for the mind’ into a tool for progress, encouraging us to always see AI as a scaffold for human potential, not a replacement.” He went on: “We need to move beyond the debate between rough and refined, and build a new balance in our ‘theory of mind’ to explain how humans are equipped with these new cognitive enhancement tools in their interactions with one another.” If you parse his words carefully, it’s clear that he’s not just urging people to stop dismissing AI-generated content as garbage he’s also hoping the tech industry will stop treating AI as a replacement for humans. He wants the industry to begin seeing it as a productivity tool that augments human work. But there’s a problem with this framework: the marketing of AI agents largely relies on the idea of replacing human labor to justify pricing and make costs seem reasonable. Meanwhile, some AI leaders have issued warnings that the technology could soon drive very high unemployment. For example, in May of this year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could replace half of entry-level white-collar jobs and push the unemployment rate to 10–20% within five years. Last month, he reiterated this warning in an interview on *60 Minutes*. However, the reality of these doomsday predictions remains unclear. As Nadella implied, most AI tools today do not replace workers they are used by workers (as long as humans are willing to check the accuracy of AI’s work). MIT’s ongoing Project Iceberg is often cited in studies measuring AI’s economic impact on the workforce. The project estimates that AI is currently capable of performing roughly 11.7% of paid human labor. While many reports suggest AI could replace nearly 12% of jobs, the project clarifies that its estimate refers to how much work could potentially be outsourced to AI. Then it calculates the wages associated with those outsourced tasks. Examples include automating nurses’ paperwork and AI-generated computer code. This doesn’t mean AI has seriously impacted every job. According to an article on Substack called *Blood in the Machine*, corporate graphic designers and marketing bloggers are two examples. Similarly, unemployment remains high for entry-level programmers fresh out of college. Yet it’s undeniable that skilled artists, writers, and programmers using AI tools produce work that’s often superior to those without these skills. AI still cannot replace human creativity. As we move into 2026, some data suggest that the professions making the greatest progress with AI are actually thriving not surprisingly. A report from Vanguard Group forecasting the 2026 economy found that “roughly 100 of the occupations most susceptible to AI automation are outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of employment growth and real wage growth.” The report concludes that those who know how to use AI effectively are making themselves more valuable, not more replaceable. Ironically, Microsoft’s moves last year may have fueled the narrative that “AI will steal our jobs.” The company laid off over 15,000 employees in 2025, despite record high revenue and profit in the previous fiscal year (ending in June), which it credited to AI success. Nadella even wrote a public memo on the layoffs after the earnings announcement. Notably, he did not say that internal AI efficiency improvements caused the layoffs. But he did say Microsoft needed to “reimagine our mission in the new era” and listed “AI transformation” as one of three core business priorities in this era (the other two being security and quality). The truth about AI-driven unemployment in 2025 is far more complex. As the Vanguard report notes, it’s less about AI efficiency and more about conventional business decisions that may be less attractive to investors like halting investment in slow-growth areas in favor of fast-growing ones. Fairly speaking, Microsoft is not the only company developing AI while laying off staff. According to CNBC, research from Challenger, Gray & Christmas shows that this technology is expected to have displaced nearly 55,000 U.S. workers by 2025. The report also notes that Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, and other tech firms conducted large scale layoffs last year, even as they actively developed AI. To be fair, those of us who spend too much time on social media watching memes and AI generated short videos might think that “garbage” is one of the most entertaining uses of AI even if not the best.",

      "selftext_processed": "A few weeks after MerriamWebster named “ slop ” its Word of the Year Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared his thoughts on the future of AI in 2026 . In his signature intellectual style on his personal blog Nadella wrote that he hopes we stop thinking of AI as “ garbage ” and start seeing it as a “ bicycle for the mind. ” He wrote “ A new concept that develops the ‘ bicycle for the mind ’ into a tool for progress encouraging us to always see AI as a scaffold for human potential not_a replacement. ” He went on “ We need to move beyond the debate between rough and refined and build a new balance in our ‘ theory of mind ’ to explain how humans are equipped with these new cognitive enhancement tools in their interactions with one another. ” If you parse his words carefully it ’ s clear that he ’ s not_just urging people to stop dismissing AIgenerated content as garbage he ’ s also hoping the tech industry will stop treating AI as a replacement for humans . He wants the industry to begin seeing it as a productivity tool that augments human work . But there ’ s a problem with this framework the marketing of AI agents largely relies on the idea of replacing human labor to justify pricing and make costs seem reasonable . Meanwhile some AI leaders have issued warnings that the technology could soon drive very high unemployment . For example in May of this year Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could replace half of entrylevel whitecollar jobs and push the unemployment rate to 10–20 % within five years . Last month he reiterated this warning in an interview on 60 Minutes . However the reality of these doomsday predictions remains unclear . As Nadella implied most AI tools today do not_replace workers they are used by workers as long as humans are willing to check the accuracy of AI ’ s work . MIT ’ s ongoing Project Iceberg is often cited in studies measuring AI ’ s economic impact on the workforce . The project estimates that AI is currently capable of performing roughly 11.7 % of paid human labor . While many reports suggest AI could replace nearly 12 % of jobs the project clarifies that its estimate refers to how much work could potentially be outsourced to AI . Then it calculates the wages associated with those outsourced tasks . Examples include automating nurses ’ paperwork and AIgenerated computer code . This doesn ’ t mean AI has seriously impacted every job . According to an article on Substack called Blood in the Machine corporate graphic designers and marketing bloggers are two examples . Similarly unemployment remains high for entrylevel programmers fresh out of college . Yet it ’ s undeniable that skilled artists writers and programmers using AI tools produce work that ’ s often superior to those without these skills . AI still can not replace human creativity . As we move into 2026 some data suggest that the professions making the greatest progress with AI are actually thriving not_surprisingly . A report from Vanguard Group forecasting the 2026 economy found that “ roughly 100 of the occupations most susceptible to AI automation are outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of employment growth and real wage growth. ” The report concludes that those who know how to use AI effectively are making themselves more valuable not_more replaceable . Ironically Microsoft ’ s moves last year may have fueled the narrative that “ AI will steal our jobs. ” The company laid off over 15000 employees in 2025 despite record high revenue and profit in the previous fiscal year ending in June which it credited to AI success . Nadella even wrote a public memo on the layoffs after the earnings announcement . Notably he did not_say that internal AI efficiency improvements caused the layoffs . But he did say Microsoft needed to “ reimagine our mission in the new era ” and listed “ AI transformation ” as one of three core business priorities in this era the other two being security and quality . The truth about AIdriven unemployment in 2025 is far more complex . As the Vanguard report notes it ’ s less about AI efficiency and more about conventional business decisions that may be less attractive to investors like halting investment in slowgrowth areas in favor of fastgrowing ones . Fairly speaking Microsoft is not_the only company developing AI while laying off staff . According to CNBC research from Challenger Gray Christmas shows that this technology is expected to have displaced nearly 55000 U.S. workers by 2025 . The report also notes that Amazon Salesforce Microsoft and other tech firms conducted large scale layoffs last year even as they actively developed AI . To be fair those of us who spend too much time on social media watching memes and AI generated short videos might think that “ garbage ” is one of the most entertaining uses of AI even if not_the best ."

I am not a numbers guy so I do not think I will ever become smarter than a hedge fund manager or be able to recognize things that are not market manipulations like pump and dumps. I have a healthcare background so can understand some science. For the last year Ive been reading science related news and even subscribed to the journal Nature. Which is a great source for new science but I need to develop a disciplined approach to follow up with periodically looking for new companies and investments. Like these newly published studies sometimes do not even have venture capital lined up or google search results I could follow up on to look for new companies trying to become profitable. Which I assume is when some of you guys start paying attention to companies. I am not saying I will find the next Nvidia easily but it was figured out gpus could be used for AI years before Chatgpt triggered the AI bubble. One of my first moves was to invest in the company Sana Biotechnology which had a successful development of a cell that produced insulin in one patient that did not trigger an autoimmune response. The issue is someone with lots of money doubled the stock before my purchase went through and I missed most of the stock price increase so far. I know traditionally index funds and etfs were better for people like me but the US stock market with this K shaped economy is not traditional. I can afford to lose money speculating and honestly I find it interesting learning what I have been learning so it has become a hobby almost. I do not want to go so far as to gamble on options. So this seems like a good niche for me to learn new science trends before they become popular and profitable.",

I am not_a numbers guy so I do not_think I will ever become smarter than a hedge fund manager or be able to recognize things that are not_market manipulations like pump and dumps . I have a healthcare background so can understand some science . For the last year Ive been reading science related news and even subscribed to the journal Nature . Which is a great source for new science but I need to develop a disciplined approach to follow up with periodically looking for new companies and investments . Like these newly published studies sometimes do not_even have venture capital lined up or google search results I could follow up on to look for new companies trying to become profitable . Which I assume is when some of you guys start paying attention to companies . I am not_saying I will find the next Nvidia easily but it was figured out gpus could be used for AI years before Chatgpt triggered the AI bubble . One of my first moves was to invest in the company Sana Biotechnology which had a successful development of a cell that produced insulin in one patient that did not_trigger an autoimmune response . The issue is someone with lots of money doubled the stock before my purchase went through and I missed most of the stock price increase so far . I know traditionally index funds and etfs were better for people like me but the US stock market with this K shaped economy is not_traditional . I can afford to lose money speculating and honestly I find it interesting learning what I have been learning so it has become a hobby almost . I do not_want to go so far as to gamble on options . So this seems like a good niche for me to learn new science trends before they become popular and profitable ."

      "selftext": "Yesterday I posted on the true meaning of Venezeula to energy security, specifically to Uranium & Rare Earths. I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days. Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed, I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand. Check this: Uranium isn’t ripping because of headlines. It’s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action. For years the narrative was “renewables can do it” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible. That was suppression. Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression. Inventories got drained. Mines stayed closed. Licensing stayed slow. Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing. Now you’re seeing the change. Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance: Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing, deployment, and implementation of nuclear energy policies. That hearing isn’t symbolic, it’s strategic. Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can’t meet AI and industrial demand any other way. ￼ This isn’t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point. This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog. That’s the kind of government-level pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security. ￼ You can see markets already moving on this. NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn’t just talk - congressional heat makes it more real. ￼ All the anti-nuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue. AI energy demand exposed the grid’s limitations, and the same committee that has talked about AI’s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes. ￼ This is the political backing that breaks suppression. When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year, that signals policy momentum, not posturing. Politicians aren’t just parroting soundbites -they’re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed. That’s why uranium is behaving the way it is. This isn’t a retail meme rally. This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints. The market was suppressed. Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress. Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it. If they were just talking, prices wouldn’t care. But this is action. And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up. Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history (outside of bitcoin) and you all are sleeping.

      "selftext_processed": "Yesterday I posted on the true meaning of Venezeula to energy security specifically to Uranium Rare Earths . I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days . Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand . Check this Uranium isn ’ t ripping because of headlines . It ’ s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action . For years the narrative was “ renewables can do it ” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible . That was suppression . Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression . Inventories got drained . Mines stayed closed . Licensing stayed slow . Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing . Now you ’ re seeing the change . Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing deployment and implementation of nuclear energy policies . That hearing isn ’ t symbolic it ’ s strategic . Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can ’ t meet AI and industrial demand any other way . ￼ This isn ’ t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point . This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog . That ’ s the kind of governmentlevel pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security . ￼ You can see markets already moving on this . NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn ’ t just talk congressional heat makes it more real . ￼ All the antinuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue . AI energy demand exposed the grid ’ s limitations and the same committee that has talked about AI ’ s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes . ￼ This is the political backing that breaks suppression . When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year that signals policy momentum not_posturing . Politicians aren ’ t just parroting soundbites they ’ re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed . That ’ s why uranium is behaving the way it is . This isn ’ t a retail meme rally . This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints . The market was suppressed . Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress . Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it . If they were just talking prices wouldn ’ t care . But this is action . And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up . Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history outside of bitcoin and you all are sleeping .

      "selftext": "Although this outcome isn't guaranteed, it's absolutely certain that markets would react swiftly to this announcement, which is due within the next few months (possibly even days or weeks). It stands to reason that if tariffs are overturned, importers would benefit significantly. This is because they won't be subject to import fees and will be able to either lower their prices and gain market share, or keep current maintain market share and lower their overhead costs. This includes retailers like Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), as well as tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA). Similarly, domestic manufacturing like Nucor steel (NUE) and United States Steel (X) would suffer from this ruling. This is because they will suffer from higher operating costs and will loose profit margins, or ultimately loose market share due to these higher costs. Others I think will vary over time. For example, Caterpillar (CAT) might suffer initially since they manufature in the US, but they might gain long term due to lower capital overhead. I think these are all reasonable bets, but who do you think stands to benefit or loose the most? Which stocks would be the most timely to purchase based on other factors? I'm interested mostly in purchasing rather than shorting, but would enjoy takes on both long term and short term gains.",

It stands to reason that if tariffs are overturned importers would benefit significantly . This is because they wont be subject to import fees and will be able to either lower their prices and gain market share or keep current maintain market share and lower their overhead costs . This includes retailers like Walmart WMT Best Buy BBY as well as tech stocks like Apple AAPL Intel INTC and Nvidia NVDA . Similarly domestic manufacturing like Nucor steel NUE and United States Steel X would suffer from this ruling . This is because they will suffer from higher operating costs and will loose profit margins or ultimately loose market share due to these higher costs . Others I think will vary over time . For example Caterpillar CAT might suffer initially since they manufature in the US but they might gain long term due to lower capital overhead . I think these are all reasonable bets but who do you think stands to benefit or loose the most Which stocks would be the most timely to purchase based on other factors Im interested mostly in purchasing rather than shorting but would enjoy takes on both long term and short term gains ."

A great windfall for sure. But it got me thinking-how could I do something similar for my daughter? What would be the best vehicle to accomplish this. I obviously don’t expect the same returns as Richard gained on the investment for Lorelai. I, after all, am not a Yale alumnus (lowly state school offspring here) and am not known for making the best picks in the market. I have since distilled my portfolio down into an extremely boring albeit stable mix of stocks and practice DCA. Anyways, how could I go about doing this for my daughter?

      "selftext": "Phillips 66 (PSX) has announced its agreement to acquire the Lindsay Refinery assets and related infrastructure in the UK. This move is set to bolster their operations, especially as they integrate the assets into their Humber Refinery. The company has stated that after thorough evaluations, it decided not to restart Lindsay’s independent operations due to scale and operational constraints. Instead, Phillips 66 will incorporate these assets into its existing refinery system, potentially leading to improved efficiency and synergies. With this acquisition, Phillips 66 is making strategic moves to strengthen its position in the energy sector and diversify its operations. The decision not to revive Lindsay as an independent refinery seems prudent, as it could streamline operations and avoid the risk of a costly restart. Given the broader push towards sustainable fuels and Phillips 66's strong presence in the refining market, this could be a good time to consider adding PSX to your portfolio. Do you think this acquisition will positively impact PSX’s long term growth and stock performance?",

      "title": "SEZL is the BEST setup for 2026: Flipping the Script on BNPL",
      "selftext": "TLDR: Sezzle (SEZL) is one of the best setup stocks going into 2026. \\~15 Forward P/E for 2026 w earnings growing \\~30%. Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.** It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76% while maintaining 28% net income margins, and it is even rarer to find it trading at just \\~14x forward earnings. Sezzle (SEZL) is that company. Sezzle provides flexible, consumer focused ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ financing and credit-building tools specifically designed for the underserved market. While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise, Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy, pivoting to a high-LTV subscription model that self-funds its own expansion. The setup here looks very attractive. You have a founder-CEO, Charlie, who has his entire net worth in the company, owning roughly 44%, 2.4 million pre-split shares (approx. 14.4m post split), and has never sold a share… plus, he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger: # BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most, I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards, but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can’t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28% as a standard when it used to be like 12-15%. The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing. Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything. If you polled me, nearly 100% of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection, travel rewards, etc. Unlike a credit card, SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance. They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice. # Consumer-Sided vs. Merchant-Sided A few years ago, Sezzle switched from the typical “merchant-sided” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller, to a consumer-sided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm. SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumer-friendly, consumer driven experience. They charge the consumer. SEZL’s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool - accessible, budget flexibility, and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure. The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing - offering promos, price comparisons, featured products etc. **Merchant Sided**: Driven by merchant access and promotion. Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself. **Consumer Sided**: SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer. It is consumer-driven rather than merchant-driven. Because of this, Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer. Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted, rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted. Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items. Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 6-12-24 month plans and interest. They do offer the traditional pay-in-4 but its focus is higher ticket. This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL’s. # Customer Sezzle targets subprime and near-prime consumers, a bit more ‘risky’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL. They utilize AI and new infrastructure to risk-assess users that traditional banks reject. SEZL allows users to opt-in for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up. They reward responsible use with increased access, but they have strict usage limits, you cannot use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance. Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $3,500 limit immediately, Sezzle starts with micro approvals of \\~$50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage. The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks, not a way to rack up revolving debt at 28% APR. SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary non-FICO approval methods, monitoring, limits etc.. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not - if it’s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times. # Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth, prioritizing profitable growth strategies. One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses. They pride themselves on it to expand leverage. They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money. On the calls I’ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘expansion’ In Q2 Management recently noted: “With top line growth of 76% YoY, gross margins of 61% and a net income margin of 28%, we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version, the Rule of 100, where we scored a 165 this quarter.” **History of Raising Guidance**: Split-adjusted guidance for FY24 started at $2.00. It moved to $2.50-$3.00, then $3.25, and recently to $3.52. Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $4.35. **Valuation\\*:** We are looking at a \\~18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS. **PEG Ratio:** SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60. For reference, a PEG of <1 is generally considered undervalued. (PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio by its expected earnings growth rate, adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings.) NOTE: the drop in Sezzle’s (SEZL) Q2 2025 TTM (Trailing Twelve Month) EPS drop is primarily due to a **one-time significant tax benefit in Q2 2024** rolling off the twelve-month calculation. **Operating Income actually grew by 116%** year-over-year (from $16.7M in Q2 ‘24 to $36.1M in Q2 ‘25). Underlying SEZL’s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers. As of Q3, SEZL reports a cash position of $134.7m vs $118m in debt for a net cash position of $16.7m and a healthy Total Debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.76. In addition, the company recently expanded its credit facility to $225m. With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90%, SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow. While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable, Klarna has shifted back to a net loss. Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency, a \\~36% Operating Margin and \\~27% Net Income Margin, providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its high-volume, thin-margin competitors do not possess. Additionally, SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility. To highlight SEZL’s focus on profitability, it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks. This is not the case with SEZL, despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58%, they continue to post positive cash flow. SEZL’s short payback period of 4-6 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn. They are successfully self-funding their 58% GMV growth. # Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good. There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1%, but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don’t have a history with the company, it’s almost like a CAC/marketing expense. Charlie clarified it’s right where they anticipate though, that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers, but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year. He basically said ‘we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4, that should be understood.’ I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out. Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7% Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY.

GMV grew 58.7% Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY **Why is Revenue growing at >60% but active consumers by 12%?** Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL. The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions. It’s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens - 67% vs 48%. Last quarter it was 62% YoY MODS (monthly on demand and subs). They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster. They noticed the conversion wasn’t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward, noted as a reason for growth change. Refocusing on prioritizing subs. On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand. In addition - SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth. They stress it on all the calls. Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc. so there will likely be a spike in user growth. I think of Active consumers as “the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle” - this pool was built with growth/exposure first in mind - and then they try to transition them into subscribers - growing the pool of high value long term value consumers. So the “active users” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer. The gap remains 2971-784=2,187 Active Users that are not MODS/Subscribers. MODS is currently 26% of actives. Last year Q3 it was 19.8%. So they are eating into this pie, converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth. Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions, more transactions (avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x). Also, the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10% but GMV grows 20% the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees. GMV grew 58.7%, subscribers made 10x more transactions, and there is cross selling new products (fee for credit building product etc). SEZL’s Formula for Leveraged Growth: Base consumer growth + conversion to high value subscribers + cross selling products to increase customer LTV + increase usage/GMV + growing take rate = fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth. Take rate is 11.2%, increasing 60bps YoY. With a pivot to higher-margin subscriptions (MODS), a growing take rate (\\~13%), and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast, I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound. # Q4/Q1 Accounting It is important to note, SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations. There were previous sell-offs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this. **Q4:** In Holiday seasons there is typically **a m**assive GMV spike. Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk. This depresses the net income for the Q. **Following Q1,** Revenue is recognized when paid (fees/payments). Since Sezzle is a a 4-6 week BNPL payoff, the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1. Q1 often shows lower GMV but all-time high Revenue. GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not recognize the revenue until Q1. This creates weird QoQ comparisons, but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue, gross margins remain north of 60%. # Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lenders/BNPLs. This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines. IMO, BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those long-term debts. Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products, but in the short term I think the impact is different. BNPL is very short term in nature - particularly SEZL - and as management would argue, they are “more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks,” rather than a traditional credit product. 1. It’s much easier to pay $120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $500 car loan or $300 student loan. 2. Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term. 4 $30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $300 and $500 payment monthly for 12-36-indefinite months. 3. BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable. 4. There is almost an anti-student loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness. 5. BNPL can also be a symptom/result of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted, maxed, or unavailable. And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not allow follow up loans without payoff. Ultimately - i am not arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now. I believe there’s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like cars/student loans. Also - pulling from an old Value Investors Club write-up on SEZL, the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that: “Sezzle is not afraid of a recession. Their customer is already in distress. Moreover, they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad. Because Sezzle’s target is subprime customer they are not afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Pay-in-4 as competition.” Nonetheless, despite my above points, there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs. A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation. SEZL’s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such, if customer spending contracts, revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate. And while SEZL’s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.5-3% range, a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test. Fortunately, because of wide-spread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space, I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL’s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk. If you are interested in SEZL, I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential, but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile. At these valuations SEZZLE is setup to be a potential multibagger. **ALSO - CFPB agrees BNPL negative sentiment is overstated:** The CFPB finds that \"BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products.\" BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting. Charge-offs went back to 2020 stimulus-check era lows, but lenders noted the decrease is driven by \"improved credit models\" and \"shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers.\" This is SEZL exact model. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.** EDIT: position",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Sezzle SEZL is one of the best setup stocks going into 2026 . 15 Forward PE for 2026 w earnings growing 30 % . Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through . I own SEZL and am buying at these levels . It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76 % while maintaining 28 % net income margins and it is even rarer to find it trading at just 14x forward earnings . Sezzle SEZL is that company . Sezzle provides flexible consumer focused ‘ Buy Now Pay Later ’ financing and creditbuilding tools specifically designed for the underserved market . While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy pivoting to a highLTV subscription model that selffunds its own expansion . The setup here looks very attractive . You have a founderCEO Charlie who has his entire net worth in the company owning roughly 44 % 2.4 million presplit shares approx . 14.4m post split and has never_sold a share… plus he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can ’ t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28 % as a standard when it used to be like 1215 % . The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing . Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything . If you polled me nearly 100 % of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection travel rewards etc . Unlike a credit card SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance . They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice . ConsumerSided vs. MerchantSided A few years ago Sezzle switched from the typical “ merchantsided ” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller to a consumersided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm . SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumerfriendly consumer driven experience . They charge the consumer . SEZL ’ s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool accessible budget flexibility and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure . The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing offering promos price comparisons featured products etc . Merchant Sided Driven by merchant access and promotion . Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself . Consumer Sided SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer . It is consumerdriven rather than merchantdriven . Because of this Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer . Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted . Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items . Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 61224 month plans and interest . They do offer the traditional payin4 but its focus is higher ticket . This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL ’ s . Customer Sezzle targets subprime and nearprime consumers a bit more ‘ risky ’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL . They utilize AI and new infrastructure to riskassess users that traditional banks reject . SEZL allows users to optin for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up . They reward responsible use with increased access but they have strict usage limits you can not use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance . Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $ 3500 limit immediately Sezzle starts with micro approvals of $ 50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage . The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks not_a way to rack up revolving debt at 28 % APR . SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary nonFICO approval methods monitoring limits etc .. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not_ if it ’ s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times . Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth prioritizing profitable growth strategies . One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses . They pride themselves on it to expand leverage . They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money . On the calls I ’ ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘ expansion ’ In Q2 Management recently noted “ With top line growth of 76 % YoY gross margins of 61 % and a net income margin of 28 % we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version the Rule of 100 where we scored a 165 this quarter. ” History of Raising Guidance Splitadjusted guidance for FY24 started at $ 2.00 . It moved to $ 2.50 $ 3.00 then $ 3.25 and recently to $ 3.52 . Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $ 4.35 . Valuation We are looking at a 18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS . PEG Ratio SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60 . For reference a PEG of 1 is generally considered undervalued . PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock ’ s PricetoEarnings PE ratio by its expected earnings growth rate adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings . NOTE the drop in Sezzle ’ s SEZL Q2 2025 TTM Trailing Twelve Month EPS drop is primarily due to a onetime significant tax benefit in Q2 2024 rolling off the twelvemonth calculation . Operating Income actually grew by 116 % yearoveryear from $ 16.7M in Q2 ‘ 24 to $ 36.1M in Q2 ‘ 25 . Underlying SEZL ’ s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers . As of Q3 SEZL reports a cash position of $ 134.7m vs $ 118m in debt for a net cash position of $ 16.7m and a healthy Total DebtEBITDA ratio of 0.76 . In addition the company recently expanded its credit facility to $ 225m . With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90 % SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow . While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable Klarna has shifted back to a net loss . Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency a 36 % Operating Margin and 27 % Net Income Margin providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its highvolume thinmargin competitors do not_possess . Additionally SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility . To highlight SEZL ’ s focus on profitability it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks . This is not_the case with SEZL despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58 % they continue to post positive cash flow . SEZL ’ s short payback period of 46 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn . They are successfully selffunding their 58 % GMV growth . Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good . There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1 % but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don ’ t have a history with the company it ’ s almost like a CACmarketing expense . Charlie clarified it ’ s right where they anticipate though that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year . He basically said ‘ we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4 that should be understood. ’ I also don ’ t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions I ’ d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out . Monthly On Demand and Subs MODS grew 48 % YoY Active consumers grew 11.4 % . GMV grew 58.7 % Revenue grew 67 % YoY and adjusted net income was $ 25.4M this quarter up 53 % YoY . I also don ’ t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions I ’ d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out . Monthly On Demand and Subs MODS grew 48 % YoY Active consumers grew 11.4 % . GMV grew 58.7 % Revenue grew 67 % YoY and adjusted net income was $ 25.4M this quarter up 53 % YoY Why is Revenue growing at 60 % but active consumers by 12 % Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL . The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions . It ’ s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens 67 % vs 48 % . Last quarter it was 62 % YoY MODS monthly on demand and subs . They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster . They noticed the conversion wasn ’ t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward noted as a reason for growth change . Refocusing on prioritizing subs . On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand . In addition SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth . They stress it on all the calls . Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc . so there will likely be a spike in user growth . I think of Active consumers as “ the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle ” this pool was built with growthexposure first in mind and then they try to transition them into subscribers growing the pool of high value long term value consumers . So the “ active users ” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer . The gap remains 29717842187 Active Users that are not_MODSSubscribers . MODS is currently 26 % of actives . Last year Q3 it was 19.8 % . So they are eating into this pie converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth . Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions more transactions avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x . Also the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10 % but GMV grows 20 % the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees . GMV grew 58.7 % subscribers made 10x more transactions and there is cross selling new products fee for credit building product etc . SEZL ’ s Formula for Leveraged Growth Base consumer growth conversion to high value subscribers cross selling products to increase customer LTV increase usageGMV growing take rate fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth . Take rate is 11.2 % increasing 60bps YoY . With a pivot to highermargin subscriptions MODS a growing take rate 13 % and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound . Q4Q1 Accounting It is important to note SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations . There were previous selloffs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this . Q4 In Holiday seasons there is typically a massive GMV spike . Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk . This depresses the net income for the Q . Following Q1 Revenue is recognized when paid feespayments . Since Sezzle is a a 46 week BNPL payoff the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1 . Q1 often shows lower GMV but alltime high Revenue . GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not_recognize the revenue until Q1 . This creates weird QoQ comparisons but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue gross margins remain north of 60 % . Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lendersBNPLs . This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines . IMO BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those longterm debts . Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products but in the short term I think the impact is different . BNPL is very short term in nature particularly SEZL and as management would argue they are “ more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks ” rather than a traditional credit product . 1 . It ’ s much easier to pay $ 120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $ 500 car loan or $ 300 student loan . 2 . Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term . 4 $ 30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $ 300 and $ 500 payment monthly for 1236indefinite months . 3 . BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $ X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable . 4 . There is almost an antistudent loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness . 5 . BNPL can also be a symptomresult of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted maxed or unavailable . And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not_allow follow up loans without payoff . Ultimately i am not_arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now . I believe there ’ s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like carsstudent loans . Also pulling from an old Value Investors Club writeup on SEZL the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that “ Sezzle is not_afraid of a recession . Their customer is already in distress . Moreover they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad . Because Sezzle ’ s target is subprime customer they are not_afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Payin4 as competition. ” Nonetheless despite my above points there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs . A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation . SEZL ’ s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such if customer spending contracts revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate . And while SEZL ’ s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.53 % range a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test . Fortunately because of widespread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL ’ s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk . If you are interested in SEZL I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile . At these valuations SEZZLE is setup to be a potential multibagger . ALSO CFPB agrees BNPL negative sentiment is overstated The CFPB finds that BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products . BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting . Chargeoffs went back to 2020 stimuluscheck era lows but lenders noted the decrease is driven by improved credit models and shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers . This is SEZL exact model . I own SEZL and am buying at these levels . EDIT position"

      "selftext": "2025 was a very fruitful year for me. All three major stock indices rose, with the Nasdaq Composite performing best, gaining 25%-30% for the year, significantly outperforming the broader market and ultimately emerging as the winner. If you had chosen a stock from this index and held it for a year, the probability of profit would have been as high as 70%. If you held a portfolio of stocks from Nvidia, Intel, or other semiconductor companies, the return would have exceeded 40%. How did your stock portfolio perform? Of course, 2025 was also a lucky year for me. Through discussions with some friends in the investment community, I gained some valuable information and benefited greatly. Therefore, I sold my underperforming stocks and bought some shares of Nvidia, Intel, and AVGO. Although there were some fluctuations, I ultimately achieved a good return. Market news is often more important than technical analysis. I recently learned that the artificial intelligence bubble is expanding, and the market is starting to shift to other industries, which will become new growth points next year. There is a good chance that some new hot stocks will emerge, performing even better than Nvidia. I am still closely monitoring the situation and waiting for the right opportunity.",

All three major stock indices rose with the Nasdaq Composite performing best gaining 25 % 30 % for the year significantly outperforming the broader market and ultimately emerging as the winner . If you had chosen a stock from this index and held it for a year the probability of profit would have been as high as 70 % . If you held a portfolio of stocks from Nvidia Intel or other semiconductor companies the return would have exceeded 40 % . How did your stock portfolio perform Of course 2025 was also a lucky year for me . Through discussions with some friends in the investment community I gained some valuable information and benefited greatly . Therefore I sold my underperforming stocks and bought some shares of Nvidia Intel and AVGO . Although there were some fluctuations I ultimately achieved a good return . Market news is often more important than technical analysis . I recently learned that the artificial intelligence bubble is expanding and the market is starting to shift to other industries which will become new growth points next year . There is a good chance that some new hot stocks will emerge performing even better than Nvidia . I am still closely monitoring the situation and waiting for the right opportunity ."

A lot of SemiCab's traction has been in India, and many U.S. market participants discount overseas execution even when the customers are large and the contracts expand. I see this all the time with microcaps: international wins get treated like \"nice, but does it work in the U.S.?\" even when the economics are already meaningful. The Dec 22, 2025 recap laid out specific examples that look hard to dismiss. The company reported five new contract wins in 2025 with large FMCG customers in India and six contract expansions with lane and trip volume increases ranging from 100% to 600% (source type: company press release). The biggest datapoint was an Asian Paints expansion cited at $6M, described as the largest in SemiCab history, and it increased active lanes from 25 to 183. The release also notes Asian Paints has over $4B in annual sales, which gives context on customer size (source type: company press release). Management also stated SemiCab ARR increased 220% from $2.5M in January to over $8M by December and cited a forward-looking ARR of $15M based on current contracts and expansions (source type: company press release). If that run-rate is being built on expansion behavior in one geography, the question becomes whether the same playbook transfers to the U.S. through Apex. Do your own research.",

      "selftext": "Now that 2025 has wrapped up, it’s interesting to see how different markets performed, it was really goof for US stocks, especially large caps and tech, though many international markets actually delivered stronger returns overall, In other trading news, tokenized stocks are gaining traction, for example, Bitget recently recorded around $1 B in trading volume for these products, these shows there is growing interest in alternative ways to access equities. Looking closer, the MSCI All Country World ex‑USA index, which tracks global stocks outside the US, returned roughly 29 % in 2025, ahead of the S&P 500’s gain of around 16 %, A weaker US dollar also helped boost the dollar adjusted returns of foreign markets, Asian markets, in particular saw notable strength, with South Korea’s KOSPI surging and tech heavy companie leading the way, European indices also posted solid double digit gains across Spain, Italy, Germany, and the UK. So while US equities did well, the broader picture shows that global markets outside the US led last year, With trends like international gains and growing adoption of tokenized stocks, it’s worth thinking about how diversification might play into portfolio decisions in 2026.",

      "selftext_processed": "Now that 2025 has wrapped up it ’ s interesting to see how different markets performed it was really goof for US stocks especially large caps and tech though many international markets actually delivered stronger returns overall In other trading news tokenized stocks are gaining traction for example Bitget recently recorded around $ 1 B in trading volume for these products these shows there is growing interest in alternative ways to access equities . Looking closer the MSCI All Country World ex‑USA index which tracks global stocks outside the US returned roughly 29 % in 2025 ahead of the SP 500 ’ s gain of around 16 % A weaker US dollar also helped boost the dollar adjusted returns of foreign markets Asian markets in particular saw notable strength with South Korea ’ s KOSPI surging and tech heavy companie leading the way European indices also posted solid double digit gains across Spain Italy Germany and the UK . So while US equities did well the broader picture shows that global markets outside the US led last year With trends like international gains and growing adoption of tokenized stocks it ’ s worth thinking about how diversification might play into portfolio decisions in 2026 ."

The robotaxi ecosystem will evolve: AV companies provide the tech, global platforms like Uber handle the rest. Robotaxis is not any kind of segment can flip a switch overnight, they will be layered into existing platforms. WePilot 3.0, a system of WeRide's end-to-end ADAS stack, they're building optionality across autonomy level that can help reducing the risks while keeping upside.

      "selftext": "{this is a short term play, im not \"investing\" in oil to see how this disaster plays out in 10 years} During the press conference yesterday Trump said: “We are going to be running it \\[Venezuela\\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure” *Source:* [Youtube]( Timestamp: 37:25 **1) For those who weren't around in 2007, quick history** In 2007, Hugo Chávez forced foreign oil companies into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures. PDVSA is the Venezuelan state oil company. Foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave. For the US this meant: * ExxonMobil refused. Assets in the Orinoco Belt were expropriated. Years of arbitration followed. * ConocoPhillips refused. Same outcome. Large projects seized. * Chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational. *Result*? Production fell from \\~3.2 mbd to well below 1 mbd. **2) What a “rebuild” actually looks like** This is not about new mega-projects. It starts with fixing what already exists. Workovers on shut-in wells. Pipeline repairs and leak control. Stabilizing heavy crude upgraders. Restoring export terminals. + Venezuelan crude is extra-heavy. You cannot produce it without services, chemicals, and constant intervention. **3) Who makes money first?** * **Phase 1:** Oilfield services. Short contracts. Fast cash flow. Low political risk. * **Phase 2:** Operators with existing licenses and assets. * **Phase 3:** Majors that demand long-term legal certainty. **Where I put my money** *Phase 1*: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes *Phase 2*: Chevron *Phase 3*: ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil **Doubts:** Isn't this all a bit *premature*? Yes, absolutely, but the stock market doesnt let you wait until it's all said and done. Isn't it *late* already? Maybe, all these companies are already up ±2-10% premarket. But I'd say it's still early. About Phase 3 players I’m unsure how they will react. They will want their settlements but I doubt Trump will give them any without joining the rebuild. I guess they’d be repaid by grants for rebuilding. But I’m unsure. The uncertainty is why I put them 3rd. Maybe one of you guys has better theories. Do with this as you will. I'm in and shared my view. happy to see yours. ⸻ **TL;DR** Trump said: “We are going to be running it \\[Venezuela\\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure”. A rebuild starts with repairs, not new oil dreams. Oilfield services get paid first, Chevron benefits next. Exxon and Conoco are optional upside, not the core play. Might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but I'm in. My bet is on: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Chevron for now.",

Worst decision ever, now I’m down to about 3.5k and I’m stuck wondering if I should pull it out at a loss and pay off what I can, or just hold. I’m 21 and started investing when I was 19. I bought PLTR, SOFI, NVIDIA, and some other solid stuff around May 2023 and honestly thought I was just a great investor. Then I had to sell at a decent profit to buy a car for college. I started again recently after saving up some money. Normally I just pay off my cards, but I had the “genius” idea to throw it into the market, make a shit ton, and then wipe out the debt and keep the difference. Clearly that didn’t work and the logic was retarded.

Quanta Services (PWR) is the uncorker. They don’t build the AI chips. They don’t run the servers. They build the stuff that powers the stuff. Transmission lines. Substations. Underground cables. If electrons need to move from point A to point B, Quanta builds the road. Why them? Scale. The grid is fragmented. Most repair crews are local mom-and-pops. Quanta is massive. They have the labor force. They have the equipment. They can deploy an army of linemen anywhere in the country. Utilities are panicking. They need to upgrade now. They are boosting spending by 25-30% over the next three years. They can’t do it alone. They call Quanta. The proof is in the backlog. They have nearly \\~$40B in signed contracts. That’s not “maybe” money. That’s “we are doing this” money. The numbers (Q3 2025)... Market cap: \\~$64B Revenue: $7.6B (up 17.5% vs last year) Adjusted EPS: $3.33 52-week high: \\~$469 52-week low: \\~$227 The risks... It’s not cheap. You’re paying a premium for that growth. If the AI hype cools, the stock does too. Weather delays projects. Regulations slow things down. Bottom line... The AI boom is real. But it hits a wall without power. Quanta is the sledgehammer breaking down that wall. As long as data centers need juice, Quanta has work to do. Anyone else keeping an eye on this one and why? Dan from Money Machine Newsletter",

      "selftext": "I’m 26 years old in grad school. My portfolio is made up of a weekly ROTH contribution that looks like this: 1. SCHG - 26$ 2. Tesla - 19$ 3. Amazon - 10$ 4. QQI - 10$ 5. Microsoft - 9$ 6. Visa - 9$ 7. Palantir - 8$ 8.Microstrategy - 5$ 9. Nividia - 5$ 10. ASML - 5$ 11. VTI - 5$ 12. CIBR - 5$ 13. Cash - 12$ Total allocated weekly 113$ with 12$ cash reserve (roughly 10%) I had to pause my contributions over the summer as I was saving for equipment I needed for school. With that pause I had 2,750$ left over for the 2025 fiscal year. I have already caught back up and contributed that money to my Roth making it the 2nd time I maxed it out in a row! Super pumped but now I have questions as to how I will bleed this extra money into the market while still contributing my automatic buys for 2026 fiscal year. My plan is listed below: I want to bleed extra money into the market over a span of 6 months or 26 weeks 2,750 total “extra” contributions 250$ cash reserve 2,500$ stocks 2,500 / 26 =96.154 extra a week I have to allocate My top conviction plays in my opinion are 1. Tesla 2. SCHG 3. Microsoft 4. Microstrategy 5. VTI My question is how I should allocate the extra money? I have an idea of splitting it between the 5 companies but want an outsiders opinion. Personally with those 5 plays I would add (EXTRA) 1. 25$ to Tesla 2. 20$ to SCHG 3. 20$ to Microsoft 4. 15$ to Microstrategy 5. 16$ to VTI Or something like that. What’s the move chat?",

Cash 12 $ Total allocated weekly 113 $ with 12 $ cash reserve roughly 10 % I had to pause my contributions over the summer as I was saving for equipment I needed for school . With that pause I had 2750 $ left over for the 2025 fiscal year . I have already caught back up and contributed that money to my Roth making it the 2nd time I maxed it out in a row Super pumped but now I have questions as to how I will bleed this extra money into the market while still contributing my automatic buys for 2026 fiscal year . My plan is listed below I want to bleed extra money into the market over a span of 6 months or 26 weeks 2750 total “ extra ” contributions 250 $ cash reserve 2500 $ stocks 2500 26 96.154 extra a week I have to allocate My top conviction plays in my opinion are 1 . Tesla 2 . SCHG 3 . Microsoft 4 . Microstrategy 5 . VTI My question is how I should allocate the extra money I have an idea of splitting it between the 5 companies but want an outsiders opinion . Personally with those 5 plays I would add EXTRA 1 . 25 $ to Tesla 2 . 20 $ to SCHG 3 . 20 $ to Microsoft 4 . 15 $ to Microstrategy 5 . 16 $ to VTI Or something like that . What ’ s the move chat"

      "selftext": "The year was 2015. I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per) During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?” Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. It has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel to hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day. I’m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house, cars, investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA. Trading and more specifically, Nvidia, changed my entire life. Proudly riding with Jensen",

      "selftext_processed": "The year was 2015 . I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school . The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers . I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k . I remember buying Macys Hecla Mining and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better . I was over trading like a mad man . This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7 $ per trade during those days . Just young and dumb not_really making any money . Wasting company time so no_harm no_foul . In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k . Which was basically my life savings at that point in time . I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia . Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes . A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary yes even at that time . I found his aspirations of self driving AI robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape . I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk . I remember talking to my father in law about it . “ What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia ” Too many eggs in one basket was his response . I ended up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia . As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could . $ 200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares . It has been a great ride since then . There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares . It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel to hold this long . So much bullshit Crypto winter Andrew Left short selling attacks Covid selloffs deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day . I ’ m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house cars investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA .

      "title": "[UPDATE] $GT Goodyear Tires: Maduro's Capture Stock Analysis",
      "selftext": "[**Initial DD here**]( ***Note:*** *I've been away on vacation so not much time for new full DDs yet. As to my previous post, I'll be researching and writing up on PayPal (most upvotes). As of now, PYPL is not a long, I am looking into whether its a short or a hold, more information to come.* ==================================================================== We recently got news of Maduro's capture by the US, and this is very economically important, and it's extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market. **Background:** *Note: Use of AI to research & write the sanction background summary. (Reviewed by me)* **2018** * The Trump administration **expanded financial sanctions** on Venezuela. * New executive orders **banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt** and blocked dealings with Venezuela’s **state-issued digital currency (the “petro”)**. * Goal: **cut off new financing** to Nicolás Maduro’s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally. **2019** * January\\*\\*:\\*\\* The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil company, effectively **blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil** and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S. * August\\*\\*:\\*\\* The U.S. **froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States** and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro. * Impact: Venezuela’s **oil exports and government revenues collapsed**, making 2019 the most severe sanctions year. ==================================================================== **Goodyear Tires ($GT) Update:** **December 10, 2018:** Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions. They locked the gates and laid off the workforce. (1,160 employees) **December 11, 2018 (The Seizure):** The Maduro regime declared Goodyear's closure \"illegal\" and an act of \"sabotage.\" The government invoked labor laws to immediately \"occupy\" and take control of the facility in Valencia, promising to restart production under state management. In a famous detail from the 2018 exit, Goodyear gave each laid-off employee **10 tires** as part of their severance package because the currency (Bolívar) was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money. *(AI)* If the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant, Goodyear gains a fully-constructed industrial facility. Even if it requires $100M in refurbishment, reclaiming a facility with a value of \\~$500M+ is a huge gain for Goodyear, so I'll try to quantify this the best I can. Before the complete economic collapse, Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America. We can look at 2014-2015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain. * In 2014, despite early signs of crisis, Goodyear Venezuela generated **$119 million in Operating Income**. * In 2015, Venezuela accounted for **33% of Latin America’s net sales that year,** up from 16% in 2014, despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession. * At the time of the 2018 seizure, union leaders reported the plant was producing **10,500 tires per day** while running at only **20% capacity**. * This implies a full capacity of 52,500 tires/day or 19m tires/yr (LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013) Its pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream, particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime, would represent a massive gain for Goodyear’s current shareholders. **The Valencia Plant** On September 16, 2025, the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million (approximately $32 million) to \"reactivate and modernize\" the Valencia plant. This investment was directed toward: 1. Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems. 2. Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle state-of-the-art machinery. 3. Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards. 4. Modernization of curing and extrusion set-points to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs. It is likely focused on the most critical failure points, curing presses and Banbury mixers. If this plant was worth \\~$USD600m in 2018, it was state-of-the art at the time, ill conservatively (see note below) estimate \\~200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013's demand alone. The capital saved by not having to build a greenfield site (a process that would take 24–36 months) allows Goodyear to quickly capture the post-war demand surge while advancing the Goodyear Forward goal of debt reduction. *Note: Honestly, I could research further into this and get exact numbers by comparing precedent factory investments/projects from $GT and competitors to try and estimate how much investment would be needed to return this 7-Year old factory into what is needed for $GT's tires. Unfortunately, I'm writing this up on a Sunday and that'd probably take more time than I'm willing to put in for a marginal gain in thesis confidence.* **Venezuelan Supply for Tire inputs** Raw material costs typically account for 60% of total production expenses, while energy consumption during the vulcanization and curing cycles adds another 15–20%. The Venezuelan industrial corridor offers several unique advantages that could make the Valencia plant one of the lowest-cost producers in Goodyear’s global portfolio. Goodyear’s Valencia plant is located in close proximity to Negroven S.A., a carbon black producer with an installed capacity of 70,000 metric tons per year. Carbon black is a critical reinforcing filler in rubber mixtures, and Negroven has remained operational throughout the crisis, continuing to export to international markets as recently as December 19, 2025. The availability of local carbon black eliminates significant logistics costs and import duties that affect other regional plants in Brazil or Colombia. The Trump administration’s stated goal is to \"get the oil flowing\" by deploying major U.S. oil companies to fix the country’s broken infrastructure. This revival of the domestic petroleum industry, which has seen production stagnate at around 800,000–900,000 barrels per day despite a potential for 2 million+, will provide Goodyear with a direct source of petrochemicals required for synthetic rubber and high-temperature polymers used in tire tread inserts. The involvement of Chevron and other majors ensures that the processing facilities will be modernized, reducing the volatility of chemical feedstocks for the Valencia Plant. Tire manufacturing is exceptionally energy-intensive. The Guri Dam hydroelectric system provides the vast majority of Venezuela’s power. While the system has faced threats of sabotage and neglect, the Transition Governing Council has identified the securement and establishment of technical oversight for the Guri Dam as an immediate priority to prevent total electrical blackouts. A stable, low-cost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossil-fuel-based electricity or unreliable grids. **There are several demand drivers that I'm happy to further discuss if not obvious that will fuel a catch-up phase in Venezuela and LATAM** If the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $119 million on only partial capacity, a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $250 million to $300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028. **TLDR:** A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $GT and completes the initial thesis. As this continues to develop, we may see incremental $USD250-300mm gain in operating income within 2 years.",

      "selftext_processed": "Initial DD here Note Ive been away on vacation so not_much time for new full DDs yet . As to my previous post Ill be researching and writing up on PayPal most upvotes . As of now PYPL is not_a long I am looking into whether its a short or a hold more information to come . We recently got news of Maduros capture by the US and this is very economically important and its extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market . Background Note Use of AI to research write the sanction background summary . Reviewed by me 2018 The Trump administration expanded financial sanctions on Venezuela . New executive orders banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt and blocked dealings with Venezuela ’ s stateissued digital currency the “ petro ” . Goal cut off new financing to Nicolás Maduro ’ s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally . 2019 January The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA Venezuela ’ s state oil company effectively blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S. August The U.S. froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro . Impact Venezuela ’ s oil exports and government revenues collapsed making 2019 the most severe sanctions year . Goodyear Tires $ GT Update December 10 2018 Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions . They locked the gates and laid off the workforce . 1160 employees December 11 2018 The Seizure The Maduro regime declared Goodyears closure illegal and an act of sabotage . The government invoked labor laws to immediately occupy and take control of the facility in Valencia promising to restart production under state management . In a famous detail from the 2018 exit Goodyear gave each laidoff employee 10 tires as part of their severance package because the currency Bolívar was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money . AI If the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant Goodyear gains a fullyconstructed industrial facility . Even if it requires $ 100M in refurbishment reclaiming a facility with a value of $ 500M is a huge gain for Goodyear so Ill try to quantify this the best I can . Before the complete economic collapse Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America . We can look at 20142015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain . In 2014 despite early signs of crisis Goodyear Venezuela generated $ 119 million in Operating Income . In 2015 Venezuela accounted for 33 % of Latin America ’ s net sales that year up from 16 % in 2014 despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession . At the time of the 2018 seizure union leaders reported the plant was producing 10500 tires per day while running at only 20 % capacity . This implies a full capacity of 52500 tiresday or 19m tiresyr LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013 Its pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime would represent a massive gain for Goodyear ’ s current shareholders . The Valencia Plant On September 16 2025 the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million approximately $ 32 million to reactivate and modernize the Valencia plant . This investment was directed toward 1 . Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems . 2 . Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle stateoftheart machinery . 3 . Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards . 4 . Modernization of curing and extrusion setpoints to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs . It is likely focused on the most critical failure points curing presses and Banbury mixers . If this plant was worth $ USD600m in 2018 it was stateofthe art at the time ill conservatively see note below estimate 200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013s demand alone . The capital saved by not_having to build a greenfield site a process that would take 24–36 months allows Goodyear to quickly capture the postwar demand surge while advancing the Goodyear Forward goal of debt reduction . Note Honestly I could research further into this and get exact numbers by comparing precedent factory investmentsprojects from $ GT and competitors to try and estimate how much investment would be needed to return this 7Year old factory into what is needed for $ GTs tires . Unfortunately Im writing this up on a Sunday and thatd probably take more time than Im willing to put in for a marginal gain in thesis confidence . Venezuelan Supply for Tire inputs Raw material costs typically account for 60 % of total production expenses while energy consumption during the vulcanization and curing cycles adds another 15–20 % . The Venezuelan industrial corridor offers several unique advantages that could make the Valencia plant one of the lowestcost producers in Goodyear ’ s global portfolio . Goodyear ’ s Valencia plant is located in close proximity to Negroven S.A. a carbon black producer with an installed capacity of 70000 metric tons per year . Carbon black is a critical reinforcing filler in rubber mixtures and Negroven has remained operational throughout the crisis continuing to export to international markets as recently as December 19 2025 . The availability of local carbon black eliminates significant logistics costs and import duties that affect other regional plants in Brazil or Colombia . The Trump administration ’ s stated goal is to get the oil flowing by deploying major U.S. oil companies to fix the country ’ s broken infrastructure . This revival of the domestic petroleum industry which has seen production stagnate at around 800000–900000 barrels per day despite a potential for 2 million will provide Goodyear with a direct source of petrochemicals required for synthetic rubber and hightemperature polymers used in tire tread inserts . The involvement of Chevron and other majors ensures that the processing facilities will be modernized reducing the volatility of chemical feedstocks for the Valencia Plant . Tire manufacturing is exceptionally energyintensive . The Guri Dam hydroelectric system provides the vast majority of Venezuela ’ s power . While the system has faced threats of sabotage and neglect the Transition Governing Council has identified the securement and establishment of technical oversight for the Guri Dam as an immediate priority to prevent total electrical blackouts . A stable lowcost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossilfuelbased electricity or unreliable grids . There are several demand drivers that Im happy to further discuss if not_obvious that will fuel a catchup phase in Venezuela and LATAM If the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $ 119 million on only partial capacity a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $ 250 million to $ 300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028 . TLDR A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $ GT and completes the initial thesis . As this continues to develop we may see incremental $ USD250300mm gain in operating income within 2 years ."

My thinking is this: Venezuela has huge oil reserves, and if the U.S. ever seriously eases sanctions or expands licenses, their oil industry would need a lot of rebuilding. That wouldn’t be fast, but eventually someone has to do the work. Instead of betting on Venezuela directly, I’m looking at companies around it: – Chevron (CVX) since they’re already involved there – Oilfield service companies like SLB, HAL, BKR if rebuilding actually starts – Gulf Coast refiners like VLO, MPC, PSX that can handle heavy crude if Venezuelan oil comes back What I’m unsure about and want feedback on: – Is this already priced in and I’m late to the idea? – If this ever happens, are we talking months or years before it matters? – Are oilfield service companies a bad idea here because of sanctions, corruption, or not getting paid? – If you were making a small speculative bet like this, would you focus on one angle or avoid it completely? – What would be clear signs that this idea is wrong and I should move on? I’m not trying to get rich quick or act like I know everything. I just want to learn how to think about ideas like this without getting attached to a story in my head.

      "selftext": "For the Fully Paid Loaning / Share Lending programs from brokerages, are people seeing a disparity in rates given vs. rates reported (via Fintel, etc.)? * Forget Robinhood, which shows nothing, and they give you “up to 15% of the weighted average rebate rate ($/share) that Robinhood earned by lending the stock on that day”, so Robinhood pockets 85% of the interest earned, sounds more like the Sheriff of Nottingham… * Etrade seemed to be the opposite, offering much more of the pie (reverse of Robinhood) but it seems now they’re taking half the interest, i.e. whatever interest is reported on Fintel and other sites, the shares on loan are half that. * Schwab seems to be the same as Etrade, again giving half the reported interested for shares on loan. I wouldn’t expect 100% of the reported interest as they’re managing most of the work and risk; but it seems brokerages are keeping the details on interest paid out from share lending intentionally vague so they can do whatever they want (like decide tomorrow they‘ll give you table scraps for your shares instead of an actual portion). This is better than share lending that happened behind the scenes in the past with no income to the actual share owners; but the greed here is ridiculous. Anyone tracking brokerages and which ones are better for investors to participate in share lending? If they all suck, might be worth everyone just shutting off at once on a planned day.

      "selftext_processed": "For the Fully Paid Loaning Share Lending programs from brokerages are people seeing a disparity in rates given vs. rates reported via Fintel etc . Forget Robinhood which shows nothing_and they give you “ up to 15 % of the weighted average rebate rate $ share that Robinhood earned by lending the stock on that day ” so Robinhood pockets 85 % of the interest earned sounds more like the Sheriff of Nottingham… Etrade seemed to be the opposite offering much more of the pie reverse of Robinhood but it seems now they ’ re taking half the interest i.e . whatever interest is reported on Fintel and other sites the shares on loan are half that . Schwab seems to be the same as Etrade again giving half the reported interested for shares on loan . I wouldn ’ t expect 100 % of the reported interest as they ’ re managing most of the work and risk but it seems brokerages are keeping the details on interest paid out from share lending intentionally vague so they can do whatever they want like decide tomorrow they ‘ ll give you table scraps for your shares instead of an actual portion . This is better than share lending that happened behind the scenes in the past with no_income to the actual share owners but the greed here is ridiculous . Anyone tracking brokerages and which ones are better for investors to participate in share lending If they all suck might be worth everyone just shutting off at once on a planned day .

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I have a question and appreciate any insight or guidance. I am able to put away at least 2k/month. Last year, I put it all into a HYSA paying 3.5%. This year though, I am planning to do something different based on 2 ideas. First idea is that it’s way more beneficial to be invested in something of value that appreciates. Second idea is that energy/infrastructure, robotics, and metals are going to be very important and I want to get into those markets. With that in mind, I plan to split the 2000/month 4 ways; 500 into a Roth IRA (holding VT/SCHG/ROBO/XLU), 500 into HYSA, 500 into QQQI/SLVR, 500 into *something else*. It’s the something else that I have a question about. Below are the stocks I’m considering: Energy/Infra: TAN, GRID, IREN Metals: SILJ, REMX, GLTR. ROBOTICS: ARKQ Moonshots: ETHA, BMNR, IBIT, JD, QXO, SLS, POET, CSIQ, AMPX, TE, ARRY, LAC, PATH. I plan to have a combination of shares/leaps from 2-3 of those. Eventually, want to get into covered calls too. Goal is to grow account and eventually start generating passive income. Any critique, information, or advice is welcomed. I have a pension, 457b, and 30k in crypto. I’m 34 and expecting a child next year.",

      "selftext": "The end of 2025 marks my 5 year anniversary as a (fledgling) Value Investor. It has been a very interesting ride to say the least, and I feel I've learned a lot over that time. Naturally, there is still a lot more for me to learn. Of course, one of the most common questions that gets asked of value investing is can we beat the market in the long-term. It is a question I'm sure we all ask ourselves. I know 5 years is not \"long-term\", however, it's a good checkpoint along the path. So, here are my results against the S&P 500 benchmark (w/dividends included for both) and brief thoughts on what I learned: |Year / Portfolio|My Portfolio|S&P 500^(1)| |:-|:--:|:--:| |2021|15.95%|28.26%| |2022|\\-29.46%|\\-14.99%| |2023|42.86%|21.69%| |2024|43.99%|30.03%| |2025|25.05%|15.45%| |**CAGR**|**16.04%**|**14.78%**| ^(1 - S&P 500 data taken from DQYDJ and Of Dollars & Data.) 2021: 11 positions EOY. This was really me figuring out the basics by jumping in feet first. Mistakes were made... Most, if not All, of them. My biggest takeaway in the first year was that most articles on stocks are filled with a lot of noise/static/garbage, and should not be heavily weighted as \"research\". 2022: Moved out of 4 of positions from end of previous year. Acquired three new positions (one spin-off). New META position closed $120 with my cost basis was ~$197. The other hurt was MHH; I believed in my thesis enough to ride out the drop. Lesson 1 was letting go of the garbage, but I should have applied to MHH also. Lesson 2 was stomaching the ride down w/META, which I should not have applied to MHH. 2023: This year was mainly building on what I already owned. I sold out a very small position in IDN, started in 2021. Bought with no real due diligence, then kept swallowing sunshine management shoveled. Sold at a 73% loss. Started with 10 positions. Ended with 10 positions. I don't know that there was huge lesson to '23. I knew by the end of 2022 that IDN was a loss, but held a few months longer as a reminder. 2024: I had a bit more movement this year. I sold 3 positions and had one position get bought out (MDC). Realized I didn't know enough to hold WAL or MU, which fell outside my circle of competence. Hindsight being 20/20, I do wish I would have felt inclined to learn more about MU... Started three new positions. The lesson learned was it is okay to sell weak conviction positions to buy other stronger conviction positions. 9 positions. 2025: I finally closed out MHH early in the year and one other position. With MHH, I realized there was an emotional attachment, that management was not turning it around, and accepted my thesis was wrong. Took the ~40% loss. I also tested out selling covered calls. Did this with WBD, which I acquired in 2022 and built up in subsequent years. Lesson 1 was I'm still human and at times irrational. I need to be more critical in my analysis of where I might be behaving irrationally, such as with MHH. Lesson 2 is that I do not understand options well at all, and I am really not temperamentally suited for them with my current lack of understanding. Lesson 3 was/is a reminder to be patient. I did not find anything in 2025 that I felt I could understand and that was undervalued. And that is okay! I don't need to swing at any pitches to do well.

      "selftext_processed": "The end of 2025 marks my 5 year anniversary as a fledgling Value Investor . It has been a very interesting ride to say the least and I feel Ive learned a lot over that time . Naturally there is still a lot more for me to learn . Of course one of the most common questions that gets asked of value investing is can we beat the market in the longterm . It is a question Im sure we all ask ourselves . I know 5 years is not_longterm however its a good checkpoint along the path . So here are my results against the SP 500 benchmark wdividends included for both and brief thoughts on what I learned Year PortfolioMy PortfolioSP 5001 202115.95 % 28.26 % 202229.46 % 14.99 % 202342.86 % 21.69 % 202443.99 % 30.03 % 202525.05 % 15.45 % CAGR16.04 % 14.78 % 1 SP 500 data taken from DQYDJ and Of Dollars Data . 2021 11 positions EOY . This was really me figuring out the basics by jumping in feet first . Mistakes were made ... Most if not_All of them . My biggest takeaway in the first year was that most articles on stocks are filled with a lot of noisestaticgarbage and should not_be heavily weighted as research . 2022 Moved out of 4 of positions from end of previous year . Acquired three new positions one spinoff . New META position closed $ 120 with my cost basis was $ 197 . The other hurt was MHH I believed in my thesis enough to ride out the drop . Lesson 1 was letting go of the garbage but I should have applied to MHH also . Lesson 2 was stomaching the ride down wMETA which I should not_have applied to MHH . 2023 This year was mainly building on what I already owned . I sold out a very small position in IDN started in 2021 . Bought with no_real due diligence then kept swallowing sunshine management shoveled . Sold at a 73 % loss . Started with 10 positions . Ended with 10 positions . I dont know that there was huge lesson to 23 . I knew by the end of 2022 that IDN was a loss but held a few months longer as a reminder . 2024 I had a bit more movement this year . I sold 3 positions and had one position get bought out MDC . Realized I didnt know enough to hold WAL or MU which fell outside my circle of competence . Hindsight being 2020 I do wish I would have felt inclined to learn more about MU ... Started three new positions . The lesson learned was it is okay to sell weak conviction positions to buy other stronger conviction positions . 9 positions . 2025 I finally closed out MHH early in the year and one other position . With MHH I realized there was an emotional attachment that management was not_turning it around and accepted my thesis was wrong . Took the 40 % loss . I also tested out selling covered calls . Did this with WBD which I acquired in 2022 and built up in subsequent years . Lesson 1 was Im still human and at times irrational . I need to be more critical in my analysis of where I might be behaving irrationally such as with MHH . Lesson 2 is that I do not_understand options well at all and I am really not_temperamentally suited for them with my current lack of understanding . Lesson 3 wasis a reminder to be patient . I did not_find anything in 2025 that I felt I could understand and that was undervalued . And that is okay I dont need to swing at any pitches to do well . cross post full text from Value Investing sub"

      "selftext": "I previously posted that my portfolio going into 2026 is comprised of NVDA, MU, META, GOOGL, MSFT and LLY. This week, I’m taking a deeper dive into META. [META Valuation Analysis]( Trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue through 9/30/25 was $189 billion with a 43% operating margin. The Wall Street consensus is for revenue to increase 21% in 2025 to $199 billion and 18% in 2026 to $235 billion. 99% of revenue and 122% of operating income comes from the Family of Apps division. This is comprised of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. The Reality Labs division generated $2 billion of TTM revenue with an operating loss of $18 billion. **Value Score** META generates 61 Value Points from 43% TTM operating margin plus 18% projected revenue growth. Dividing this by the operating multiple of 17 provides a **Value Score of 3.5**. This puts META firmly in Buy territory. There was a lot of concern at the last earnings call when META mentioned they were going to invest heavily in AI. Given that statement, I wanted to look at the free cash flow of the company. TTM capital expenditures were $63 billion, 68% higher than $37 billion for 2024. The company’s cap ex guidance for 2025 was $70-72 billion. For 2026, I assumed the cap ex would grow slightly from the 2025 guidance. This created a multiple of 42 for the enterprise value divided by the projected unlevered free cash flow. The **adjusted Value Score of 1.5** is firmly in Hold territory. **Segment Valuation** Another technique for valuing the company was to apply revenue multiples to each division and see if the projected equity value is greater than or less than the current market value. The median trailing revenue multiple for companies with a market value greater than $100 billion is 3.36, while the median Value Points is 25.84. This implies that each 7.7 Value Points is worth a 1x multiple. For simplicity and to be generous, **I assumed a 1x multiple for each 7 Value Points of the division**. I applied an 11x multiple to the Family of Apps’ $187 billion of revenue. I was very generous in applying a 3x multiple to Reality Labs’ $2 billion of revenue, which is really a startup valuation metric rather than a public company metric. The formula suggests that **META has 27% potential upside in its stock price**. As always, please do your own research before making any investment decision.",

      "selftext_processed": "I previously posted that my portfolio going into 2026 is comprised of NVDA MU META GOOGL MSFT and LLY . This week I ’ m taking a deeper dive into META . META Valuation Analysis Trailing twelvemonth TTM revenue through 93025 was $ 189 billion with a 43 % operating margin . The Wall Street consensus is for revenue to increase 21 % in 2025 to $ 199 billion and 18 % in 2026 to $ 235 billion . 99 % of revenue and 122 % of operating income comes from the Family of Apps division . This is comprised of Facebook Instagram WhatsApp etc . The Reality Labs division generated $ 2 billion of TTM revenue with an operating loss of $ 18 billion . Value Score META generates 61 Value Points from 43 % TTM operating margin plus 18 % projected revenue growth . Dividing this by the operating multiple of 17 provides a Value Score of 3.5 . This puts META firmly in Buy territory . There was a lot of concern at the last earnings call when META mentioned they were going to invest heavily in AI . Given that statement I wanted to look at the free cash flow of the company . TTM capital expenditures were $ 63 billion 68 % higher than $ 37 billion for 2024 . The company ’ s cap ex guidance for 2025 was $ 7072 billion . For 2026 I assumed the cap ex would grow slightly from the 2025 guidance . This created a multiple of 42 for the enterprise value divided by the projected unlevered free cash flow . The adjusted Value Score of 1.5 is firmly in Hold territory . Segment Valuation Another technique for valuing the company was to apply revenue multiples to each division and see if the projected equity value is greater than or less than the current market value . The median trailing revenue multiple for companies with a market value greater than $ 100 billion is 3.36 while the median Value Points is 25.84 . This implies that each 7.7 Value Points is worth a 1x multiple . For simplicity and to be generous I assumed a 1x multiple for each 7 Value Points of the division . I applied an 11x multiple to the Family of Apps ’ $ 187 billion of revenue . I was very generous in applying a 3x multiple to Reality Labs ’ $ 2 billion of revenue which is really a startup valuation metric rather than a public company metric . The formula suggests that META has 27 % potential upside in its stock price . As always please do your own research before making any investment decision ."

      "selftext": "Recently started a new position with the local government, and hoping for some advice. I have a \"Retirement Plan\" account with my previous employer, and have both pre-tax and after tax funds mixed in. I also have an ESOP, it is a privately traded company, and no dividends. Currently my plan is to roll over the pre-tax portion of the \"Retirement Plan\" and ESOP accounts into a Rollover IRA, and then the after tax portion into my Roth IRA. My question is, is it worth looking more into rolling these two accounts over into my 457b? (The 457b is brand new, has a limited selection of only 25 stocks/bonds/TDFs, and currently defaulted to a 2060 TDF.) Also, I am over the income limit to contribute to a TIRA. I currently dont plan to retire early, and in the set it and forget it mindset. I dont know if any other information would be helpful or not, but if any is needed I can add it. Ultimately, is it worth it to roll over these account into a 457b or keep them in a TIRA?",

I have a Retirement Plan account with my previous employer and have both pretax and after tax funds mixed in . I also have an ESOP it is a privately traded company and no_dividends . Currently my plan is to roll over the pretax portion of the Retirement Plan and ESOP accounts into a Rollover IRA and then the after tax portion into my Roth IRA . My question is is it worth looking more into rolling these two accounts over into my 457b The 457b is brand new has a limited selection of only 25 stocksbondsTDFs and currently defaulted to a 2060 TDF . Also I am over the income limit to contribute to a TIRA . I currently dont plan to retire early and in the set it and forget it mindset . I dont know if any other information would be helpful or not_but if any is needed I can add it . Ultimately is it worth it to roll over these account into a 457b or keep them in a TIRA"

      "title": "The Venezuela lesson: invest in energy security NOT cheap supply - The incoming commodity bull run (uranium, rare earths, precious metals).",
      "selftext": "My investment thesis is straightforward: over the next decade, markets will increasingly reward secure, politically aligned supply chains, not simply the lowest-cost producers. Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy, and when that happens, pricing, capital flows, and valuations change structurally. That’s why I’m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Western-aligned supply chains. My core holdings are Energy Fuels (UUUU), Cameco (CCJ), Centrus Energy (LEU), MP Materials (MP), and Lynas (LYSDY). $300k USD invested. I chose these US/US allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities cannot easily replace. Together, they cover uranium mining, nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment, and rare earth production and processing outside of China. China controls the majority of these rare earths and, following Venezeula, supply restrictions are only going to get worse. We’re in the hoarding era…. The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story, but I think that framing misses the larger signal. Whether oil supply increases or not is secondary. The more important takeaway is geopolitical: the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved. That reinforces a world where energy, materials, and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than free-market commodities. Importantly, Venezuela does not pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths. These markets are nothing like oil. Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through long-term contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance. Rare earths require not just mining, but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop. There is no mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market. History supports this view. During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run, prices did not rise because of speculative demand alone. They rose because utilities realized they were under-contracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure long-term supply. Once utilities began competing for material, prices moved violently and quickly, and equities re-rated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated. Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was. I expect a very similar situation to take place between 2026-2028. After Venezuela, the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Sky-rocket. Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday… Those episodes weren’t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises. When utilities and governments fear supply disruption, they don’t negotiate for the best price; they secure supply at almost any price. That historical lesson matters today. Nuclear power is expanding globally, enrichment capacity is constrained, and non-China rare earth supply remains limited. At the same time, geopolitical risk is rising, not falling. If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be risk-off across all assets. But the second-order effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy, subsidies, and long-term contracts favoring Western-aligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials. I’m not positioned for a short-term commodity spike. I’m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost, just as they did in prior cycles. In those environments, uranium and rare earth equities don’t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure. That’s the bet. TLDR: Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets; history shows these markets don’t reprice gradually - they reprice violently when supply security is questioned. Edit: TRUMP on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY. MOTHERFUCKING COMMODITY SEASON BABY!!!",

      "selftext_processed": "My investment thesis is straightforward over the next decade markets will increasingly reward secure politically aligned supply chains not_simply the lowestcost producers . Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy and when that happens pricing capital flows and valuations change structurally . That ’ s why I ’ m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Westernaligned supply chains . My core holdings are Energy Fuels UUUU Cameco CCJ Centrus Energy LEU MP Materials MP and Lynas LYSDY . $ 300k USD invested . I chose these USUS allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities can not easily replace . Together they cover uranium mining nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment and rare earth production and processing outside of China . China controls the majority of these rare earths and following Venezeula supply restrictions are only going to get worse . We ’ re in the hoarding era… . The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story but I think that framing misses the larger signal . Whether oil supply increases or not_is secondary . The more important takeaway is geopolitical the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved . That reinforces a world where energy materials and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than freemarket commodities . Importantly Venezuela does not_pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths . These markets are nothing_like oil . Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through longterm contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance . Rare earths require not_just mining but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop . There is no_mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market . History supports this view . During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run prices did not_rise because of speculative demand alone . They rose because utilities realized they were undercontracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure longterm supply . Once utilities began competing for material prices moved violently and quickly and equities rerated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated . Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was . I expect a very similar situation to take place between 20262028 . After Venezuela the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Skyrocket . Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday… Those episodes weren ’ t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises . When utilities and governments fear supply disruption they don ’ t negotiate for the best price they secure supply at almost any price . That historical lesson matters today . Nuclear power is expanding globally enrichment capacity is constrained and nonChina rare earth supply remains limited . At the same time geopolitical risk is rising not_falling . If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be riskoff across all assets . But the secondorder effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy subsidies and longterm contracts favoring Westernaligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials . I ’ m not_positioned for a shortterm commodity spike . I ’ m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost just as they did in prior cycles . In those environments uranium and rare earth equities don ’ t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure . That ’ s the bet . TLDR Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets history shows these markets don ’ t reprice gradually they reprice violently when supply security is questioned .

      "selftext": "Edited / reaubmitted to show 20k position. I reported a while back that Deutz is the play. Here is my updated analysis for you to lose granny's inheritance on. **DEUTZ** is the boring German grandpa engine stock that woke up one morning and realised it now owns batteries, drone drives and backup power, but the market still values it like it only sells tractor parts🚜. This grandpa is quietly wiring itself into everything from electrified construction kit to military drone drives and decentralized generators, which means it gets paid whether the world is building roads or preparing for the next crisis. At the same time the German government is funnelling fresh NATO linked defence 🛰️ commitments into broader infrastructure and energy security projects🏗️ so a supplier of engines, gensets and electric drives🪫🔋 sits right in that money river. You are basically buying a slow talking Cologne uncle who just happens to own pick and shovel positions in defense, infrastructure and electrification while everyone else is still staring at shiny pure play defense charts. When the market finally realises this grandpa is not dying but compounding cash flows from multiple policy tailwinds the rerate writes itself.",

DEUTZ is the boring German grandpa engine stock that woke up one morning and realised it now owns batteries drone drives and backup power but the market still values it like it only sells tractor parts🚜 . This grandpa is quietly wiring itself into everything from electrified construction kit to military drone drives and decentralized generators which means it gets paid whether the world is building roads or preparing for the next crisis . At the same time the German government is funnelling fresh NATO linked defence 🛰️ commitments into broader infrastructure and energy security projects🏗️ so a supplier of engines gensets and electric drives🪫🔋 sits right in that money river . You are basically buying a slow talking Cologne uncle who just happens to own pick and shovel positions in defense infrastructure and electrification while everyone else is still staring at shiny pure play defense charts . When the market finally realises this grandpa is not_dying but compounding cash flows from multiple policy tailwinds the rerate writes itself ."

      "title": "BYD +5% after becoming world’s top EV seller with 2.26M units as Tesla deliveries fall 8.6% in 2025",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >In 2011, Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD as a competitor. But some 14 years later, BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game. >The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs, according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week. >BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs, up nearly 28% from 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales: Deliveries fell 8.6% to only 1.6 million, recording the biggest annual drop in the company’s history. >BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not available for purchase in America, while China is Tesla’s second-largest market. >In the fourth quarter, Tesla’s sales came in at about 418,000, down 15.6% from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter, when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $7,500 tax credit expired on October 1. >Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not report its sales by market, providing only global figures, but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue, according to company reports. Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025. >Tesla’s deliveries had grown nearly 50% a year at one point. But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024, posting a modest 1% decline. Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers, such a BYD and legacy global automakers, as well as backlash against Musk’s political activities, which angered many potential American and European buyers. >Early in the year, when Musk was leading the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States, and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites. >The rush to take advantage of the soon-to-expire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter. But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year. >To try to counter the loss of the tax credit, Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, but those versions, while costing about $5,000 less than their “premium” equivalents, also won’t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features. >Aggressive competition >BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market. The intense \\_\\_ in China has prompted the Shenzhen-based company to expand further overseas, though its low-price strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets. >Growth in BYD’s overall sales, including EVs and hybrids, slowed to its weakest pace in five years, with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company’s struggles in China, the world’s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars. >BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025. >While China’s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years, competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers, according to HSBC’s research. Rivals like Geely, China’s second-largest EV maker, fast-rising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi, which debuted its first EV only in 2024, have gradually eroded BYD’s domestic market share. >From a peak of 35% in 2023, BYD’s market share fell to 29% in the first 11 months of 2025, according to China Passenger Car Association. In the same period last year, its sales declined more than 5%, while Geely’s surged nearly 90%. >Wang Chuanfu, BYD’s founder and CEO, attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD’s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting, according to state-run media. But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies. >Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose 1.2% in early trading Friday. Shares closed 2025 up 18.6% for the year, as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk’s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “army” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon. But so far the rollout of Tesla’s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises, limited to two metropolitan areas, Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year’s end",

      "selftext_processed": "Source In 2011 Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD as a competitor . But some 14 years later BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game . The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world ’ s largest seller of EVs according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week . BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs up nearly 28 % from 2024 . Meanwhile Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales Deliveries fell 8.6 % to only 1.6 million recording the biggest annual drop in the company ’ s history . BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not_available for purchase in America while China is Tesla ’ s secondlargest market . In the fourth quarter Tesla ’ s sales came in at about 418000 down 15.6 % from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $ 7500 tax credit expired on October 1 . Unlike other automakers Tesla does not_report its sales by market providing only global figures but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue according to company reports . Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025 . Tesla ’ s deliveries had grown nearly 50 % a year at one point . But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024 posting a modest 1 % decline . Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers such a BYD and legacy global automakers as well as backlash against Musk ’ s political activities which angered many potential American and European buyers . Early in the year when Musk was leading the Trump administration ’ s Department of Government Efficiency there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites . The rush to take advantage of the soontoexpire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter . But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year . To try to counter the loss of the tax credit Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars but those versions while costing about $ 5000 less than their “ premium ” equivalents also won ’ t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features . Aggressive competition BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market . The intense __ in China has prompted the Shenzhenbased company to expand further overseas though its lowprice strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets . Growth in BYD ’ s overall sales including EVs and hybrids slowed to its weakest pace in five years with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company ’ s struggles in China the world ’ s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars . BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025 . While China ’ s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers according to HSBC ’ s research . Rivals like Geely China ’ s secondlargest EV maker fastrising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi which debuted its first EV only in 2024 have gradually eroded BYD ’ s domestic market share . From a peak of 35 % in 2023 BYD ’ s market share fell to 29 % in the first 11 months of 2025 according to China Passenger Car Association . In the same period last year its sales declined more than 5 % while Geely ’ s surged nearly 90 % . Wang Chuanfu BYD ’ s founder and CEO attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD ’ s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting according to staterun media . But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies . Shares of Tesla TSLA rose 1.2 % in early trading Friday . Shares closed 2025 up 18.6 % for the year as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk ’ s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “ army ” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon . But so far the rollout of Tesla ’ s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises limited to two metropolitan areas Austin Texas and San Francisco rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year ’ s end"

      "selftext": "TSLA is up over 2% in premarket trading, even though its Q4 delivery and production numbers came in below expectations. Here are the key figures from the release: Q4 deliveries: 418,227 vehicles (vs. estimates around 440,907) Q4 production: 434,358 vehicles (vs. projected \\~470,780) Full-year 2025 deliveries: 1,636,129 vehicles On the surface, this looks like a miss across both deliveries and production, which would normally pressure the stock. Yet the market reaction is clearly positive heading into the open. A few possible reasons for the move: Expectations may have already been lowered going into the print Investors could be focusing more on margin stabilization, AI/robotics, autonomy, or longer-term narratives rather than near-term unit counts Positioning and short-term flows dominating the open rather than fundamentals This sets up an interesting question for today’s session: Is this strength sustainable, or is it just a knee‑jerk premarket reaction before the market digests the numbers more fully? Curious how others are reading this, bullish resilience, or a setup for volatility once regular trading kicks in?",

Here are the key figures from the release Q4 deliveries 418227 vehicles vs. estimates around 440907 Q4 production 434358 vehicles vs. projected 470780 Fullyear 2025 deliveries 1636129 vehicles On the surface this looks like a miss across both deliveries and production which would normally pressure the stock . Yet the market reaction is clearly positive heading into the open . A few possible reasons for the move Expectations may have already been lowered going into the print Investors could be focusing more on margin stabilization AIrobotics autonomy or longerterm narratives rather than nearterm unit counts Positioning and shortterm flows dominating the open rather than fundamentals This sets up an interesting question for today ’ s session Is this strength sustainable or is it just a knee‑jerk premarket reaction before the market digests the numbers more fully Curious how others are reading this bullish resilience or a setup for volatility once regular trading kicks in"

There are thousands of people taking payouts, but that have spent minimum 4x the amount to get paid once for that dopamine hit. Just to share some analytics without giving too much away, my firm has paid out over 50m+ in the last year, and they profit at around 55-60% margins. And this only grows as they change their plans. Please understand that if you are trying to get rich quick all you do is make them richer. They are designed to seem helpful, but in reality if they were they'd give 1:1 drawdown. They tighten the rules. make things harder for an already difficult market. Please do not blow all your money on these firms. If you have an edge, compound it. Stop going for those big accounts and trying to get paid at minimum pay days.",

Looking to choose some new additions in 2026 and curious aside from keeping in growth mode or shifting to dividends slowly but surely. The breakdown I chalked up from various taxable / tax advantaged accounts, I have the following to mull over... * Taxable vs retirement: * 39% taxable * 61% retirement * Across all those, ratio of holding types: * 95% equities * 5% cash / treasuries Separate from that is emergency fund and primary residence. Let the critiquing / discussion begin (if this is not boring or out of suitable questions). Thx in advance!",

      "selftext_processed": "Howdy all To begin the year doing a review of the familys investment profile and looking for pointers . 48M and 43F both actively working and trying to do our best to invest for long term prosperity mostly focused on growth via ETFs mutual funds with small dashes of some dividend yielding stocks reits . Looking to choose some new additions in 2026 and curious aside from keeping in growth mode or shifting to dividends slowly but surely . The breakdown I chalked up from various taxable tax advantaged accounts I have the following to mull over ... Taxable vs retirement 39 % taxable 61 % retirement Across all those ratio of holding types 95 % equities 5 % cash treasuries Separate from that is emergency fund and primary residence . Let the critiquing discussion begin if this is not_boring or out of suitable questions . Thx in advance"

      "selftext": "Noted that this is anectdotal, but I was reading this article about California new rules for refunds. Somewhat interesting. [ Fast forward to tonight and we place an order at 6 p.m. mind you. At 7 p.m., we receive a text from Doordash saying it is late, and it will be 7:25 instead of 7:05. At 7:28, I click on the link and it says that it is scheduled for 7:15 still? So, I call the Dasher, they tell me that their tablet broke, no one picked up my order and that they already told Doordash that another Dasher was needed. I text Doordash - no response ever. Then I call Doordash. I get to a rep who says I can file a request for refund. I should note that the restaurant closes at 8 and my food doesn't get picked up. The rep can't help so I tell the rep that I want to speak to a supervisor. The rep says there are a bunch of supervisors, I'm 34th in line so I will get a call back. I ask when. They said it could be 2 hours. A company worth $100B market cap that has invested $billions in technology that cannot: manage a simple driver change, manage to get a driver to a restuarant with 2 hours notice, cannot manage to have a supervisor respond to an issue within 2 hours... This is systematic. Nothing works across their enterprise after billions spent. Of course, this is just my issue, but I've seen this before. This would never have happened with Amazon or any other tech company worth anything. I know this is a vent, but it really makes you wonder why California created their new law, how others will follow, and if Dash has any management capability to improve. I ended up speaking to the restaurant right before they closed. \"This happens all the time with Doordash\" were not the words an investor or customer would want to hear.",

Additonally, i will be committing an additional 1,000 a month into 13-week t-bills set to reinvest automatically. at the moment, i have no expenses and would be well positioned to set aside the money comfortably. is this a good plan? regarding the actual purchase process, i have read it would be ideal to secure a formal appraisal, write a gift of equity letter, and fill out a form 709. i've also heard suggestions for a quitclaim deed. any other tips and explanations would be appreciated, as my understanding of the purchase process is, admittedly, a bit modest.",

Additonally i will be committing an additional 1000 a month into 13week tbills set to reinvest automatically . at the moment i have no_expenses and would be well positioned to set aside the money comfortably . is this a good plan regarding the actual purchase process i have read it would be ideal to secure a formal appraisal write a gift of equity letter and fill out a form 709. ive also heard suggestions for a quitclaim deed . any other tips and explanations would be appreciated as my understanding of the purchase process is admittedly a bit modest ."

While Amazon has killed it with platforms like AWS and its marketplace, it’s never quite had the product first mentality necessary to thrive in the next major tech wave AI. Sure, Alexa and Kindle were cool, but honestly, they’re more the exception than the rule, and neither of them is exactly leading the charge anymore. As we move past the platform era, Amazon’s reliance on third party innovation especially when it comes to AI may hurt its ability to compete in a space where AI driven products are taking over. What do you think? Can Amazon pivot and catch up or is it too late for them to lead in AI?",

While Amazon has killed it with platforms like AWS and its marketplace it ’ s never_quite had the product first mentality necessary to thrive in the next major tech wave AI . Sure Alexa and Kindle were cool but honestly they ’ re more the exception than the rule and neither_of them is exactly leading the charge anymore . As we move past the platform era Amazon ’ s reliance on third party innovation especially when it comes to AI may hurt its ability to compete in a space where AI driven products are taking over . What do you think Can Amazon pivot and catch up or is it too late for them to lead in AI"

      "title": "TSLA Q4 Delivery Misses Expectations, But Energy Storage Shows Strong Growth",
      "selftext": "Tesla just reported Q4 deliveries of 418,227 vehicles, missing the market's expectations of 440,907, a 5.2% drop. Full year deliveries came in at 1.64 million, down 8.6% YoY, with an estimate of 1.6 million. The Q4 miss can be attributed to a few key factors: the expiration of the U.S. EV tax credit, the aging product line (Model 3/Y still lead but are lacking major updates), increased competition in Europe and China, and some brand image issues. However, the energy storage business has been a bright spot, with deployments hitting 14.2 GWh in Q4 (up 29% YoY) and a total of 46.7 GWh for the year. Demand for Megapack and Powerwall remains strong, which is definitely a positive for the energy division. From a technical perspective, the stock is in a bearish environment, with support at 440 and resistance at 460. The bullish signal at 460 from December 30 has pretty much played out, and the stock has recently dipped below the 440 support. If it doesn’t reclaim 440, it’s likely to fall to 432.5 and 420. If the stock reclaims 440 next week, we could see a rebound, testing the 445, 450, and 460 resistance levels. However, unless it breaks 460 and re-enters a bullish environment, any rally could be short-lived. For those looking to go long, it might be better to wait until the stock breaks and holds above 460 before jumping in. Entering in a bearish market might leave you stuck in a losing position.",

Wont this also negatively affect the sale of the RayBan AI glasses since one needs a Meta account to fully use all features If the user accounts are disabled why would one purchase their glasses"

Excuse the language on the broker, I'm just a gambling addict from Turkey. I bought 3 call contracts on Micron that were 7 months out till expiration right before earnings and I happened to be correct about the company's performance. Not exactly an earnings play, I was actually planning to hold these longer, but especially after Micron's huge gains today, I couldn't help but want to secure my profits first before thinking about what to do next. I'm currently thinking maybe I'll buy ATM call options 6 months out on WDC, which is another company in a similar situation as Micron anyways tbh, and then hodl those for the next 3 months and see where this goes.",

All in all, I typically have around 30 unique tickers and about 150 positions open at any given time. Those positions can be relatively small, up to hundreds of contracts. Yes, lots of people had better returns in 2025. I’m trying to thread the needle of aggressive returns with sizable hedges. With the market going up for 8 months straight, my hedges hurt quite a bit. But should a black swan event have occurred, or the market switched to bear mode, I would have done pretty well (especially compared to the market). Here’s to 2026 being a good one as well!",

      "selftext": "One day I decided I needed a market edge and so I took a few 50mg Vyvanse broke them off and snorted them to get a faster kick. I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing happened... The problem? Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it won't speed up its effects. You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached L-lysine (amino acid) that breaks off in your body using enzymes... thus creating this slow-release mechanism. I wasn't discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin, crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me \"the edge\". [The delivery process]( I instantly got hit with \"Writers euphoria\", some people say they see colors, all I saw was a pump'n'dump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump. Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open. **If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about SLS.** I will attack this pump'n'dump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this **'short'** trip. # Buckle up buckeroos, we're gonna start with fundamentals Currently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt. cap close to USD 600M. First thing that I ask is who is the customer? It's a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 1-2 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer: Acute Myleoid Leukemia. If we look at how many people get it globally we're gonna arrive at roughly: 1.5-2.0 persons / 100.000 Now let's look at all cancers (this will be important): ± 200 people / 100.000 **.... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN.** ( What I didn't realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream, I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being.) \\----- Why am I mentioning all cancers? Well it's to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pump'n'dump posts: That this is a replacement for **Keytruda** (which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80% gross margins). But here's the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts: Keytruda is all-purpose, while the shit that SLS is producing **is NOT**. You need to be tested for the presence of WT-1 antigen which is only done for blood disorders/cancers. You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing about it being usable for this (source: I know a few doctors). This means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100... SLS drugs will barely target 1% of that. Why do I say barely? Well because that these drugs are given to specific people... CDK-9 is effective only for people with a certain (less common) mutation and GPS is given (to my understanding) to people in remission. So let's do simple math (before I make you even more depressed): USD 25B ---> 1% ---> 250M (let's be optimistic and say that 80% are eligible) --> 200M But wait it gets better... however right now my heart is pumping, pupils are needle-point sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk... **low doses of ketamine.** [Unlocking my full potential]( Keytruda gets administered constantly, unlike GPS which is like <20 injections. So that 200M you were looking at? Yea it's probably way lower. Now that we've got over the \"HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS\" let's focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEO's marketing/dilution pattern. # A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter. If you've ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE. 1. The technical guy who actually knows shit 2. The bullshitter who's liked, but does shit and yaps whole day The first one if he's career driven will become a good CTO. The second one will become CEO. This is true for every profession, reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell, especially bullshit, to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity. It's all a zero-sum game. Nobody wins, especially not the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like white-monkeys are in China. The CEO SLS is no different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter. How do you become a master bullshitter? Ambiguity. Think of the (1) technical guy, he will always be precise in his formulations, because he knows what he's talking about. the (2) bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart. The CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news, carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members (read bagholders and MLM leaders) parrot the \"actual\" but not-factual message to the masses. Just look up the recent posts on bagholder/p'n'd subreddits for SLS. It's all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team. After the share price jumps high, the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion, not including the perpetual warrant inducement plan (which alone makes acquisition very unlikely). The best part? The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50% shareholders want to lower his above-standard pay. And there's a good reason he's getting such high cash bonuses - he knows it's all bullshit. All of this will mean that if this company gets acquired (which is unlikely) it will be sold at a discount and not a premium. Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $4 a share... with constantly increasing share count it's amplifying the speed at which the company's valuation grows even though they still haven't really presented anything substantial. # Let's Look at the Recent Catalyst So what spiked the current share price above $4? Results of the REGAL study were postponed, which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of: \"We're still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study.\" Which is absolutely hilarious. Because it doesn't say anything about SLS specifically, yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one (it may be, but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant) The study includes both BAT (best available treatment) and the SLS drugs. The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones, while the SLS patients have already died (grim I know). Their argument: Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever they're saying. So why do people think it's \"good news\" for SLS? Because people think they understand statistics when they actually don't. Heck I studied it, specialized in it as a mathematician... and even I will never dare to say that I fully understand statistics. Reality is that the delay might be negative, neutral or positive. **WHY?:** * Many factors come into patient selection - The study isn't the typical \"let's pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests\" they come in different cohorts/groups * You have high odds of selecting the \"good group\" that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment (this can be 10-15%) * All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should (which is a very misleading statistic, and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people)... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years -> and that will average out, so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not enough to know if there is a statistical significance. Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit, because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer, but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis. * A small sample size like this is prone to distortions, follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not, which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn. **But most importantly:** * BAT for AML has significantly improved... and by significantly I mean really significantly. The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 10-12 months. Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS. # Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come The cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production. Given their current free cash, it's more than likely that they will need to raise more money. # So Why Are You Bearish? Well I like to think of it in terms of probability / uncertainty, specifically conditional probability. (Let's denote P(event | A ) as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening) Asks yourself this, which probability is higher?: (1) P( Good News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad ) (2) P( Bad News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad ) Which is more likely to be true? (1) > (2) or (1) < (2)? I'm gonna go with the likelihood of bad news as probable... This doesn't mean that the drug won't work, I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections won't be as high as the current valuation. The fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs, is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their life-saving medication out there... This isn't the \"age of biotech\" (un)fortunately. Hence I'm buying puts. **NOTE:** I'm not a biochemist, I might be wrong and I'm betting only money that I'm willing to lose, so don't follow blindly, do your own DD. Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots. One last thing... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement. **My position is small, because I'm locked down in other trades, sharing mostly because I like to do equity research:** EDIT: To the existing and new bots out there, the SLS cult and other believers, yes I will double down if the stock price goes up:) Answering here since I received \"very nice\" DM requests.",

      "selftext_processed": "One day I decided I needed a market edge and so I took a few 50mg Vyvanse broke them off and snorted them to get a faster kick . I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing_happened ... The problem Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it wont speed up its effects . You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached Llysine amino acid that breaks off in your body using enzymes ... thus creating this slowrelease mechanism . I wasnt discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me the edge . The delivery process I instantly got hit with Writers euphoria some people say they see colors all I saw was a pumpndump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump . Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open . If you havent figured it out yet Im talking about SLS . I will attack this pumpndump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this short trip . Buckle up buckeroos were gon na start with fundamentals Currently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt . cap close to USD 600M . First thing that I ask is who is the customer Its a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 12 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer Acute Myleoid Leukemia . If we look at how many people get it globally were gon na arrive at roughly 1.52.0 persons 100.000 Now lets look at all cancers this will be important ± 200 people 100.000 .... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN . What I didnt realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being . Why am I mentioning all cancers Well its to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pumpndump posts That this is a replacement for Keytruda which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80 % gross margins . But heres the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts Keytruda is allpurpose while the shit that SLS is producing is NOT_You need to be tested for the presence of WT1 antigen which is only done for blood disorderscancers . You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing_about it being usable for this source I know a few doctors . This means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100 ... SLS drugs will barely target 1 % of that . Why do I say barely Well because that these drugs are given to specific people ... CDK9 is effective only for people with a certain less common mutation and GPS is given to my understanding to people in remission . So lets do simple math before I make you even more depressed USD 25B 1 % 250M lets be optimistic and say that 80 % are eligible 200M But wait it gets better ... however right now my heart is pumping pupils are needlepoint sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk ... low doses of ketamine . Unlocking my full potential Keytruda gets administered constantly unlike GPS which is like 20 injections . So that 200M you were looking at Yea its probably way lower . Now that weve got over the HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS lets focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEOs marketingdilution pattern . A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter . If youve ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE . 1 . The technical guy who actually knows shit 2 . The bullshitter whos liked but does shit and yaps whole day The first one if hes career driven will become a good CTO . The second one will become CEO . This is true for every profession reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell especially bullshit to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity . Its all a zerosum game . Nobody_wins especially not_the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like whitemonkeys are in China . The CEO SLS is no_different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter . How do you become a master bullshitter Ambiguity . Think of the 1 technical guy he will always be precise in his formulations because he knows what hes talking about . the 2 bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart . The CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members read bagholders and MLM leaders parrot the actual but notfactual_message to the masses . Just look up the recent posts on bagholderpnd subreddits for SLS . Its all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team . After the share price jumps high the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion not_including the perpetual warrant inducement plan which alone makes acquisition very unlikely . The best part The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50 % shareholders want to lower his abovestandard pay . And theres a good reason hes getting such high cash bonuses he knows its all bullshit . All of this will mean that if this company gets acquired which is unlikely it will be sold at a discount and not_a premium . Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $ 4 a share ... with constantly increasing share count its amplifying the speed at which the companys valuation grows even though they still havent really presented anything substantial . Lets Look at the Recent Catalyst So what spiked the current share price above $ 4 Results of the REGAL study were postponed which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of Were still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study . Which is absolutely hilarious . Because it doesnt say anything about SLS specifically yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one it may be but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant The study includes both BAT best available treatment and the SLS drugs . The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones while the SLS patients have already died grim I know . Their argument Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever theyre saying . So why do people think its good news for SLS Because people think they understand statistics when they actually dont . Heck I studied it specialized in it as a mathematician ... and even I will never_dare to say that I fully understand statistics . Reality is that the delay might be negative neutral or positive . WHY Many factors come into patient selection The study isnt the typical lets pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests they come in different cohortsgroups You have high odds of selecting the good group that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment this can be 1015 % All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should which is a very misleading statistic and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people ... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years and that will average out so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not_enough to know if there is a statistical significance . Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis . A small sample size like this is prone to distortions follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not_which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn . But most importantly BAT for AML has significantly improved ... and by significantly I mean really significantly . The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 1012 months . Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS . Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come The cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production . Given their current free cash its more than likely that they will need to raise more money . So Why Are You Bearish Well I like to think of it in terms of probability uncertainty specifically conditional probability . Lets denote Pevent A as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening Asks yourself this which probability is higher 1 P Good News CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad 2 P Bad News CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad Which is more likely to be true 1 2 or 1 2 Im gon na go with the likelihood of bad news as probable ... This doesnt mean that the drug wont work I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no_matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections wont be as high as the current valuation . The fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their lifesaving medication out there ... This isnt the age of biotech unfortunately . Hence Im buying puts . NOTE Im not_a biochemist I might be wrong and Im betting only money that Im willing to lose so dont follow blindly do your own DD . Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots . One last thing ... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement . My position is small because Im locked down in other trades sharing mostly because I like to do equity research EDIT To the existing and new bots out there the SLS cult and other believers yes I will double down if the stock price goes up Answering here since I received very nice DM requests ."
