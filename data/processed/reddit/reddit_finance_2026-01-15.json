      "selftext": "U.S. stock futures moved lower as traders reacted to Wall Street’s first consecutive losses in 2026. Futures tied to the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all slipped, signaling a cautious open after recent selling pressure ended the market’s early-year momentum. The pullback reflects a mix of profit taking, sector rotation, and uncertainty around macro conditions, with tech stocks facing the most pressure in recent sessions. After a strong start to the year, some traders appear to be reassessing risk and waiting for clearer signals from earnings and economic data. For now, the softer futures suggest markets may stay range bound in the short term, as investors balance longer term optimism with near term caution. Whether this turns into a deeper correction or just a pause will likely depend on upcoming data and broader market sentiment.",

Tech and AI are obvious contenders, but it’s hard to know which names will truly dominate. Green energy and sustainability seem promising with policy shifts, and healthcare and biotech could benefit from aging populations and innovation. At the same time, solid, stable companies could provide balance in a volatile market. What’s everyone watching, any under-the-radar picks, or sectors you’d avoid?

Commoditys is where smart people have had a safe haven against the rigged ass market for quite some time . After all no_ones big enough to influence the price of something so common as silver worldwide becouse someone with silver will just cash out . But thats where they went wrong Theres so much wealth at the top we are nearing an era where even the price of something so common as a chicken egg can be manipulated to 100x its current price and substained for a long time . Sure a chicken farmer is in heaven in this scenario . But the top bought out all of the farms and since 99 % of folk live in cities whos left to keep markets honest Same for silver . By the time someone middle class sets up an egg farming operation in their country vacation property the price has already receded . Do you know anyone irl who is mining silver or hoarding large amounts If the common man has no_silver to cash out then theres nothing_to keep the price honest and guess who owns the mining companies your percieved value of something is meaningless . You could say google is a 100 trillion dollar company and be right if you have all the wealth becouse thats the magic of wash trading . Whos left to sell shares of google Real shares not_borrowed ones . meanwhile the influence drips up too . Not_just money . If google is worth 5 trillion only a few people know why and at any moment could reverse the scheme and wipe out half its value . Thats some serious leverage over the executive suite off the books . but be thankful . Becouse some day maybe years from now the masses will finally catch on . And when they do the market will crash . Your retirement account only rises now becouse people buy puts and short stocks . But some day when all the bears are gone theyll come feasting for the buy and hold crew . for now your longs help fund wash up . And so you feel like a smart person becouse all you did was set money aside with no_effort . Some day that free lunch will stop being free ."

      "selftext": "Hi all. I’ve had Ruberik on my watch last for the last several months and just today, I finally dipped my toes in to start a position. I am by no means competent in the space (data security/ cloud data management), but am enticed by their growth and great margins. I am providing a link in the comments to their Q3 earnings report and 2 prior RBRK threads from this sub in the past. *Key Q3 earnings takeaways-* Subscription ARR grew 34% yoy to $1.35B. 3rd quarter revenue grew 48% yoy to $350M. 2,638 customers with $100k or more in subscription ARR; 27% increase yoy. Upon announcing Q3 earnings the share price spiked 25% to 92.77 and has since slowly gave back all those gains. Share price closed at $68.14 at the end of today’s trading session. I understand they will be trying to claw market share away from several more established players in the space (Okta, Panw, Zscaler, Crowdstrike, etc) … anybody else think they can continue chipping away & gaining market share? Open to any and all discussion; especially from those with knowledge of the industry and/or work in the field and use their products.",

I am by no_means competent in the space data security cloud data management but am enticed by their growth and great margins . I am providing a link in the comments to their Q3 earnings report and 2 prior RBRK threads from this sub in the past . Key Q3 earnings takeaways Subscription ARR grew 34 % yoy to $ 1.35B . 3rd quarter revenue grew 48 % yoy to $ 350M . 2638 customers with $ 100k or more in subscription ARR 27 % increase yoy . Upon announcing Q3 earnings the share price spiked 25 % to 92.77 and has since slowly gave back all those gains . Share price closed at $ 68.14 at the end of today ’ s trading session . I understand they will be trying to claw market share away from several more established players in the space Okta Panw Zscaler Crowdstrike etc … anybody else think they can continue chipping away gaining market share Open to any and all discussion especially from those with knowledge of the industry andor work in the field and use their products ."

It’s a full time job where I get paid 30$ an hour and work 8 hours a day. I have no bills and no debts. I literally can invest or save all my money earned I just don’t know how. The job offers benefits but I’m not too knowledgable on them. I also have a 10K from grad party. What are things I should be taught before I start working even longer from now? 30$ an hour is decent money at 19. For more info I live with a friend who covers everything. That’s why I have no bills or debt. It’s why I even have the job. Now how do I invest to become rich or just well off?",

      "selftext": "Be honest for a second. Do you really think markets today behave like they did 10 or 15 years ago? That prices are just “fair value” reacting cleanly to numbers? Most of us are still analyzing markets as if the rules didn’t change. But they did. Regulation, geopolitics, macro pressure, government intervention, outcomes aren’t just discovered anymore, they’re managed. And expectations are shaped long before results show up. Numbers show what already happened. Language shows what management is preparing you for. Yet earnings calls are still read like isolated documents: this quarter’s numbers, this quarter’s guidance, move on. That’s where most of the signal gets lost. Executives don’t reset every quarter. They adjust the story over time: * initiatives that quietly disappear * “temporary headwinds” that never leave * confident language turning cautious * Q&A answers getting longer but less specific If you only read the latest call, all of that is invisible. Once you start comparing earnings calls across quarters, it’s hard to unsee. Reading them one by one feels like watching shadows and thinking you understand what’s really happening. I might be wrong, but after getting tired of tracking this manually with notes and spreadsheets, I built a small tool to compare earnings calls over time and surface narrative and tone shifts. No predictions, no price targets, just context from public data. Still early, but it completely changed how I read earnings calls. Curious if others here see the same shift, or if the quarter-by-quarter approach still makes sense in today’s market.",

But they did . Regulation geopolitics macro pressure government intervention outcomes aren ’ t just discovered anymore they ’ re managed . And expectations are shaped long before results show up . Numbers show what already happened . Language shows what management is preparing you for . Yet earnings calls are still read like isolated documents this quarter ’ s numbers this quarter ’ s guidance move on . That ’ s where most of the signal gets lost . Executives don ’ t reset every quarter . They adjust the story over time initiatives that quietly disappear “ temporary headwinds ” that never_leave confident language turning cautious QA answers getting longer but less specific If you only read the latest call all of that is invisible . Once you start comparing earnings calls across quarters it ’ s hard to unsee . Reading them one by one feels like watching shadows and thinking you understand what ’ s really happening . I might be wrong but after getting tired of tracking this manually with notes and spreadsheets I built a small tool to compare earnings calls over time and surface narrative and tone shifts . No_predictions no_price targets just context from public data . Still early but it completely changed how I read earnings calls . Curious if others here see the same shift or if the quarterbyquarter approach still makes sense in today ’ s market ."

      "selftext": "I've been studying for a while the market history. The \"time in the market\" saying is true; if you get the US stock market 200-year average, even the 1929 crash feels more like a correction than what it really was. 2020 is just a blip in the bigger scheme of things. But we all aren't likely to even see 2100, so our time in the market isn't that great. Some of those blips are huge things for a single lifetime, hence the question. At what point a correction and a \"fasten your seatbelts\" scenario actually becomes a general disaster that will ruin a lot of people and take years to recover? For example, all the signs in April would point to a major downturn in the following months. Seeing it now, in the end it was just a small bump on the road. Even in the pandemic, everyone was somewhat able to foreshadow the shit hitting the fan (the S&P 500 began to fall down in mid-late february 2020, and we all were seeing huge news everywhere since december 2019). Anyone with a minor glance of the news could see what was likely to come in the following months. Now in 2026, everyone is talking of AI bubble, another global recession in the likes of 2008, an apocalyptical disaster scenario where everything starting falling from the sky. But for someone investing, what would be the line (or zone) between keeping the stocks during a poor month, and outright selling them all to avoid being hit by a crisis? What could be the next triggers for it to happen?",

      "selftext": "Listen up you beautiful financially illiterate degenerates, put down the SPY 0DTE lotto tickets for 30 seconds and use your 2 remaining brain cells. MDA Space (MDA.TO) (MDALF) for OTC is an actual space company, not another fake AI “cloud-enabled synergies” scam. These Canadian nerds have been building space tech since the 60s and now they’re a full-on “international space mission partner” doing satellite systems, space robotics, and geo-intelligence. Translation: they make the robot arms that grab space junk, build the metal sky-wafers that beam your doomscrolling, and sell government-grade spy-pictures so your bagholding gets watched from orbit. They build and operate satellite constellations for communications, Earth and space observation, and exploration infrastructure. Their customers are governments and big-boy contractors, not Dave from Robinhood on margin. THINK GOLDEN DOME They even rebranded from “MDA Ltd.” to “MDA Space” in 2024, which is marketing-speak for “please give us a space stonk multiple.” As of mid-January 2026 the thing trades around the high 20s CAD, after ripping last year into the 40s before the apes collectively discovered zero day options again and forgot Canada exists. You’re telling me clapped-up EV penny stocks can trade at nosebleed valuations, but an actual space hardware and geo-intel shop with real government contracts is stuck on the TSX begging for volume like a low-effort meme post? Pete Hegseth is now literally the guy in charge of handing out the Pentagon’s space money, so the MDA ape thesis basically writes itself. And while you smoothbrains are dumpster-diving weekly options, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is out touring Starbase and yelling at defense contractors to “move quickly, embrace risks, be bold” with new tech and space systems. If the guy running the world’s biggest military budget wants less bloated bureaucracy and more orbital hardware, maybe just maybe an actual Canadian space shop with satellites, robotics, and geo-intel isn’t the dumbest place to park a few loonies PT $200 CAD",

MDA Space MDA.TO MDALF for OTC is an actual space company not_another fake AI “ cloudenabled synergies ” scam . These Canadian nerds have been building space tech since the 60s and now they ’ re a fullon “ international space mission partner ” doing satellite systems space robotics and geointelligence . Translation they make the robot arms that grab space junk build the metal skywafers that beam your doomscrolling and sell governmentgrade spypictures so your bagholding gets watched from orbit . They build and operate satellite constellations for communications Earth and space observation and exploration infrastructure . Their customers are governments and bigboy contractors not_Dave from Robinhood on margin . THINK GOLDEN DOME They even rebranded from “ MDA Ltd. ” to “ MDA Space ” in 2024 which is marketingspeak for “ please give us a space stonk multiple. ” As of midJanuary 2026 the thing trades around the high 20s CAD after ripping last year into the 40s before the apes collectively discovered zero day options again and forgot Canada exists . You ’ re telling me clappedup EV penny stocks can trade at nosebleed valuations but an actual space hardware and geointel shop with real government contracts is stuck on the TSX begging for volume like a loweffort meme post Pete Hegseth is now literally the guy in charge of handing out the Pentagon ’ s space money so the MDA ape thesis basically writes itself . And while you smoothbrains are dumpsterdiving weekly options Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is out touring Starbase and yelling at defense contractors to “ move quickly embrace risks be bold ” with new tech and space systems . If the guy running the world ’ s biggest military budget wants less bloated bureaucracy and more orbital hardware maybe just maybe an actual Canadian space shop with satellites robotics and geointel isn ’ t the dumbest place to park a few loonies PT $ 200 CAD"

They live for these moments and are incredibly bias Do you think China and every else wants to permanently pay 5x for silver for Ai solarchips One real mote I hear is “ silver is having a temporary shortage ” true Anouther real mote is price manipulation but again do you think ChinaUsA and the world want to pay 5x the price when they know it can be suppressedAbsolutely not_This is the Tom Lee Speculation play of Bitcoin will hit 250000 by the start of 2026 because “ all the bitcoin has been bought up and only 3 percent of the supply is left ."

      "selftext": "# MonthPulse Tactical: Neutral/Volatile Setups for Jan 2026 [NA Market] **Date:** January 14, 2026 **Strategy:** Long-Only Tactical Momentum **Focus:** NYSE, NASDAQ, TSX Markets are chopping as geopolitical headlines (Iran) and mixed bank earnings weigh on the indices. However, **chaos creates ladders**. We are seeing a historic decoupling where Commodities (Gold/Silver/Uranium) and Crypto are ripping while Big Tech takes a breather. This is a stock picker's environment. Here are the top high-conviction setups for the next 30 days: | Ticker | Price | Target | Gain % | Risk | Note | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | **COIN** | $255.47 | $350.00 | +37% | High | BTC at $95k is the fuel. | | **CCO.TO** | C$152.17 | C$185.00 | +21% | Med | Nuclear super-cycle breakout. | | **PAAS** | $55.86 | $75.00 | +34% | High | Silver at $92/oz = Money Printer. | | **NVDA** | $182.14 | $250.00 | +37% | Med | Best dip-buy in Tech. | ### 🚨 The Thesis * **COIN (Coinbase):** Bitcoin is proving to be the safe haven of 2026. With BTC holding $95k, COIN's transaction volumes are set to explode. It's high beta, but the trend is undeniable. * **CCO.TO (Cameco):** Energy security is back on the menu. With oil volatile and nuclear adoption growing, Cameco is the premier way to play the uranium squeeze on the TSX. * **PAAS (Pan American Silver):** Silver is absolutely parabolic right now (~$92/oz). Miners lag the spot price, which means PAAS has significant catch-up potential. * **NVDA (Nvidia):** The king is resting. Down from highs, NVDA at $182 offers a tactical entry before the next leg of AI capex announcements. --- *Disclaimer: Not financial advice. I am a portfolio manager, not your fiduciary.

      "selftext": "Background: M28, good income, high risk tolerance. Current portfolio: 50% in stocks, 20% in SPYM, 20% in target date 401k, 10% in cash. I'm relatively new in my investment journey but I have done a fair amount of research. In March 2025, my portfolio was down 30% and it really didn't bother me one bit. The only issue I had was that since I was already 100% invested, I didn't have cash to buy more at the discounted prices :( Next time when something like this happens, I want to be able to make the best use of it. 1. Should I keep some money in gold, silver or bonds? If yes, how much? I don't care about short term fluctuations and want highest expected returns in the long term. 3. I read a research paper suggesting 100% equities for long horizon, but then I will have the same problem as last year. Maybe I can go 100% equities but keep a big chunk of it in a broad index. When the downturn comes, sell some of it to buy high conviction stocks trading at more extreme discounts. 3. I am also thinking of changing my pension funds from target date to fully broad market equity. Thoughts? I'd appreciate any suggestions. It will be really helpful if you could point me to some good resources like research papers, blogposts, etc. Thank you very much!!",

      "selftext": "While I understand that simple small Software in Teams of few people can be replaced by ai written Software, I don‘t get theis Thesis for Big Software Companies that are deeply integrated in the Industry Ecosystem as Single Source of Truth! A Short summary by ai of my thoughts: While AI is changing how we work, established giants like SAP, Salesforce, and DocuSign remain indispensable because they provide the reliability, features and trust that you can not get from self build and self sustained Software. Key Arguments: \\- All These complex System have started as simpler systems, the „unecessary“ are there for a reason Most of a time and as soon as Self Development solutions get more Mature they will get too complex to self sustain. That‘s the Point companies will have to Switch back to the big realiable systems. \\- Mission-Critical Stability: Traditional enterprise systems offer much higher \"up-time\" guarantees than self coded Software that unexperienced vibe coders developed. In business, a 0.1% difference in reliability can mean the difference between a smooth operation and a costly disaster. \\- Built-in Standards: These platforms are already the \"plumbing\" of the business world. They integrate seamlessly into complex industries (like finance and healthcare) where security and regulations are non-negotiable. \\- Also to be able to switch your Job without to have to learn a new tool someone developed with ai it‘s essential that people can start with Software they already know. Having paid Standards that every one knows is a benefit, in contrast to free that everybody has to get familiar with. \\- AI as an Upgrade, Not a Replacement: Instead of being replaced by AI, these companies are absorbing it. By adding AI features (to their already trusted foundations, they offer a safe way for businesses to innovate without risking their core data. Docusign for example is not where it is because it‘s a signature Solution, but it’s a **trustworthy** signature Solution with a „history“. **You might vibe code a similar Solution in a few weeks, but you won‘t build the trust!** The Bottom Line: You can't run a global business on \"smart\" self developed tools alone; you need tools that are proven to do their job, scale and guaranteed not to fail. **Is there something I don‘t see or understand or Why are Software Stocks are getting sold off again?** edit: tried to improve the ai slop (critic was justified)",

Key Arguments All These complex System have started as simpler systems the „ unecessary “ are there for a reason Most of a time and as soon as Self Development solutions get more Mature they will get too complex to self sustain . That ‘ s the Point companies will have to Switch back to the big realiable systems . MissionCritical Stability Traditional enterprise systems offer much higher uptime guarantees than self coded Software that unexperienced vibe coders developed . In business a 0.1 % difference in reliability can mean the difference between a smooth operation and a costly disaster . Builtin Standards These platforms are already the plumbing of the business world . They integrate seamlessly into complex industries like finance and healthcare where security and regulations are nonnegotiable . Also to be able to switch your Job without to have to learn a new tool someone developed with ai it ‘ s essential that people can start with Software they already know . Having paid Standards that every one knows is a benefit in contrast to free that everybody has to get familiar with . AI as an Upgrade Not_a Replacement Instead of being replaced by AI these companies are absorbing it . By adding AI features to their already trusted foundations they offer a safe way for businesses to innovate without risking their core data . Docusign for example is not_where it is because it ‘ s a signature Solution but it ’ s a trustworthy signature Solution with a „ history “ . You might vibe code a similar Solution in a few weeks but you won ‘ t build the trust The Bottom Line You cant run a global business on smart self developed tools alone you need tools that are proven to do their job scale and guaranteed not_to fail . Is there something I don ‘ t see or understand or Why are Software Stocks are getting sold off again edit tried to improve the ai slop critic was justified"

      "selftext": "I’ve been focusing heavily on silver, and these are the metrics I’m watching to understand where this market might be headed. Posting this here to get feedback and checks. 1.The first thing I track is the silver:gold. If silver starts outperforming gold aggressively and the ratio drops rapidly below 50:1, it usually signals speculative momentum. 2.I’m also watching COMEX registered inventories very closely. If registered silver keeps falling, COMEX is more likely to increase margin requirements to reduce delivery risk. That can temporarily cap price. On the flip side, if there’s a sudden large inflow into COMEX vaults, it signals that a large bank or institution is preparing to sell or short silver, or that metal is being moved in to ease delivery pressure. 3.China is another key piece. China controls a large share of silver refining and industrial demand, and whenever Shanghai silver trades at a strong premium to international prices, it points to regional physical tightness. Any changes in Chinese industrial policy or metals regulation tend to show up in silver before the rest of the market reacts. And, with Asian physical premiums elevated, there’s a clear arbitrage incentive: buy paper silver cheaply in Western markets, take delivery, move it to Asia, and sell at a premium. This slowly drains Western vaults and increases structural stress in the futures market. 4.Also A strengthening US Dollar Index combined with signs of geopolitical stability increases the probability of a correction. A weakening dollar and rising uncertainty usually act as fuel. 5.I am also watching silver lease rates. If lease rates spike into the 5–10% range, it usually means there’s an acute physical shortage. Historically, this often leads to a sharp correction. 6.In the futures market, I pay close attention to price vs open interest. If price is rising while open interest is falling, the rally is likely being driven by short covering, not new long positions. If I’m missing any major indicators - fundamental, technical, or structural framework, I’d appreciate hearing them. Trying to understand the plumbing of this market before it breaks. Note: The current price of silver is about 92$ per ounce.",

      "selftext": "**Current Price:** \\~GBX 123 / CAD 2.29 **Market Cap:** \\~£580m / CAD 1.06B Amaroq just transitioned from a developer to a producer, beating its FY2025 production guidance during a commissioning year. You are buying a high-grade gold mine that is ramping up exactly as major banks (JPM, Goldman) forecast gold to hit $4,000-$5,000/oz in 2026. The kicker? The US government is actively looking to invest in Greenland to counter China, and Amaroq holds the keys to the region's copper and strategic minerals. **1. The Cash Flow Engine is Live** Most junior miners fail because they can't build the mine. Amaroq has crossed that bridge. * **Production Beat:** They just reported FY2025 production of \\~6,600 oz, beating the midpoint of their 6-7koz guidance. * **High Grade:** This is a narrow-vein deposit with historical grades of 18-28 g/t.High grade protects margins if prices dip. * **Phase 2 Catalyst:** The real re-rate happens in Q2 2026. They are installing a flotation circuit to boost recovery rates to \\~90%.This is pure margin expansion. **2. The Macro Setup (Gold Supercycle)** The valuation looks reasonable at current gold prices, but it looks like a steal if you believe the institutional consensus for 2026/2027: * **J.P. Morgan:** Forecasts $5,055/oz by Q4 2026. * **Bank of America:** Sees upside to $5,000/oz.If gold goes to $4,000+, Amaroq's free cash flow from the Nalunaq mine alone could likely self-fund their massive exploration portfolio, eliminating the need for dilution. **3. The Geopolitical \"Put\" Option** This is the unique value driver. The US is scrambling to secure critical minerals outside of China's control. * **Strategic Assets:** Amaroq owns the Sava Copper Belt (potential IOCG system) and Stendalen (Nickel/PGM). * **US Government Funding:** CEO Eldur Olafsson confirmed they are in discussions with US agencies regarding direct investment and infrastructure support. * **The Moat:** If the US wants Greenland's minerals, Amaroq is the primary industrial partner in the region. **Valuation & Asymmetry** The stock trades like a developer, but the risk profile has shifted to that of a producer. You are effectively paying for the gold mine and getting the copper/strategic minerals and the \"US National Security\" premium for free. **Key Risks** * **Nugget Effect:** The gold is coarse and erratic. Quarterly production will be volatile. You have to look at annual averages, not quarterly misses/beats. * **Execution:** They need to deliver Phase 2 on time (Q2 2026) to hit the 90% recovery targets. * **Logistics:** It's the Arctic. Weather can delay shipments and increase working capital requirements.",

      "selftext_processed": "Current Price GBX 123 CAD 2.29 Market Cap £580m CAD 1.06B Amaroq just transitioned from a developer to a producer beating its FY2025 production guidance during a commissioning year . You are buying a highgrade gold mine that is ramping up exactly as major banks JPM Goldman forecast gold to hit $ 4000 $ 5000oz in 2026 . The kicker The US government is actively looking to invest in Greenland to counter China and Amaroq holds the keys to the regions copper and strategic minerals . 1 . The Cash Flow Engine is Live Most junior miners fail because they cant build the mine . Amaroq has crossed that bridge . Production Beat They just reported FY2025 production of 6600 oz beating the midpoint of their 67koz guidance . High Grade This is a narrowvein deposit with historical grades of 1828 gt.High grade protects margins if prices dip . Phase 2 Catalyst The real rerate happens in Q2 2026 . They are installing a flotation circuit to boost recovery rates to 90 % .This is pure margin expansion . 2 . The Macro Setup Gold Supercycle The valuation looks reasonable at current gold prices but it looks like a steal if you believe the institutional consensus for 20262027 J.P. Morgan Forecasts $ 5055oz by Q4 2026 . Bank of America Sees upside to $ 5000oz.If gold goes to $ 4000 Amaroqs free cash flow from the Nalunaq mine alone could likely selffund their massive exploration portfolio eliminating the need for dilution . 3 . The Geopolitical Put Option This is the unique value driver . The US is scrambling to secure critical minerals outside of Chinas control . Strategic Assets Amaroq owns the Sava Copper Belt potential IOCG system and Stendalen NickelPGM . US Government Funding CEO Eldur Olafsson confirmed they are in discussions with US agencies regarding direct investment and infrastructure support . The Moat If the US wants Greenlands minerals Amaroq is the primary industrial partner in the region . Valuation Asymmetry The stock trades like a developer but the risk profile has shifted to that of a producer . You are effectively paying for the gold mine and getting the copperstrategic minerals and the US National Security premium for free . Key Risks Nugget Effect The gold is coarse and erratic . Quarterly production will be volatile . You have to look at annual averages not_quarterly missesbeats . Execution They need to deliver Phase 2 on time Q2 2026 to hit the 90 % recovery targets . Logistics Its the Arctic . Weather can delay shipments and increase working capital requirements ."

      "selftext": "Considering they are not even in the top 10 foundries by revenue in the world they strike me as a warm fuzzy play. The news cycle has made a bull case for them causing a price surge on a company that hadnt been profitable in 20 years even with the fact that they have had chips in absolutely every consumer electronics device. Operation of a foundry is cost intensive. Its why Nvidia doesn't operate one and outsources production and why AMD sold off globalfoundries to the Arab Emirates and became fabless as well. GF is the third largest in the world by revenue and has better fundamentals than Intel but is now trading at a lower price than Intel. Now you can't make money selling these things without manufacturing them so the cost of the foundry is worked into the prices so there is some discrepancy in pricing between the shares of fabless companies and the ones who are into the entire process.",

The news cycle has made a bull case for them causing a price surge on a company that hadnt been profitable in 20 years even with the fact that they have had chips in absolutely every consumer electronics device . Operation of a foundry is cost intensive . Its why Nvidia doesnt operate one and outsources production and why AMD sold off globalfoundries to the Arab Emirates and became fabless as well . GF is the third largest in the world by revenue and has better fundamentals than Intel but is now trading at a lower price than Intel . Now you cant make money selling these things without manufacturing them so the cost of the foundry is worked into the prices so there is some discrepancy in pricing between the shares of fabless companies and the ones who are into the entire process ."

      "selftext": "On January 14, spot silver surged past $92/oz, up nearly 6% on the day. New York silver also jumped about 6% to $91.57/oz. So far this year, silver is already up around 25%. The rally in precious metals has been driven by rising expectations for Fed rate cuts after the release of the December CPI data, along with ongoing physical supply shortages. I’ve also noticed industrial metals moving higher at the same time. Tin was up nearly 40% last year, and is already up more than 25% so far in 2026. Indonesia is the world’s second largest tin producer how do people view that market? Do you think this move is just a CPI-driven panic spike or is it more of a real stress test for U.S. equities with capital rotating out of stocks and into precious metals as a safe haven? Is this part of a bigger longer term trend?",

You know what is out of fashion? Competence. You know what is in fashion? Organized crime syndicates stealing off Americans to give plane tickets to foreigners so they can fly into JFK in Business Class for $35. And you know who is letting it happen? Alaska Airlines - they know *all about it* but refuses to tell anyone because they are terrified of their own stock chart. This isn't an airline. It is a distressed fintech with planes attached, run by cowards who are actively helping criminals cross the border to save their quarterly bonus. **I am Short Alaska Airlines. Here is the dirt.** But if your smooth-brains don't want to read or think, just jam this [report]( into your AI and ask it if this is the ravings of a lunatic? It will tell you to short at the double. # 1. The \"Penalty Box\" Infinite Loop (Tech is F*cked) In 2022, some poor guy had his mileage account drained so a random dude could travel in luxury. It was a last-minute ticket, and the hackers changed the notification email so the victim never knew until it was too late. ALK agreed to give his points back as a \"one-time courtesy,\" but then punished the **victim** by permanently banning them from booking online. They have to call a phone line (open 9-5) to use their own points forever. Fast forward 4 years to 2026. They haven't fixed a single line of code. It is the exact same robbery. Exact same response. Only now, hackers are running a train on Alaska. Look at the scoreboard: 370 confirmed hacks on public forums in 2025. \"370? Who cares?\" you ask, wiping Cheeto dust on your wife's boyfriend's couch. Listen to me. More than half of those came from the absolute nerdiest end of mile-sniffers. 41 came from a niche Chinese-language chat room (US Card Forum) with only 12,000 weekly visitors. That is the tip of the iceberg. If 41 guys in a tiny Chinese forum got hit, the real number across the 12 million normies who don't check their accounts daily is in the **tens of thousands**. An airline with tech so jacked they can't even stop randomers on the other side of the world from switching your email has no place in the modern world. # 2. The \"This is America\" Factor Now, I'm not a complete moron. I know how this works. Leaking 100,000s of data points and letting your best customers get beaten up as scapegoats? Ha, this is America. Nobody will care about that. Equifax leaked the whole country and the stock went up. But this is more than that. # 3. The Accounting Riddle Things gets worse. The filings around the loyalty program have got lumps all over them too. ALK Market Cap: $5.5B. ALK Loyalty Scheme Value: $12B (2024 investor day said so). Bungle the loyalty scheme, the easiest free money printer you can dream of, and everything goes with it. Watch how they show the world they have no control of it. The Q2 2025 Surprise: ALK suddenly booked a $180M spike in loyalty liabilities out of nowhere. No revenue match. Just $180M dropped from the sky. The Receivables Game: In the same quarter, their receivables from Bank of America (their credit card daddy) spiked $195M. Translation: Did Alaska tried to bill BofA for points for no reason. If they did it looks like BofA told them to pound sand. No explanation so who can say The Real Puzzle: By Q3, $120M of that receivable vanished from \"Current Assets\" and wormed its way into \"Other Non-Current Assets.\" Looks like something is being put in the basement hoping the SEC won't check the storage locker. Spoiler: They will. # 4. The Unapprehended Traveler (The Kill Shot) This is the part that should put someone in handcuffs. And make the stock rock soon. Right now - literally today - there is almost certainly a foreign national jetting in on some poor Alaskan's hard-earned miles. So hard-earned that our hero victim actually spotted it! He called up Alaska! *\"Hey! There is a thief in seat 4A flying to Seattle right now!\"* The thief must be a daredevil to take that risk, right? Wait until CBP takes him out back... **NOPE.** It doesn't happen. The thief isn't brave; he's safe. **Because Alaska never tells anyone.** There are cases where victims begged Alaska to call the police on a fraudster *who was literally in the air*, and Alaska refused. Why? Because an arrest creates a Police Report. A Police Report creates a Public Record. A Public Record proves a Data Breach. A Breach crashes the Stock. They are choosing to facilitate organized crime and border violations just to keep the share price propped up. How you think the Trumpisters gonna play this when they find out... # The Play The assets are unexplained ($180M apparition). The tech is broken (no 2FA). The governance is cowardly (hiding the breach).

You know what is out of fashion Competence . You know what is in fashion Organized crime syndicates stealing off Americans to give plane tickets to foreigners so they can fly into JFK in Business Class for $ 35 . And you know who is letting it happen Alaska Airlines they know all about it but refuses to tell anyone because they are terrified of their own stock chart . This isnt an airline . It is a distressed fintech with planes attached run by cowards who are actively helping criminals cross the border to save their quarterly bonus . I am Short Alaska Airlines . Here is the dirt . But if your smoothbrains dont want to read or think just jam this report into your AI and ask it if this is the ravings of a lunatic It will tell you to short at the double . 1 . The Penalty Box Infinite Loop Tech is Fcked In 2022 some poor guy had his mileage account drained so a random dude could travel in luxury . It was a lastminute ticket and the hackers changed the notification email so the victim never_knew until it was too late . ALK agreed to give his points back as a onetime courtesy but then punished the victim by permanently banning them from booking online . They have to call a phone line open 95 to use their own points forever . Fast forward 4 years to 2026 . They havent fixed a single line of code . It is the exact same robbery . Exact same response . Only now hackers are running a train on Alaska . Look at the scoreboard 370 confirmed hacks on public forums in 2025 . 370 Who cares you ask wiping Cheeto dust on your wifes boyfriends couch . Listen to me . More than half of those came from the absolute nerdiest end of milesniffers . 41 came from a niche Chineselanguage chat room US Card Forum with only 12000 weekly visitors . That is the tip of the iceberg . If 41 guys in a tiny Chinese forum got hit the real number across the 12 million normies who dont check their accounts daily is in the tens of thousands . An airline with tech so jacked they cant even stop randomers on the other side of the world from switching your email has no_place in the modern world . 2 . The This is America Factor Now Im not_a complete moron . I know how this works . Leaking 100000s of data points and letting your best customers get beaten up as scapegoats Ha this is America . Nobody_will care about that . Equifax leaked the whole country and the stock went up . But this is more than that . 3 . The Accounting Riddle Things gets worse . The filings around the loyalty program have got lumps all over them too . ALK Market Cap $ 5.5B . ALK Loyalty Scheme Value $ 12B 2024 investor day said so . Bungle the loyalty scheme the easiest free money printer you can dream of and everything goes with it . Watch how they show the world they have no_control of it . The Q2 2025 Surprise ALK suddenly booked a $ 180M spike in loyalty liabilities out of nowhere_No revenue match . Just $ 180M dropped from the sky . The Receivables Game In the same quarter their receivables from Bank of America their credit card daddy spiked $ 195M . Translation Did Alaska tried to bill BofA for points for no_reason . If they did it looks like BofA told them to pound sand . No_explanation so who can say The Real Puzzle By Q3 $ 120M of that receivable vanished from Current Assets and wormed its way into Other NonCurrent Assets . Looks like something is being put in the basement hoping the SEC wont check the storage locker . Spoiler They will . 4 . The Unapprehended Traveler The Kill Shot This is the part that should put someone in handcuffs . And make the stock rock soon . Right now literally today there is almost certainly a foreign national jetting in on some poor Alaskans hardearned miles . So hardearned that our hero victim actually spotted it He called up Alaska Hey There is a thief in seat 4A flying to Seattle right now The thief must be a daredevil to take that risk right Wait until CBP takes him out back ... NOPE . It doesnt happen . The thief isnt brave hes safe . Because Alaska never_tells anyone . There are cases where victims begged Alaska to call the police on a fraudster who was literally in the air and Alaska refused . Why Because an arrest creates a Police Report . A Police Report creates a Public Record . A Public Record proves a Data Breach . A Breach crashes the Stock . They are choosing to facilitate organized crime and border violations just to keep the share price propped up . How you think the Trumpisters gon na play this when they find out ... The Play The assets are unexplained $ 180M apparition . The tech is broken no 2FA . The governance is cowardly hiding the breach .

      "selftext": "I work for a \\~5000 person employee owned company, and they do annual “return of capital” where they pay out a dollar or so per share, but also reduce the share price by that same amount. Then yearly the board gets together and decides how much the new share price is going to be for the next year. I asked the generic email why they do it this way and had the CFO call me in reply, saying “would you rather have a $20 asset and $10 debt or a $10 asset and no debt” and I said I wouldn’t care, he said he disagrees and that this is how public companies do it as well. So is that how public companies do dividends/returns of capital?",

Then yearly the board gets together and decides how much the new share price is going to be for the next year . I asked the generic email why they do it this way and had the CFO call me in reply saying “ would you rather have a $ 20 asset and $ 10 debt or a $ 10 asset and no_debt ” and I said I wouldn ’ t care he said he disagrees and that this is how public companies do it as well .

      "selftext": "Russell 2000 beat the S&P again yesterday (-0.1% vs -0.19%). That's 8 straight days of outperformance - hasn't happened since January 2019. A few things driving this: 1. Valuation gap is massive. S&P 600 small caps trade at ~15.6x forward earnings vs S&P 500 at ~22.6x. That's a 31% discount. 2. Rate cut expectations. Small caps got crushed by high rates (more debt-sensitive). Fed easing helps them disproportionately. 3. Rotation out of mega-caps. The \"Magnificent 7\" trade is getting crowded. Money is finally flowing downstream. For context, large caps have outperformed small caps for 5 straight years (2020-2025). The last time that happened was 1994-1998 - which was followed by 6 straight years of small cap outperformance (1999-2004). Not saying history repeats, but the setup is interesting. The catch: Small caps are riskier. Less liquidity, weaker balance sheets, more volatility. The Russell 2000 has ~40% of companies that aren't profitable. You can't just buy blindly. If you're looking at small caps, focus on profitability, debt levels, and revenue growth. The junk rallies first in a rotation, but quality wins over time.",

      "selftext": "While tinkering around with finding good funds to invest in moving forward to slightly increase my international exposure, I came across what sounded like an agreement that FZROX was fine for pre tax accounts, but that it was ill-advised to use it for taxable accounts because it means that you can't leave fidelity without tax implications. I am invested entirely in FZROX and FZILX at the moment in my taxable accounts. 1. How concerning of a position is this? Should I make adjustments and find different no/low fee fund moving forward? I can do my own research but if the answer is yes, any fund recommendations I can use with Fidelity? 2. It's my understanding that the reason to avoid using it in taxable accounts is because it's locked into fidelity and can't be transferred, so switching brokerages requires liquidating it and realizing capital gains, then taxes. Is this the only reason why it's not recommended? 3. If the answer to 2 is yes, is it really that much of a risk to hold a fund that can't be transferred out of your brokerage without liquidating? I don't have plans to find another brokerage and it's unlikely Fidelity goes out of business. Or perhaps it's a situation where there's low upside and high downside if something very unlikely occurs? 4. I am planning to retire early. If it is the case that this was a big oopsie, I am assuming I'll begin investing in a new index fund, and simply prioritize withdrawals from the FZROX fund in the early days to decrease my allocation there over time. What else should I be thinking about if this was a large error? Cheers, and thanks for your help!",

I am invested entirely in FZROX and FZILX at the moment in my taxable accounts . 1 . How concerning of a position is this Should I make adjustments and find different nolow_fee fund moving forward I can do my own research but if the answer is yes any fund recommendations I can use with Fidelity 2 . Its my understanding that the reason to avoid using it in taxable accounts is because its locked into fidelity and cant be transferred so switching brokerages requires liquidating it and realizing capital gains then taxes . Is this the only reason why its not_recommended 3 . If the answer to 2 is yes is it really that much of a risk to hold a fund that cant be transferred out of your brokerage without liquidating I dont have plans to find another brokerage and its unlikely Fidelity goes out of business . Or perhaps its a situation where theres low upside and high downside if something very unlikely occurs 4 . I am planning to retire early . If it is the case that this was a big oopsie I am assuming Ill begin investing in a new index fund and simply prioritize withdrawals from the FZROX fund in the early days to decrease my allocation there over time . What else should I be thinking about if this was a large error Cheers and thanks for your help"

      "selftext": "Will there be an AI bubble peak? Yes. Every breakthrough technology has had over investment. Has AI bubble peaked? If you keep reading mainstream media, r/stocks, and listening to Michael Burry, you'd believe it. You'd be losing a lot of money though. **Real demand is through the roof:** * H100 prices recovering to highest in 8 months. This is a clear indicator that Burry's claim that old GPUs become useless faster than expected is wrong. Source mvcinvesting @ X. Can't post link here due to X being banned. * Burry’s logic to short Nvidia is especially dumb. So he short Nvidia because he thinks old GPUs will be obsolete faster than expected because new Nvidia GPUs will be so much better. If companies all buy Nvidia’s new GPUs, Nvidia wins. If no one buys Nvidia’s new GPUs, then there is no faster than expected obsoletion. You can’t have rapid obsoletion of old GPUs without buying a ton of new Nvidia GPUs. Do people not see the glaring paradox? Burry’s short reason is completely illogical. The only reason to short Nvidia is if you think demand for compute will fall. We’re clearly not seeing this. * China's Alibaba Justin Lin just said they're severely constrained by inference demand. He said Tencent is the same. They simply do not have compute to meet user demand. They're having to use their precious compute for inference which does not leave enough to train new models to keep up with Americans. Their models are falling behind American ones for this reason. Source: * Google says they need to double compute every 6 months to meet demand. Source: * You can clearly see the accelerating AI demand from OpenAI’s reported revenue numbers. OpenAI is already at $20b/year in revenue and without monetizing their free users. In 2024, their revenue grew by 2.5x. In 2025, their revenue grew by 4x. So it's not slowing down. If they grow 4x again in 2026, they're already at $100b/year in revenue. Sources: Notice how compute is always followed by \"demand\". It's real demand. It's not a circular economy. It's truly real user demand. Listen to people actually are close to AI demand. They're all saying they're compute constrained. Literally everyone does not have enough compute. Every software developer has experienced unreliable inference when using Anthropic's Claude models because Anthropic simply does not have enough compute to meet demand. **So why is demand increasing?** * Because contrary to popular belief on Reddit, AI is tremendously useful even at the current intelligence level. Every large company I know is building agents to increase productivity and efficiency. Every small company I know is using some form of AI whether it's ChatGPT or video gen or software that has added LLM support. * Models are getting smarter faster. It’s not slowing down. It’s accelerating. In the last 6 months, GPT5, Gemini 3, and Claude 4.5 have increased capabilities faster than expected. The intelligence graph is now exponential, not linear. Source 1: Source 2: * There are reasons to believe that the next generation of foundational models from OpenAI and Anthropic will accelerate again. GPT5 and Claude 4.5 were still trained on H100 GPUs or H100-class chips. The next gen will be trained on Blackwell GPUs. * LLMs aren't just chat bots anymore. They're trading stocks, doing automated analysis, writing apps from scratch, solving previously unsolved math conjectures, and is already showing signs of self improvement (read what people in industry are saying last few months on self improvement). The token usage has exploded. If you think LLMs are still just used for chatting about cooking recipes or summarizing emails, you are truly missing the forest for the trees. * AI models are becoming so smart that they’re starting to solve previously unsolved math problems. Here’s Terence Tao, one of the smartest humans alive and a child math prodigy, explaining how GPT 5.2 solved an Erdos math problem: * There is a reason US productivity grew faster than expected in Q3 2025 and is accelerating. Productivity has grown the fastest since 2023 when Covid mostly ended. Source: At some point, the AI bubble will peak. Anyone who thought it peaked in 2025 is seriously going to regret it. When it does pop, it's still going to be bigger than it was in 2025. The world will not use less AI or require less compute than 2025. We're going to have exponential increase in AI demand. If you’re still skittish about investing in AI stocks, then just invest in S&P500. All companies will benefit from AI productivity boost. Do not stay out of the market because you think the AI bubble will burst soon. Stop listening to the mass media on AI. They’re always anti-tech. Always. They were anti-tech before AI boom. They will be after. Negative stories get views and engagement. Follow the people who are actually working on AI. I’ll close with this: Railroad bubble in the US peaked at 6% of GDP spend. AI is at 1% right now.",

      "selftext_processed": "Will there be an AI bubble peak Yes . Every breakthrough technology has had over investment . Has AI bubble peaked If you keep reading mainstream media rstocks and listening to Michael Burry youd believe it . Youd be losing a lot of money though . Real demand is through the roof H100 prices recovering to highest in 8 months . This is a clear indicator that Burrys claim that old GPUs become useless faster than expected is wrong . Source mvcinvesting X. Cant post link here due to X being banned . Burry ’ s logic to short Nvidia is especially dumb . So he short Nvidia because he thinks old GPUs will be obsolete faster than expected because new Nvidia GPUs will be so much better . If companies all buy Nvidia ’ s new GPUs Nvidia wins . If no_one buys Nvidia ’ s new GPUs then there is no_faster than expected obsoletion . You can ’ t have rapid obsoletion of old GPUs without buying a ton of new Nvidia GPUs . Do people not_see the glaring paradox Burry ’ s short reason is completely illogical . The only reason to short Nvidia is if you think demand for compute will fall . We ’ re clearly not_seeing this . Chinas Alibaba Justin Lin just said theyre severely constrained by inference demand . He said Tencent is the same . They simply do not_have compute to meet user demand . Theyre having to use their precious compute for inference which does not_leave enough to train new models to keep up with Americans . Their models are falling behind American ones for this reason . Source Google says they need to double compute every 6 months to meet demand . Source You can clearly see the accelerating AI demand from OpenAI ’ s reported revenue numbers . OpenAI is already at $ 20byear in revenue and without monetizing their free users . In 2024 their revenue grew by 2.5x . In 2025 their revenue grew by 4x . So its not_slowing down . If they grow 4x again in 2026 theyre already at $ 100byear in revenue . Sources Notice how compute is always followed by demand . Its real demand . Its not_a circular economy . Its truly real user demand . Listen to people actually are close to AI demand . Theyre all saying theyre compute constrained . Literally everyone does not_have enough compute . Every software developer has experienced unreliable inference when using Anthropics Claude models because Anthropic simply does not_have enough compute to meet demand . So why is demand increasing Because contrary to popular belief on Reddit AI is tremendously useful even at the current intelligence level . Every large company I know is building agents to increase productivity and efficiency . Every small company I know is using some form of AI whether its ChatGPT or video gen or software that has added LLM support . Models are getting smarter faster . It ’ s not_slowing down . It ’ s accelerating . In the last 6 months GPT5 Gemini 3 and Claude 4.5 have increased capabilities faster than expected . The intelligence graph is now exponential not_linear . Source 1 Source 2 There are reasons to believe that the next generation of foundational models from OpenAI and Anthropic will accelerate again . GPT5 and Claude 4.5 were still trained on H100 GPUs or H100class chips . The next gen will be trained on Blackwell GPUs . LLMs arent just chat bots anymore . Theyre trading stocks doing automated analysis writing apps from scratch solving previously unsolved math conjectures and is already showing signs of self improvement read what people in industry are saying last few months on self improvement . The token usage has exploded . If you think LLMs are still just used for chatting about cooking recipes or summarizing emails you are truly missing the forest for the trees . AI models are becoming so smart that they ’ re starting to solve previously unsolved math problems . Here ’ s Terence Tao one of the smartest humans alive and a child math prodigy explaining how GPT 5.2 solved an Erdos math problem There is a reason US productivity grew faster than expected in Q3 2025 and is accelerating . Productivity has grown the fastest since 2023 when Covid mostly ended . Source At some point the AI bubble will peak . Anyone who thought it peaked in 2025 is seriously going to regret it . When it does pop its still going to be bigger than it was in 2025 . The world will not_use less AI or require less compute than 2025 . Were going to have exponential increase in AI demand . If you ’ re still skittish about investing in AI stocks then just invest in SP500 . All companies will benefit from AI productivity boost . Do not_stay out of the market because you think the AI bubble will burst soon . Stop listening to the mass media on AI . They ’ re always antitech . Always . They were antitech before AI boom . They will be after . Negative stories get views and engagement . Follow the people who are actually working on AI . I ’ ll close with this Railroad bubble in the US peaked at 6 % of GDP spend . AI is at 1 % right now ."

      "selftext": "Czech defence firm Czechoslovak Group (CSG) on Wednesday announced its intention to float shares on Euronext Amsterdam in an initial public offering comprising both existing and new shares in what may be one of Europe's biggest IPOs this year. CSG said in a statement the offering was expected to take place in the coming weeks and would consist of new shares for 750 million euros ($873.60 million) and an amount of existing shares to be determined at a later stage. CSG, one of the world's fastest-growing defence firms which counts the Ukrainian military among its customers, said it will use proceeds from the sale of new shares for general corporate purposes. Sources have told Reuters the IPO could raise more than 3 billion euros ($3.50 billion), which would make CSG Amsterdam's largest IPO since InPost in 2021, which raised $3.9 billion, according to Dealogic data.

      "selftext": "**USAR: 90% convinced, need a gut check before sizing up** Started a small position today at $16.58. Everything says this should be bigger. Talk me out of it. **What they do:** USA Rare Earth owns Round Top Mountain in Texas. Only major domestic deposit of heavy rare earths - dysprosium and terbium. These go into every F-35 (920 lbs per plane), EV motor, wind turbine, missile guidance system. China controls 99% of global heavy rare earth processing. **Why now:** * Trump talking about Greenland for rare earth deposits * China suspended export controls until November 2026. When they come back, this becomes critical infrastructure * Stillwater, Oklahoma magnet facility starts production Q1 2026 * Acquired Less Common Metals for $100M in November - only scaled rare earth metal producer outside China **Numbers:** * $5.56 to $43.98 in 2025, now $16-17. Down 60% from highs * $2.5B market cap. MP Materials is $10B with $400M DoD backing * Pre-revenue, burning $10-15M quarterly, $523M cash * All Buy ratings, average target $23 **Bull case:** * MP got $400M government equity. USAR CEO says \"in close communication with administration\" * Round Top is 70% heavy rare earths. MP is light rare earths. Different products, both needed * Stillwater revenue starts Q1 2026. First proof they can produce * China export restrictions return November 2026 **Bear case:** * Stillwater was supposed to produce in 2023, now 2026 * 211% dilution in 2025. More coming * MP already operational, profitable, government-backed * No confirmed government money yet **What I need:** Am I missing something on the bear case? Is dilution worse than I think? Wait for Stillwater confirmation? **Position:** 257 shares at $16.58. Considering 500-1000 more to hit 5-7% of portfolio.",

      "selftext": "Recently added position in UAMY. Dropping my DD. Thesis in short: UAMY is moving from being a raw material buyer to a vertically integrated domestic producer, a shift that management expects to triple profit margins from 20% to \\~60%. 2026 revenue guidance is recently raised to $125 million and the Thompson Falls smelter expansion coming online this month to increase output fivefold, the fundamental floor significantly higher than in previous years. Wall Street remains bullish, with a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating and an average price target of $9.86 to $17, representing a \\~30% to 120% upside from current levels. Currently a 17.86% short interest is attempting to break the momentum of a massive institutional accumulation phase. Retention of price levels in the $7-8 range is likely to result in a gamma/short squeeze pushing the stock beyond $11. Stoch RSI is oversold, and relief rally to squeeze shorts should be imminent. Western Antimony supply is highly limited. UAMY is a strategic geopolitical stock pick, critical for defense, and is unlikely to see Antimony-specific China export ban repealed. US law will require defense to use non-Chinese sourced antimony - a big UAMY tailwind, as the only active smelter and refiner. 🍀🥸 $UAMY GL.",

      "selftext": "I bring this up due to the recent mentions of a drug patent cliff mentioned by CNBC, Globe and Mail, and Brownstone Research that will affect many of the big pharmaceutical companies. Is this as concerning for them as it's made out to be or is it just noise? There was a surge in biotech during covid, but that was because of covid. This one is more related to loss of profits. If it is as detrimental as it sounds then what companies do you guys think would benefit from this? Im not very familiar in what big pharma looks for when acquiring small cap biotech, but I've seen mentions of investments in oncology and weightloss drugs. Sellas is the name that's been hyped on this past month and I found it to be a coincidence that they're gearing up to be a solid buy out candidate at the same time the patent cliff is about to hit. I only mention sellas because they're one of the few biotechs that legitimately feels like they can execute based on the past trial data and current ongoing trial. I used them as a frame of reference, however, that's not the point. I want to know if there is a legitimate benefit for microcaps or small caps from the upcoming patent cliff. What're your picks if you do expect a cliff and just give a quick summary about the drug as well. Late-stage picks would make the most sense, early or mid stage isn't even in contention because of how unpredictable they are.",

Is this as concerning for them as its made out to be or is it just noise There was a surge in biotech during covid but that was because of covid . This one is more related to loss of profits . If it is as detrimental as it sounds then what companies do you guys think would benefit from this Im not_very familiar in what big pharma looks for when acquiring small cap biotech but Ive seen mentions of investments in oncology and weightloss drugs . Sellas is the name thats been hyped on this past month and I found it to be a coincidence that theyre gearing up to be a solid buy out candidate at the same time the patent cliff is about to hit . I only mention sellas because theyre one of the few biotechs that legitimately feels like they can execute based on the past trial data and current ongoing trial . I used them as a frame of reference however thats not_the point . I want to know if there is a legitimate benefit for microcaps or small caps from the upcoming patent cliff . Whatre your picks if you do expect a cliff and just give a quick summary about the drug as well . Latestage picks would make the most sense early or mid stage isnt even in contention because of how unpredictable they are ."

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’ve been reading a lot of posts on Reddit lately about platforms like eToro, Interactive Brokers, Trading212, etc., with people reporting things like: - accounts being frozen or closed; - slow or unresponsive customer service; - difficulty withdrawing funds; - limited explanations during “reviews”. As a long-term retail investor, this honestly makes me uneasy. Many of us are investing years of savings, trusting these platforms to hold our assets while we build wealth over decades. I’m trying to separate real systemic risk from isolated cases, compliance issues, and I’d really appreciate hearing from more experienced investors. Some genuine questions I have: What actual legal protections do retail investors have if a broker freezes or closes an account? How safe are client assets if a platform fails or is hacked? Are shares truly segregated and recoverable in practice? - What practical steps do experienced investors take to reduce platform risk? (multiple brokers, record-keeping, etc.) I’m not trying to bash any broker, just trying to understand how this works in the real world beyond marketing pages. Would love to hear: Personal experiences good or bad; Insights from people who’ve dealt with compliance reviews; Views from anyone with legal, regulatory, or professional investing background. Let’s keep it constructive, I think this is something a lot of quiet investors worry about but don’t always ask. Thanks in advance",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone I ’ ve been reading a lot of posts on Reddit lately about platforms like eToro Interactive Brokers Trading212 etc . with people reporting things like accounts being frozen or closed slow or unresponsive customer service difficulty withdrawing funds limited explanations during “ reviews ” . As a longterm retail investor this honestly makes me uneasy . Many of us are investing years of savings trusting these platforms to hold our assets while we build wealth over decades . I ’ m trying to separate real systemic risk from isolated cases compliance issues and I ’ d really appreciate hearing from more experienced investors . Some genuine questions I have What actual legal protections do retail investors have if a broker freezes or closes an account How safe are client assets if a platform fails or is hacked Are shares truly segregated and recoverable in practice What practical steps do experienced investors take to reduce platform risk multiple brokers recordkeeping etc . I ’ m not_trying to bash any broker just trying to understand how this works in the real world beyond marketing pages . Would love to hear Personal experiences good or bad Insights from people who ’ ve dealt with compliance reviews Views from anyone with legal regulatory or professional investing background . Let ’ s keep it constructive I think this is something a lot of quiet investors worry about but don ’ t always ask . Thanks in advance"

      "selftext": "Secretary of Defense, Hegseth’s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports. \"While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,\" Hegseth said in the video online. \"Not anymore.\" The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by \"approving hundreds of American products\" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a \"variety of low-cost drones\" made by American engineers and AI experts. The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use. \"Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,\" the memo said. Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars. \"Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,\" Hegseth wrote in the memo. The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace. In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones part of the SRR contract, which the budget has increased from 70M to 800M. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue. Following news today, RedCat’s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat’s drones. They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options a few months ago. In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue. There is also speculation that RedCat’s Black Widow involving its visual navigation thanks to Palantir strategic partnership was used to help capture Maduro with its anti-jamming technology. They are also tapping in the USV, which I’m sure you’ve heard about as many russian vessels were taken down by these sea drones. Guess which compared acquired that exact product known as the Magura7 and started production in its brand new facility in Georgia? Yup. RedCat. TLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract. Has connections to current administration. Approved for NATO. Tapped into USV industry. Speculating to be used for the capture of Maduro. 1,800% YoY increase in revenue I am 15k shares long.",

      "selftext_processed": "Secretary of Defense Hegseth ’ s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no_brainer . The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies . It also assigns to combat units authority to buy test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes according to reports . While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape Hegseth said in the video online . Not anymore . The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by approving hundreds of American products for military purchase . It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry . The DOD plans to arm combat units with a variety of lowcost drones made by American engineers and AI experts . The order will also expand the Blue List of DODapproved unmanned drones components and software as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency according to reports . The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use . Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops the memo said . Lastly the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year which includes forceonforce drone wars . Lethality will not_be hindered by selfimposed restrictions especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue Hegseth wrote in the memo . The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace . In December alone they delivered 641 systemsdrones part of the SRR contract which the budget has increased from 70M to 800M . And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1800 % YoY revenue . Following news today RedCat ’ s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat ’ s drones . They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options a few months ago . In December alone they delivered 641 systemsdrones . And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1800 % YoY revenue . There is also speculation that RedCat ’ s Black Widow involving its visual navigation thanks to Palantir strategic partnership was used to help capture Maduro with its antijamming technology . They are also tapping in the USV which I ’ m sure you ’ ve heard about as many russian vessels were taken down by these sea drones . Guess which compared acquired that exact product known as the Magura7 and started production in its brand new facility in Georgia Yup . RedCat . TLDR Drone warfare is here . American drone dominance is here . Plan to outpace China which means $ $ $ $ $ for drone industry . RedCat won SRR contract beating 30 competitors for it . Meeting the supply demand for the contract . Has connections to current administration . Approved for NATO . Tapped into USV industry . Speculating to be used for the capture of Maduro . 1800 % YoY increase in revenue I am 15k shares long ."

And, especially, I feel there are more companies getting listed now, and back then only the solid one would make it. Not that it prevented them from falling or failing, but at least there was more structure to that. So… I'm not implying that “**stocks are dead**” as I'm quite invested in that. Just wondering if we’re confusing a great historical run with a permanent law of nature. * Are stocks **still** “the best” because they’re inherently superior, or because the system is now designed to keep them afloat? * Do future returns look anything like the past? * Or are we just anchoring to a history that will not repeat so similarly? * Where does Crypto sit in this equation? And especially: * What other asset, if not stocks, would you see as a winner - or at least as a close competitor to Stocks?",

      "selftext": "At first glance, news of a criminal probe involving the Fed Chair sounds like something that should shake markets. Yet equities have barely reacted. One reason is that markets care more about policy than personalities. Investors are focused on interest rates, liquidity, and inflation trends, not headlines, unless those headlines threaten a shift in monetary policy. Another factor is institutional continuity. The Federal Reserve doesn’t hinge on one individual. Even if investigations make noise, markets assume the Fed’s policy framework and decision making process remain intact. As long as rate expectations and economic data don’t change, risk assets tend to stay supported. In short, the market is signaling confidence that the probe won’t disrupt monetary policy or financial stability. Until that assumption changes, traders are likely to keep prioritizing earnings, inflation data, and rate cut timing over political or legal drama.",

      "selftext_processed": "At first glance news of a criminal probe involving the Fed Chair sounds like something that should shake markets . Yet equities have barely reacted . One reason is that markets care more about policy than personalities . Investors are focused on interest rates liquidity and inflation trends not_headlines unless those headlines threaten a shift in monetary policy . Another factor is institutional continuity . The Federal Reserve doesn ’ t hinge on one individual . Even if investigations make noise markets assume the Fed ’ s policy framework and decision making process remain intact . As long as rate expectations and economic data don ’ t change risk assets tend to stay supported . In short the market is signaling confidence that the probe won ’ t disrupt monetary policy or financial stability . Until that assumption changes traders are likely to keep prioritizing earnings inflation data and rate cut timing over political or legal drama ."

The deal puts Google’s Gemini models directly into Apple’s ecosystem, which is a pretty significant distribution win given Apple’s user base. From a stock perspective, I’m curious how much of this is already priced in. Alphabet has been on a strong run over the past year, driven by AI optimism, ad recovery, and cloud growth. At $4T, expectations are obviously very high.

Their product innovation is stale AF - they used to drop fire every presentation now they just show the same phone with a new screen. The design is boring. Risk averse and ripe to be disrupted - you even look at small British companies like Nothing and think well at least they are trying to drop some new design or features with the AMOLED and lights all over it even though it is a minor tweak. Apple has no tweaks. I don't see or hear anything in their product pipeline that is particularly exciting. When is the last time Apple dropped something revolutionary where you are like 'damn I am gonna buy that'? What is even the growth part of their business, they don't even do AWS type shit as far as I know?",

Risk averse and ripe to be disrupted you even look at small British companies like Nothing_and think well at least they are trying to drop some new design or features with the AMOLED and lights all over it even though it is a minor tweak . Apple has no_tweaks . I dont see or hear anything in their product pipeline that is particularly exciting . When is the last time Apple dropped something revolutionary where you are like damn I am gon na buy that What is even the growth part of their business they dont even do AWS type shit as far as I know"

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m looking for some friends around my age (50 and above) who enjoy discussing stocks and investment strategies in their spare time. I believe that with years of trading experience, there’s a lot of wisdom and unique perspectives to share, and I’m eager to exchange ideas and learn from others. A little about myself: I’m 60 years old and have been trading for quite a while. About 50% of my portfolio is in blue chip stocks, but I also like to experiment with growth stocks, tech stocks, and even some small-cap stocks (I know it’s quite aggressive for me, but I keep it within what I’m comfortable with). I’m looking for like minded friends to chat with and perhaps exchange some investment strategies and stocks we’re bullish on. And if we happen to be in the same city, grabbing a drink together would be a great option too!",

What most investors are not considering is how these companies make money... They don't issue the debt. They make money everytime a phone is tapped, a chip is read, or a card is swiped. Visa and MasterCard run the connective network between banks and merchants allowing consumers to pay anywhere. So, more swipes equal bigger revenue for Visa and MC. Now the banks... They would be rightly fucked over by a forced 10% cap. That will hit their revenues even if people use more credit. So, buying opportunity alert for when the dust settles and all the finance billionaires get ahold of Trump to make their case for walking back his suggestion. Even if this 10% cap becomes reality, Visa and MC will be just fine.",

What most investors are not_considering is how these companies make money ... They dont issue the debt . They make money everytime a phone is tapped a chip is read or a card is swiped . Visa and MasterCard run the connective network between banks and merchants allowing consumers to pay anywhere . So more swipes equal bigger revenue for Visa and MC . Now the banks ... They would be rightly fucked over by a forced 10 % cap . That will hit their revenues even if people use more credit . So buying opportunity alert for when the dust settles and all the finance billionaires get ahold of Trump to make their case for walking back his suggestion . Even if this 10 % cap becomes reality Visa and MC will be just fine ."

Based on some quick research, here is roughly what I’m thinking but would love to hear feedback / advice. Mainly looking at fidelity ETFs that seem to have no or little management fees: 50% FZROX (basically VOO but no fees?) 20% FZILX (international emerging markets with no fees) 20% FTEC (fidelity tech etf) 10% FESM (fidelity small cap) What are your thoughts on this? And since I will start with all cash, do I dump it in all at once or should I space out my buys over something like a 6 month period? It’s roughly 70k USD. Thank you in advance",

Sosnoff isnt a tech skeptic . In fact hes a fan of the product . He likened Nvidias NVDA AI platforms to having a genius best friend with a 165 IQ available at all times . The problem he argues is that Nvidia is now totally fully priced ."

      "selftext": "Just dumped £100 into the most mentioned/favourited stocks from [this post]( I went through the comments and tried adjusting the weights based on number of mentions / number of upvotes. Don't think about it too much. Depending how my finances are this year I might dump in £100 every month as a DCA so it's at least over £1k across the year to make it more interesting. I'm not planning on rebalancing as I'd prefer to double down on the winners since I expect some of this will probably go to 0. This list is: * NBIS – Nebius Group NV - 10% * KRKNF – Kraken Robotics - 10% * ASX – ASE Technology - 8% * AMD – Advanced Micro Devices - 6% * FSLR – First Solar - 6% * EOSE – Eos Energy Enterprises - 6% * SLS – SELLAS Life Sciences - 6% * CLS – Celestica - 6% * MU – Micron Technology - 5% * ONDS – Ondas - 5% * PL – Planet Labs - 5% * IREN – IREN - 5% * LUNR – Intuitive Machines - 5% * APLD – Applied Digital - 5% * AMPX – Amprius Technologies - 5% * RZLV – Rezolve AI - 4% * SMR – NuScale Power - 3% Since I'm in the UK I'm using £ and therefore currency exchange does apply. I have made this into a [pie]( on Trading 212 for those in Europe and interested or those stupid enough to join. This is not something I expect to go particularly well and not something I would recommend. I understand this is very very dumb, but I figure it'd be fun to look back on this in 12 months time as I love looking at whacky trading strategies. [Edited to add] I've already got investments in ASTS which is why I haven't bothered with that",

Dont think about it too much . Depending how my finances are this year I might dump in £100 every month as a DCA so its at least over £1k across the year to make it more interesting . Im not_planning on rebalancing as Id prefer to double down on the winners since I expect some of this will probably go to 0 . This list is NBIS – Nebius Group NV 10 % KRKNF – Kraken Robotics 10 % ASX – ASE Technology 8 % AMD – Advanced Micro Devices 6 % FSLR – First Solar 6 % EOSE – Eos Energy Enterprises 6 % SLS – SELLAS Life Sciences 6 % CLS – Celestica 6 % MU – Micron Technology 5 % ONDS – Ondas 5 % PL – Planet Labs 5 % IREN – IREN 5 % LUNR – Intuitive Machines 5 % APLD – Applied Digital 5 % AMPX – Amprius Technologies 5 % RZLV – Rezolve AI 4 % SMR – NuScale Power 3 % Since Im in the UK Im using £ and therefore currency exchange does apply . I have made this into a pie on Trading 212 for those in Europe and interested or those stupid enough to join . This is not_something I expect to go particularly well and not_something I would recommend . I understand this is very very dumb but I figure itd be fun to look back on this in 12 months time as I love looking at whacky trading strategies . Edited to add Ive already got investments in ASTS which is why I havent bothered with that"

I only ever throw a small amount of money at them, nothing more than I am completely fine losing 100% of. In this case, I purchased $RGTI one time almost exactly a year ago and my current return is 139.74%. Initially I wanted to get into AI, but figured I was too late for any significant gains so I started looking at quantum and kinda just picked $RGTI at random. The problem is that I don’t really see this as a long term hold. I have a couple other positions like this, but not nearly as good of a return. So what can I do with these stocks that I see as popular right now, but not in the future? Do I just set a return value in my head that I would like to see and then sell once I hit that? I’ve never sold any positions before so any advice would be helpful, thanks.",

      "selftext": "Hello, Investors: I am going to set up a brokerage account this year to house saved funds for my soon-to-be-born daughter's college fund, and \"retirement\" funds for my wife and me. All of my experience with the stock market is in swing trading individual tickers (no options, futures, forex or crypto), which has been very successful for me. But I see swing trading as a way to pull funds out of the market (income), and not a a smart way to store wealth for long term growth (savings). My plan is to pick one broad spectrum ETF and to DCA into that one ticker for the next 18 (for college fund) to 30 (for \"retirement\" fund) years. I personally think it is a waste of money for us to use a financial planner since I have educated myself on the markets, and long-term family planning. Currently I am torn between VT and VTI. Do you have any opinion on either ETF? Please share your opinions on which ETFs you have experience with, and any experience you have had with a similar plan. Also, please let me know if it looks like I am missing something here. I don't want to fall into a trap just because I don't know what I don't know. NOTE: I am not seeking any *advice*. I am merely curious as to your experiences and opinions so that I can use that information as another data point in my research and planning. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great day.",

      "selftext": "Everyone is chasing their tails over Hyundai, Nvidia, and Tesla, but SoftBank ($SFTBY) is sitting in the perfect spot for a massive breakout. Here is the lowdown on why I'm loading up at **$13.85**. # They still own the \"Cool\" part of Boston Dynamics Hyundai gets all the headlines, but SoftBank still holds a **20% stake**. At CES 2026, the new autonomous warehouse tech and the electric Atlas showed that these robots are finally ready for real-world work. If Boston Dynamics goes public, that 20% stake alone makes the current stock price look like a joke. # They have \"Skin in the Game\" everywhere Through the Vision Fund, SoftBank has built an AI empire. They aren't just betting on one horse; they own the whole track. From the chips (ARM) to the brains (OpenAI) to the muscle (Robotics), they are exposed to every single layer of the AI stack. # The Price is a Steal $SFTBY is trading around **$14**, down from its highs of $20+. While Tesla and Nvidia are priced for perfection, SoftBank is trading at a massive discount. It’s an easy entry point for retail investors who missed the first AI boat. # They’re back on \"Offense\" Masa Son (the CEO) recently signaled they are done playing defense. With their massive investment in OpenAI and new partnerships in AI energy infrastructure, they are positioning themselves to be the biggest winner of the \"AI re-rating\" this year. # The Bottom Line If you think robotics and AI are the next trillion-dollar themes, SoftBank is basically a giant Venture Capital fund you can buy on the cheap. The risk? It’s volatile. The reward? Asymmetric as hell. **DYOR (Do Your Own Research), but I’m adding small here.**",

Here is the lowdown on why Im loading up at $ 13.85 . They still own the Cool part of Boston Dynamics Hyundai gets all the headlines but SoftBank still holds a 20 % stake . At CES 2026 the new autonomous warehouse tech and the electric Atlas showed that these robots are finally ready for realworld work . If Boston Dynamics goes public that 20 % stake alone makes the current stock price look like a joke . They have Skin in the Game everywhere Through the Vision Fund SoftBank has built an AI empire . They arent just betting on one horse they own the whole track . From the chips ARM to the brains OpenAI to the muscle Robotics they are exposed to every single layer of the AI stack . The Price is a Steal $ SFTBY is trading around $ 14 down from its highs of $ 20 . While Tesla and Nvidia are priced for perfection SoftBank is trading at a massive discount . It ’ s an easy entry point for retail investors who missed the first AI boat . They ’ re back on Offense Masa Son the CEO recently signaled they are done playing defense . With their massive investment in OpenAI and new partnerships in AI energy infrastructure they are positioning themselves to be the biggest winner of the AI rerating this year . The Bottom Line If you think robotics and AI are the next trilliondollar themes SoftBank is basically a giant Venture Capital fund you can buy on the cheap . The risk It ’ s volatile . The reward Asymmetric as hell . DYOR Do Your Own Research but I ’ m adding small here ."

      "title": "UBER fears caused by AVs is the same story as Seaech Ai fears was for Google",
      "selftext": "$UBER is currently pretty beaten down due to AV (Autonomous Vehicle) fears. It’s currently trading at a Forward P/E of x25. The market is pricing $UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy. I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year, where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly, fears of search AI taking over Google search. In a similar fashion, I believe AV is not here as Uber’s competition, rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV’s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact. Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo, and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together. Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US, with 1 city partnering with Lyft, 2 with Uber, and the remaining 2 with themselves, constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution, market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out. If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it, the upside story looks quite convincing. This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not end up being a winner take all market, rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player. But with the TAM for AVs being so large, and the payback period for AVs being so high currently, it’ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does. I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement, hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 30-35P/E as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets. Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out, and Uber is left in the dust with no partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out, so will their gross bookings. However, I’m not particularly worried. They’ve partnered with Nvidia, they’ve partnered with Avride, Costco, hell even Sephora. Feels like something will stick. TLDR: AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor.",

[Position: 4 LEAPS, waiting for multiples expansion to take profit]( Yes I know their current P/E of \\~10 is fake due to tax reasons. TLDR: Buy Uber, AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor.",

The market is pricing $ UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy . I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly fears of search AI taking over Google search . In a similar fashion I believe AV is not_here as Uber ’ s competition rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV ’ s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact . Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together . Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US with 1 city partnering with Lyft 2 with Uber and the remaining 2 with themselves constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out . If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it the upside story looks quite convincing . This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not_end up being a winner take all market rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player . But with the TAM for AVs being so large and the payback period for AVs being so high currently it ’ ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does . I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 3035PE as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets . Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out and Uber is left in the dust with no_partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out so will their gross bookings . However I ’ m not_particularly worried . They ’ ve partnered with Nvidia they ’ ve partnered with Avride Costco even Sephora . Feels like something will stick . Position 4 LEAPS waiting for multiples expansion to take profit Yes I know their current PE of 10 is fake due to tax reasons . TLDR Buy Uber AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor ."

At the same time, yields are still elevated, so it doesn’t really feel like conditions are getting easier. A few things that stand out to me: 1. Strength feels narrow, not broad 2. Earnings expectations seem ahead of actual earnings 3. Volatility is very low despite obvious macro risks Not trying to call a top or say “crash incoming.” I’m still mostly invested, just more cautious than usual and holding more cash than I normally would. Is this just normal rotation under the surface? Or are yields quietly signaling something equities are ignoring?",

Volatility is very low despite obvious macro risks Not_trying to call a top or say “ crash incoming. ” I ’ m still mostly invested just more cautious than usual and holding more cash than I normally would .

      "selftext": "Obviously both stocks have performed well (Uber up almost 300% from its 2022 trough and Google doubling from its low in the last 12 months). But with Waymo hitting over 14 million trips in 2025 and expanding to more urban centres in 2026 there’s clearly a heap of operational momentum there. What I can’t figure out is how Uber maintains its current valuation in an autonomous driving world? Seems like we’re definitely headed that way. And currently Uber takes a cut of the drivers fee by providing access to a pool of riders, while the driver provides the car, time, bears the risk, etc. If AV’s displace drivers, and since Uber doesn’t have its own self driving tech, then it would have to licence that tech or buy the cars that had it installed. But in that same world, the developer of that tech (Waymo / Google) would be more likely to monetise its first mover advantage and intellectual property and keep the profits for itself (no licensing). I know you can book a Waymo through the Uber app at the moment, but I kind of see that as Waymo just testing out different routes to market alongside its own app. When it reaches scale why would a customer use Uber over Waymo if a Waymo was a cheaper, safer option (both supported by current data). I’m sure I’m getting this wrong somehow or thinking about it wrong so keen to hear others thoughts on all this.",

      "selftext_processed": "Obviously both stocks have performed well Uber up almost 300 % from its 2022 trough and Google doubling from its low in the last 12 months . But with Waymo hitting over 14 million trips in 2025 and expanding to more urban centres in 2026 there ’ s clearly a heap of operational momentum there . What I can ’ t figure out is how Uber maintains its current valuation in an autonomous driving world Seems like we ’ re definitely headed that way . And currently Uber takes a cut of the drivers fee by providing access to a pool of riders while the driver provides the car time bears the risk etc . If AV ’ s displace drivers and since Uber doesn ’ t have its own self driving tech then it would have to licence that tech or buy the cars that had it installed . But in that same world the developer of that tech Waymo Google would be more likely to monetise its first mover advantage and intellectual property and keep the profits for itself no licensing . I know you can book a Waymo through the Uber app at the moment but I kind of see that as Waymo just testing out different routes to market alongside its own app . When it reaches scale why would a customer use Uber over Waymo if a Waymo was a cheaper safer option both supported by current data . I ’ m sure I ’ m getting this wrong somehow or thinking about it wrong so keen to hear others thoughts on all this ."

One thing that I really dont see talked about is the emotional aspect of investing . I am investing my own money I dont have a trust fund or come from a rich family that can give me the money to try my hand at this . That saying the greed the fear and all the other emotions still creep it . I have sold early more times than I care to admit and have kept the stock open longer than I should . Beacuse It will climb some more Have you found something that helps you with this Anyone keen on sharing"

      "selftext": "I burned my graduation money for college and my career. I started trading October of 2023, probably the best time to get in the market before our huge rally’s. I was 18, and had the typical “i can beat the market” mindset. My friend helped me get into it, he only had about a year of experience but was a much safer investor. We both started with 1k, although he shortly added almost his entire savings into it (around 10k). Me being new, thought this was dumb. Meanwhile i spent my 10k into a drain.. We would DD and research stocks. We found stocks like PLTR ($20), RKLB($4), NU($4-6), (I was huge on quantum when it was pennys), NVDA ($40 then), (RDDT), and many more. Example of photo linked My friend would slowly buy shares, not really caring about bears, and or holding through them. He quickly 2x his portfolio within a year. At the time I was working on programming some stock analysis tools, and other projects like algo trading systems. Which took up an unbelievable amount of time. I thought slightly I could “beat the market”. Basically holding stocks for a couple of weeks/months at most. I’m not sure what my friend has made the past few years, but it was enough to afford an apartment at our college. We were planning to go to the same college, which is a bit more pricy. Tbh after losing everything, i’ve decided to play long. But goddamn do I suck at sticking with my guts. I’ve let so many more opportunities, like gold, robotics, etc, slip away from my portfolio from a panic sell, i don’t blame you for calling OP an awful trader. But it was a lesson needed for me to learn. Sometimes it just feels too late on all of my ideas and stocks i’ve had for year. It’s been just brutal watching my $1-$10 shares explode in value. And seeing a dream you/vision you once had slowly fade away but work with someone else is painful. I know 10k isn’t an extreme amount for some people here, but as a college trying to transfer for my degree now, it’s just rough. My buddy has been planning to be a type of financial advisor, and he’s definitely got a golden portfolios to help! My point with this post is try your best to control your emotions, don’t swipe away your shares from fear. And if you’re new/excited, try opening a small account for a longer term strategy! “\"\\*\\*Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful,\\*\\*\"”- \\*The King, Buffet\\*",

      "selftext_processed": "I burned my graduation money for college and my career . I started trading October of 2023 probably the best time to get in the market before our huge rally ’ s . I was 18 and had the typical “ i can beat the market ” mindset . My friend helped me get into it he only had about a year of experience but was a much safer investor . We both started with 1k although he shortly added almost his entire savings into it around 10k . Me being new thought this was dumb . Meanwhile i spent my 10k into a drain .. We would DD and research stocks . We found stocks like PLTR $ 20 RKLB $ 4 NU $ 46 I was huge on quantum when it was pennys NVDA $ 40 then RDDT and many more . Example of photo linked My friend would slowly buy shares not_really caring about bears and or holding through them . He quickly 2x his portfolio within a year . At the time I was working on programming some stock analysis tools and other projects like algo trading systems . Which took up an unbelievable amount of time . I thought slightly I could “ beat the market ” . Basically holding stocks for a couple of weeksmonths at most . I ’ m not_sure what my friend has made the past few years but it was enough to afford an apartment at our college . We were planning to go to the same college which is a bit more pricy . Tbh after losing everything i ’ ve decided to play long . But goddamn do I suck at sticking with my guts . I ’ ve let so many more opportunities like gold robotics etc slip away from my portfolio from a panic sell i don ’ t blame you for calling OP an awful trader . But it was a lesson needed for me to learn . Sometimes it just feels too late on all of my ideas and stocks i ’ ve had for year . It ’ s been just brutal watching my $ 1 $ 10 shares explode in value . And seeing a dream youvision you once had slowly fade away but work with someone else is painful . I know 10k isn ’ t an extreme amount for some people here but as a college trying to transfer for my degree now it ’ s just rough . My buddy has been planning to be a type of financial advisor and he ’ s definitely got a golden portfolios to help My point with this post is try your best to control your emotions don ’ t swipe away your shares from fear . And if you ’ re newexcited try opening a small account for a longer term strategy “ Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful ” The King Buffet"

      "selftext": "I know the title sounds kind of crazy, but hear me out. Over the past year or so, companies have been using TV and radio to heavily market to the public that GLP-1 is the \"#1 savor\" for weight lost. Now, I'm not against the drug and I believe that it is very useful. The process of losing weight is different for everyone, and this drug is great in that sense. However......like with all good things, people find a way to abuse them! There are SO many smaller companies selling compounds of this drug and people are able to get them without prescriptions. Even on social media (TikTok and others), there are doctors, practicing and non practicing, that are actively/heavily *promoting* some of these compounds and most likely getting some sort of kickback without the liability. Idc about the logistics of it all, I'm just telling you what I see on my social media feeds. In some weird way, I'm getting opioid crisis/Purdue Pharma/Sackler Family vibes. **No**, there are **no direct parallels** necessarily, but things just seem off about this. I think it's probably the easy accessibility and the opportunity for abuse. Also, as we all know with medicine, it usually takes years to hear about major side effects, which is normal. On top of that, I'm sure there are people using it in *creative* ways. Basically, I'm betting for even more significant side effects, lack of adherence and misuse/abuse. This also reminds me of when I learned that Sudafed was limited in the stores/pharmacies in the early 2000s because it could be used to make....you know what. But before that, I'm sure sudafed was a free-for-all type of situation. Now on to the investing part...I'm not too sure how to do this. Doing some quick research, and I was thinking of doing what those hedge funds did to Gamestop a few years ago. I think it's called shorted/shorting? The only difference is that I don't have billions, so I won't lose billions..haha. I'm thinking of it as something on the side, small amounts of money over a period of time. But I think the same principle still applies, right? Obviously, this isn't a short term thing. But I expect companies to take a major hit eventually, and then the government will put some regulation in place in some sort of way. What are your opinions? How should I start? Overall, do you all think i crazy for betting for something like this? Idk...humans always find a way to abuse things, so i don't feel too crazy for this idea.",

      "selftext_processed": "I know the title sounds kind of crazy but hear me out . Over the past year or so companies have been using TV and radio to heavily market to the public that GLP1 is the 1 savor for weight lost . Now Im not_against the drug and I believe that it is very useful . The process of losing weight is different for everyone and this drug is great in that sense . However ...... like with all good things people find a way to abuse them There are SO many smaller companies selling compounds of this drug and people are able to get them without prescriptions . Even on social media TikTok and others there are doctors practicing and non practicing that are activelyheavily promoting some of these compounds and most likely getting some sort of kickback without the liability . Idc about the logistics of it all Im just telling you what I see on my social media feeds . In some weird way Im getting opioid crisisPurdue PharmaSackler Family vibes . No there are no direct parallels necessarily but things just seem off about this . I think its probably the easy accessibility and the opportunity for abuse . Also as we all know with medicine it usually takes years to hear about major side effects which is normal . On top of that Im sure there are people using it in creative ways . Basically Im betting for even more significant side effects lack of adherence and misuseabuse . This also reminds me of when I learned that Sudafed was limited in the storespharmacies in the early 2000s because it could be used to make .... you know what . But before that Im sure sudafed was a freeforall type of situation . Now on to the investing part ... Im not_too sure how to do this . Doing some quick research and I was thinking of doing what those hedge funds did to Gamestop a few years ago . I think its called shortedshorting The only difference is that I dont have billions so I wont lose billions .. haha . Im thinking of it as something on the side small amounts of money over a period of time . But I think the same principle still applies right Obviously this isnt a short term thing . But I expect companies to take a major hit eventually and then the government will put some regulation in place in some sort of way . What are your opinions How should I start Overall do you all think i crazy for betting for something like this Idk ... humans always find a way to abuse things so i dont feel too crazy for this idea ."

      "selftext": "Is anyone else watching BitGo? With Circle (+168%) and Bullish (+143%) recently mooning, I decided to do some digging on this one. The Good (Why it might pump): \\- Insane Growth: H1 2025 Revenue hit $4.19B (nearly 4x YoY). \\- Real Assets: They hold $90B+ in custody (mostly BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, SUI). \\- Big Backers: Goldman and Citi are leading the deal. The Bad (Why I’m worried): Margins are Dead: Despite 4x revenue, net income dropped to $12.6M. Operating costs are eating them alive. Valuation: Expected 4B-5B. Priced for perfection. My IPO strategy: The quick flip. I’m treating this as a short-term flip, not a long-term hold. I’m treating this purely as a short-term arbitrage, not a long-term hold. \\- Enter: At IPO or market open to catch the hype wave. \\- Exit: If it hits +50% on Day 1, I’m selling. \\- Stop Loss: If it breaks issue price, cut it loose. Verdict: Great narrative (First Custody Stock), but the financials are shaky. I plan to profit from the initial volatility, but I won't be holding this long-term. Thoughts?",

Big Backers Goldman and Citi are leading the deal . The Bad Why I ’ m worried Margins are Dead Despite 4x revenue net income dropped to $ 12.6M . Operating costs are eating them alive . Valuation Expected 4B5B . Priced for perfection . My IPO strategy The quick flip . I ’ m treating this as a shortterm flip not_a longterm hold . I ’ m treating this purely as a shortterm arbitrage not_a longterm hold . Enter At IPO or market open to catch the hype wave . Exit If it hits 50 % on Day 1 I ’ m selling . Stop Loss If it breaks issue price cut it loose . Verdict Great narrative First Custody Stock but the financials are shaky . I plan to profit from the initial volatility but I wont be holding this longterm . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "Everyone is worried that the Powell investigation will pose an unprecedented challenge to the Fed's independence, and that a credibility crisis could trigger a systemic downgrade in the United States assets , I wanna say, trading stocks from a macro perspective is no different from throwing darts to pick stocks. This shit didn’t prevent $GOOG from breaking through 4 trillion today. Clearly, we cannot expect a $4-trillion company to grow by another Doble. However, the deepening of NVIDIA's cooperation in AI drug research will definitely enable the stocks with the greatest growth potential and explosive power to more than double in size. Which ONE ? $LLY is indeed the \"king of industrialization\" of AI pharmaceuticals, and has reached a strategic agreement with Nvidia for a joint investment of $1 billion, but there will be no surprises if it is already Prcie in, and I won't go to places with a lot of people. $ILMN is indeed a good alternative, it provides the genomic data needed for AI evolution, and has successfully transformed from a hardware supplier to an AI data service provider, and its business model is transforming to high-profit software and services, but it has doubled from the bottom and is also priced in. So, who will be the next target for capital inflow? I belive $RXRX is the best choice. It is not crowded at present, has stopped falling in the low demand zone, and its share price is also reasonable. Once the rotation reaches $RXRX, there is still a chance to double at least. Recursion is Nvidia's \"core ally\" and a direct equity investment in AI-driven pharmaceutical research. Its Recursion OS is a closed-loop system that integrates vast amounts of proprietary biological imaging data, which represents its core competitive advantage. Recursion is one of the few companies in this sector with a petabyte-scale internal dataset capable of executing AI-driven, closed-loop experiments. Under the leadership of CEO Chris Gibson, $RXRX has strategically focused its efforts on \"translating biology into search problems,\" aligning closely with the logic of Google and Nvidia. Most importantly, $RXRX has a substantial cash reserve that will last through 2027, and it operates BioHive-2, the industry's most advanced AI supercomputer. I am absolutely committed to supporting $RXRX.",

This shit didn ’ t prevent $ GOOG from breaking through 4 trillion today . Clearly we can not expect a $ 4trillion company to grow by another Doble . However the deepening of NVIDIAs cooperation in AI drug research will definitely enable the stocks with the greatest growth potential and explosive power to more than double in size . Which ONE $ LLY is indeed the king of industrialization of AI pharmaceuticals and has reached a strategic agreement with Nvidia for a joint investment of $ 1 billion but there will be no_surprises if it is already Prcie in and I wont go to places with a lot of people . $ ILMN is indeed a good alternative it provides the genomic data needed for AI evolution and has successfully transformed from a hardware supplier to an AI data service provider and its business model is transforming to highprofit software and services but it has doubled from the bottom and is also priced in . So who will be the next target for capital inflow I belive $ RXRX is the best choice . It is not_crowded at present has stopped falling in the low demand zone and its share price is also reasonable . Once the rotation reaches $ RXRX there is still a chance to double at least . Recursion is Nvidias core ally and a direct equity investment in AIdriven pharmaceutical research . Its Recursion OS is a closedloop system that integrates vast amounts of proprietary biological imaging data which represents its core competitive advantage . Recursion is one of the few companies in this sector with a petabytescale internal dataset capable of executing AIdriven closedloop experiments . Under the leadership of CEO Chris Gibson $ RXRX has strategically focused its efforts on translating biology into search problems aligning closely with the logic of Google and Nvidia . Most importantly $ RXRX has a substantial cash reserve that will last through 2027 and it operates BioHive2 the industrys most advanced AI supercomputer . I am absolutely committed to supporting $ RXRX ."

      "title": "What I learned from Tracking My Investment Calls in 2025",
      "selftext": "As a long time investor, I realized this year that I often had tens if not hundreds of strong calls or at least \"hunches\" throughout a year. I also realized that I tended to only strongly remember the biggest winners and the occasional loser that I would tend to \"rationalize\" away. So this year, I decided to record and publish every \"buy\" in my mind throughout the year, along with my thesis and numbers behind the decision (and timestamp the day of the call). In order to systematize the process, I followed a strict set of rules to interpret the results fairly. Winners would be categorized as up more than 5% throughout the period. Neutral picks are within 5% up or down (dead money, or recent calls mainly). Losers were tagged as greater than a 5% loss. All picks (regardless of June or December timestamp) would be equally weighted. An Equal Weight return would be calculated from the aggregate of all performances. **The Results:** I ended up writing 35 \"calls\" between April and December 2025. Price on the day I published vs today. No edits. No pretending I sold the top. No “would’ve sized this differently.” Just the equal weight returns. Over this period the 35 theses returned roughly **42%**. **Winners/Neutral/Losers** * **Up more than 5%:** **18 / 35 (51%)** * **Neutral (±5%):** **5 / 35 (14%)** * **Down more than 5%:** **12 / 35 (34%)** Here are a couple of notes that completely changed how I view my personal investing strategy: Diversification among convicted buys is not optional for stock pickers. Yes, a lot of my highest conviction stocks worked out, but some flat out did not and were anchors to the portfolio. Even if you are \"right\" over the long term, you might lose for years and waste a tremendous amount of opportunity cost, timing matters. Asymmetric setups and winners are everything to market outperformance. One high conviction investment at the right time can buy you market beating performance for several years to come. (even at a 1/35th allocation) **A handful of names did almost all the work.** JMIA (+478%) RKLB (+288%) HOOD (+167%) AMD (+143%) SOFI (+142%). **A handful of names also did the majority of damage to equal weight returns:** HNST (-52%) BMNR (-49%) COIN (-21%) HIMS (-21%) MELI (-17%) PYPL (-16%) **Another important point of discovery:** Going against the common sentiment in a stock, is right a heck of a lot more than it's wrong. My biggest winners as well as convictions came during capitulations this year (AMD selling off under 100 despite massive pipelines and insatiable AI demand), Estee Lauder Stock trading as if it's going to file bankruptcy, the death of Google by chatgpt, so on and so forth. **Lastly,** although not being able \"to sell\" certainly cost me real performance over this experiment, it also helped immensely with discipline. Not panic selling long-term convictions over a headline and inversely not selling the first 15% pop in a long term hold due to frustration also turned small winners into monsters at times. **Yes,** there are undoubtedly times to sell high performers when they surpass long term targets in a hurry, but it's often much later than you think. Overall, it was an awesome exercise and I highly recommend trying it for yourself in 2026. Regardless of the returns or bull market luck, I became an immensely better investor throughout the process. Let me know if you have any questions about the process, results, or in general.",

      "selftext_processed": "As a long time investor I realized this year that I often had tens if not_hundreds of strong calls or at least hunches throughout a year . I also realized that I tended to only strongly remember the biggest winners and the occasional loser that I would tend to rationalize away . So this year I decided to record and publish every buy in my mind throughout the year along with my thesis and numbers behind the decision and timestamp the day of the call . In order to systematize the process I followed a strict set of rules to interpret the results fairly . Winners would be categorized as up more than 5 % throughout the period . Neutral picks are within 5 % up or down dead money or recent calls mainly . Losers were tagged as greater than a 5 % loss . All picks regardless of June or December timestamp would be equally weighted . An Equal Weight return would be calculated from the aggregate of all performances . The Results I ended up writing 35 calls between April and December 2025 . Price on the day I published vs today . No_edits . No_pretending I sold the top . No_ “ would ’ ve sized this differently. ” Just the equal weight returns . Over this period the 35 theses returned roughly 42 % . WinnersNeutralLosers Up more than 5 % 18 35 51 % Neutral ±5 % 5 35 14 % Down more than 5 % 12 35 34 % Here are a couple of notes that completely changed how I view my personal investing strategy Diversification among convicted buys is not_optional for stock pickers . Yes a lot of my highest conviction stocks worked out but some flat out did not_and were anchors to the portfolio . Even if you are right over the long term you might lose for years and waste a tremendous amount of opportunity cost timing matters . Asymmetric setups and winners are everything to market outperformance . One high conviction investment at the right time can buy you market beating performance for several years to come . even at a 135th allocation A handful of names did almost all the work . JMIA 478 % RKLB 288 % HOOD 167 % AMD 143 % SOFI 142 % . A handful of names also did the majority of damage to equal weight returns HNST 52 % BMNR 49 % COIN 21 % HIMS 21 % MELI 17 % PYPL 16 % Another important point of discovery Going against the common sentiment in a stock is right a heck of a lot more than its wrong . My biggest winners as well as convictions came during capitulations this year AMD selling off under 100 despite massive pipelines and insatiable AI demand Estee Lauder Stock trading as if its going to file bankruptcy the death of Google by chatgpt so on and so forth . Lastly although not_being able to sell certainly cost me real performance over this experiment it also helped immensely with discipline . Not_panic selling longterm convictions over a headline and inversely not_selling the first 15 % pop in a long term hold due to frustration also turned small winners into monsters at times . Yes there are undoubtedly times to sell high performers when they surpass long term targets in a hurry but its often much later than you think . Overall it was an awesome exercise and I highly recommend trying it for yourself in 2026 . Regardless of the returns or bull market luck I became an immensely better investor throughout the process . Let me know if you have any questions about the process results or in general ."

I also still have 15k in another previous employers 401k plan at Fidelity that's still with them. It's 51% domestic stock, 38% foreign stock, 10% bonds (roughly). From the portal I have an annualized return of 18.96% with Index of 22.98%. So it's actually 18k+ right now, not 15 as I thought it was last time I checked. I also have a bunch of Ethereum (I already withdrew my initial investment) and it's valued anywhere between 150,000-200,000 based on the numbers of the past month. I'm not banking on it, it's just an extra atm. What should I do with this? I have no kids, single at 37, very little debt (just vehicle) but I'm unemployed by choice but should be able to earn 100k\\~ salary when I get back to work after caretaking for my parents for the past two years of unemployment. I have about 30k+ in savings. I want to be able to live financially independent of any partner. Any and every advice would be appreciated. Thank you. Edit: I do not own my home, I'm back living with parents as I figure out their end of life situation. I expect to get back in the workforce and either purchase a home in the next year or otherwise just move out on my own again after the fact. I'm not counting on any inheritance. Though if I'm able to square my parents a way where they're safe and secure through the rest of their lives, they may be able to help me cosign for a mortgage to help me get a leg up there. Additional Edit: I've now moved them over to Fidelity where I actually already have my last account of 15k so I guess 'lets goooo'. I dunno. Just tryin to survive here while having a good time",

      "selftext": "As I've posted before here, I'm neck deep into RKT shares, from my one and ONLY YOLO from 5+ yrs ago, starting with WAMPQ ->WMIH -> COOP -> RKT last year. I also started getting into Options (both buying AND selling them) last year, after learning from you all (and other Reddit forums), to generate income against those shares (because I don't want to/can't practically sell them all at once). I was (and in some way, still am) a novice when it comes to Options, and needed to learn about DTEs, Delta/Theta etc, by trial and ERROR. I also needed to understand TAX implications of suddenly coming into so much $$$ all at once. On Taxes: Did you know that there's something called a \"Millionaire Tax\" surcharge in MA? And that there's a 4% NIIT (Net Investment Income) Tax at the Federal Level at $200k (single)/$300k or more in \"investment\" income? I also had to LEARN (the HARD way) \\*when\\* to sell Covered Calls & PUTS, when NOT to, when to take Profits early on CCs and PUTS, when you need to just BTC (Buy To Close) a losing Options Trade. For example, today's losses came from getting \"caught\" in an overnight 10% run-up in RKT last week, after Trump tweeted TWICE about Housing, where I should have closed the CCs after the 1st Tweet (and then dropped the $200B MBS bombshell afterhours). I knew RKT would get to this range, but I assumed it would get to today's level after Feb/Earnings. Then the tweets happened..... Half of today's \"Loss\" is from Rolling a couple of CC's up/out, so the loss wasn't that bad comparatively to what it was looking like it might be over the weekend (like 2-3x WORSE, before the Powell news tanked things a bit this morning). Most of RKT's potential is already priced in given the run-up, for now, but I do expect it to be into the high $20's next year, which is still a very nice gain if you bought it in the $10's range, last year. Any questions, happy to discuss.",

I also started getting into Options both buying AND selling them last year after learning from you all and other Reddit forums to generate income against those shares because I dont want tocant practically sell them all at once . I was and in some way still am a novice when it comes to Options and needed to learn about DTEs DeltaTheta etc by trial and ERROR . I also needed to understand TAX implications of suddenly coming into so much $ $ $ all at once . On Taxes Did you know that theres something called a Millionaire Tax surcharge in MA And that theres a 4 % NIIT Net Investment Income Tax at the Federal Level at $ 200k single $ 300k or more in investment income I also had to LEARN the HARD way when to sell Covered Calls PUTS when NOT_to when to take Profits early on CCs and PUTS when you need to just BTC Buy To Close a losing Options Trade . For example todays losses came from getting caught in an overnight 10 % runup in RKT last week after Trump tweeted TWICE about Housing where I should have closed the CCs after the 1st Tweet and then dropped the $ 200B MBS bombshell afterhours . I knew RKT would get to this range but I assumed it would get to todays level after FebEarnings . Then the tweets happened ..... Half of todays Loss is from Rolling a couple of CCs upout so the loss wasnt that bad comparatively to what it was looking like it might be over the weekend like 23x WORSE before the Powell news tanked things a bit this morning . Most of RKTs potential is already priced in given the runup for now but I do expect it to be into the high $ 20s next year which is still a very nice gain if you bought it in the $ 10s range last year . Any questions happy to discuss ."

One thing constantly mentioned is that they are less tax efficient due to the extra need for rebalancing vs a weighted ETF. I think I'm missing something because my lizard brain tells me that there should inherently be less rebalancing that needs to be done with equal weight since a holding only needs to adjusted if it is removed from the underlying index (in this case S&P 100). Whereas a weighted ETF would also need to remove this same holding entirely if it's removed from the index, plus it also needs to adjust weights periodically to match market caps even when a holding isn't removed from the underlying index.

The major Gold producers of the era saw dramatic gains during the worst years of the economic collapse (1929–1933): * **Homestake Mining (USA):** The largest U.S. gold producer saw its stock price rise **474%** from 1929 to January 1933. By early 1936, shares were up **580%** from the 1929 market top. * **Dome Mines (Canada):** The largest Canadian producer's shares rose **558%** during the same 1929–1933 period. * **Dividends:** Unlike most companies that cut or eliminated payouts, major gold miners substantially increased dividends. Homestake's dividend rose from $7 to $15 per share, and Dome Mines' climbed from $1 to $1.80.",

      "selftext": "Source - [ Growing public backlash against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is creating a new category of investment risk that goes beyond traditional ESG concerns. Companies with ICE exposure are now facing what analysts are calling a \"volatility factor\" - where reputational damage, employee dissent, and local legal resistance can materially impact valuations regardless of federal funding levels. Private prison operators GEO Group (GEO) and CoreCivic (CXW) carry the highest concentration risk, with GEO deriving roughly 40%+ of revenue from ICE-related operations. Despite benefiting from post-election enforcement expansion, both stocks have turned volatile as legal resistance intensifies in states like California and New Jersey, and municipalities increasingly use zoning laws to block new detention facilities. Big tech names including Palantir (PLTR) and Amazon (AMZN) face a different threat: internal resistance. Palantir has weathered repeated employee protests over its immigration software contracts, while Amazon's AWS infrastructure supporting DHS operations makes it a frequent target for boycott campaigns despite the revenue being financially immaterial. Perhaps most surprising is the hospitality sector's exposure. Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) face what the report calls \"brand contagion risk\" - where franchise-level decisions can quickly escalate into nationwide boycotts. Hilton is currently navigating pressure from both sides after a Minnesota Hampton Inn refused service to ICE personnel, triggering political backlash while still remaining exposed to activist scrutiny elsewhere. This feels like a new paradigm where federal contracts don't automatically mean safe revenue anymore.",

      "selftext": "Mods took down my last post after 200k views. No idea why. Wasn't selling anything, wasn't pumping tickers, just sharing my thinking. Whatever. Trying again with more focus on the macro and less on specific positions since apparently that's a problem. **What I think is happening:** * Trump needs the market to rip into midterms. That's it. That's the whole thing. Everything else flows from there. * Tax cuts, deregulation, defense spending, rate cuts, cash handouts to the base. He needs wins he can point to, and stock market go up is the easiest win there is. * Meanwhile nobody wants to test him right now. Maduro got snatched. That sent a message. Iran's not going to do anything crazy. Putin's going to wait and see. China's playing nice for the moment. * That buys a window where risk assets can run. **Then last night happened:** * DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell. The stated reason is testimony about some building renovation at the Fed. The actual reason, according to Powell himself, is that Trump wants lower rates. * Powell posted a video Sunday night. Direct quote: \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\" * He said that. On camera. The Fed Chair publicly accused the President of using the DOJ to intimidate him into cutting rates. * Gold hit record highs overnight. Dollar sold off. Futures dumped. \"Sell America\" trade came back. * But by midday stocks had mostly recovered. Same pattern as Liberation Day tariffs. Selloff, panic, stabilization, back to business. **What this means:** * Short term: volatility. Markets don't like Fed independence being threatened. Chop ahead. * Medium term: probably bullish? If Trump gets his rate cuts, whether by breaking Powell or replacing him in May, that's rocket fuel for stocks. Bad for the dollar, bad for inflation eventually, but good for equities through 2026. * Long term: this is where it splits into two very different futures. **Path one, the pump:** * Trump gets what he wants. Rates come down. Housing unfreezes. Consumer spending picks up. * Defense budget passes. $1.5T proposed. Counter-drone, AI infrastructure, domestic manufacturing all eat. * Deregulation everywhere. Crypto rips. Tech rips. Everything rips. * Market pumps into midterms. People with risk assets do well. **Path two, the collapse:** * Trump doesn't stop at pressuring the Fed. He breaks it. Foreign investors lose faith in US institutions. * \"Sell America\" stops being a one day trade and becomes a trend. Bonds, dollar, and stocks all falling together. * Or he goes further. Starts taking territory, seizing assets from other countries, because the spending isn't sustainable otherwise. World wants to respond but can't, at first, because US military dominance. * Internal resistance builds. Coup, paralysis, who knows. Or we stumble into a real conflict. China moves on Taiwan. Russia escalates. Iran miscalculates. * Everything falls apart. **Here's the thing though:** * Even in path two, some stuff still works. Defense doesn't go down during wars. AI infrastructure still matters. Critical minerals become more critical, not less. * Unless it goes nuclear. Then none of this matters and we all have bigger problems than our portfolios. **Signals I'm watching:** * Fed independence. If Powell gets indicted or pushed out early, major red flag. Multiple \"Sell America\" days in a row means it's real. * Defense budget. $1.5T passes, defense names keep working. Stalls or gets blocked, time to reassess. * Supreme Court on Lisa Cook. Arguments this month on whether Trump can fire Fed governors. He wins, Fed independence is done. * Credit card cap. Trump floated 10% today. Banks cratered. If this happens, he's willing to break things for short term juice. * Foreign treasury holders. China and Japan start dumping in size, that's the real signal. * Gold. Already at records. Keeps ripping while stocks chop, smart money is positioning for something. **When I get out:** * Fed independence breaks and market prices it in over days, not hours * Defense budgets stall * Bonds, dollar, stocks all falling together for a week plus * Actual military conflict, not just talk **Where I'm positioned:** * Themes: defense, AI infrastructure, critical minerals, domestic semis, some housing * Mix of shares and longer dated options * Stuff that wins if Trump pumps, but doesn't completely die if things get ugly **Bottom line:** * Bull case: market pumps into midterms, I take profits in 2026 * Bear case: system breaks, but defense and infrastructure still work because wars need supplies * Worst case: nukes, and nobody cares about stonks anymore I'm comfortable with those odds.",

      "selftext_processed": "Mods took down my last post after 200k views . No_idea why . Wasnt selling anything wasnt pumping tickers just sharing my thinking . Whatever . Trying again with more focus on the macro and less on specific positions since apparently thats a problem . What I think is happening Trump needs the market to rip into midterms . Thats it . Thats the whole thing . Everything else flows from there . Tax cuts deregulation defense spending rate cuts cash handouts to the base . He needs wins he can point to and stock market go up is the easiest win there is . Meanwhile nobody_wants to test him right now . Maduro got snatched . That sent a message . Irans not_going to do anything crazy . Putins going to wait and see . Chinas playing nice for the moment . That buys a window where risk assets can run . Then last night happened DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell . The stated reason is testimony about some building renovation at the Fed . The actual reason according to Powell himself is that Trump wants lower rates . Powell posted a video Sunday night . Direct quote The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president . He said that . On camera . The Fed Chair publicly accused the President of using the DOJ to intimidate him into cutting rates . Gold hit record highs overnight . Dollar sold off . Futures dumped . Sell America trade came back . But by midday stocks had mostly recovered . Same pattern as Liberation Day tariffs . Selloff panic stabilization back to business . What this means Short term volatility . Markets dont like Fed independence being threatened . Chop ahead . Medium term probably bullish If Trump gets his rate cuts whether by breaking Powell or replacing him in May thats rocket fuel for stocks . Bad for the dollar bad for inflation eventually but good for equities through 2026 . Long term this is where it splits into two very different futures . Path one the pump Trump gets what he wants . Rates come down . Housing unfreezes . Consumer spending picks up . Defense budget passes . $ 1.5T proposed . Counterdrone AI infrastructure domestic manufacturing all eat . Deregulation everywhere . Crypto rips . Tech rips . Everything rips . Market pumps into midterms . People with risk assets do well . Path two the collapse Trump doesnt stop at pressuring the Fed . He breaks it . Foreign investors lose faith in US institutions . Sell America stops being a one day trade and becomes a trend . Bonds dollar and stocks all falling together . Or he goes further . Starts taking territory seizing assets from other countries because the spending isnt sustainable otherwise . World wants to respond but cant at first because US military dominance . Internal resistance builds . Coup paralysis who knows . Or we stumble into a real conflict . China moves on Taiwan . Russia escalates . Iran miscalculates . Everything falls apart . Heres the thing though Even in path two some stuff still works . Defense doesnt go down during wars . AI infrastructure still matters . Critical minerals become more critical not_less . Unless it goes nuclear . Then none of this matters and we all have bigger problems than our portfolios . Signals Im watching Fed independence . If Powell gets indicted or pushed out early major red flag . Multiple Sell America days in a row means its real . Defense budget . $ 1.5T passes defense names keep working . Stalls or gets blocked time to reassess . Supreme Court on Lisa Cook . Arguments this month on whether Trump can fire Fed governors . He wins Fed independence is done . Credit card cap . Trump floated 10 % today . Banks cratered . If this happens hes willing to break things for short term juice . Foreign treasury holders . China and Japan start dumping in size thats the real signal . Gold . Already at records . Keeps ripping while stocks chop smart money is positioning for something . When I get out Fed independence breaks and market prices it in over days not_hours Defense budgets stall Bonds dollar stocks all falling together for a week plus Actual military conflict not_just talk Where Im positioned Themes defense AI infrastructure critical minerals domestic semis some housing Mix of shares and longer dated options Stuff that wins if Trump pumps but doesnt completely die if things get ugly Bottom line Bull case market pumps into midterms I take profits in 2026 Bear case system breaks but defense and infrastructure still work because wars need supplies Worst case nukes and nobody_cares about stonks anymore Im comfortable with those odds ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been digging into Dateline Resources lately, and man, I’m seriously bullish on this one. Ticker is DTR on the ASX, or DTREF over the counter. It’s a gold and rare earths play out in California, right next to that big MP Materials operation, which gives it some real strategic edge in the US market. Their recent drilling at the Colosseum project has been killer, hitting these wide gold intercepts like 295 meters at over a gram per ton from surface. Stuff like that extends way beyond their current resource, and they’re talking about updating the mineral estimate soon. Plus, they’ve got board appointments with some heavy hitters in mining, which tells me the team’s leveling up for bigger things. Price-wise, it’s been on a tear. Shot up from pennies last year to around 32 cents now, with an 18 percent jump just today on solid volume. Yeah, there might be some pullbacks, but gold prices are through the roof, and with AI and tech booming, demand for rare earths is only going higher. They’re eyeing a bankable feasibility study in the first quarter, and if those rare earth targets pan out, this could be massive. I’m loading up because I see huge upside here, especially with the push for domestic critical minerals. No rush to sell, though, I’m in for the long haul with patience. The location, the results, and the market trends all line up. What do you all think? Anyone else holding?",

      "selftext": "Hello all, I was hoping you could help me figure out how to rebalance my portfolio. I'm ~40yo, make around $180/yr in a HCOL area. I'm currently very aggressive in total market index fund allocation. It's my belief that there will be a shift away from the US in the coming years to decades. Whether due to normal economics, political turmoil, dedollarization, end of reserve currency status, purposeful defaulting on national debt to undermine markets. To me it seems like somebody in my position should be better positioned so that the potential losses are hedged in some manner. Here's a brief summary of my accounts. some of the data is obfuscated but you can get the point. Accounts are over multiple lines and all of the rows of that similar name are the accounts holdings. | Account Name | Symbol | Description | Quantity | Current Value (rounded) | Percent Of Account | |---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:| | Main Brokerage | SPAXX\\*\\* | HELD IN MONEY MARKET | | ~$32,800 | 9.19% | | Main Brokerage | VTI | VANGUARD INDEX FDS VANGUARD TOTAL STK MKT ETF | 601.722 | ~$203,900 | 57.11% | | Main Brokerage | VXUS | VANGUARD TOTAL INTERNATIONAL STOCK INDEX FUND | 129.317 | ~$10,000 | 2.80% | | Main Brokerage | BND | VANGUARD BD INDEX FDS TOTAL BND MRKT | 166.292 | ~$12,300 | 3.46% | | Main Brokerage | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 518.761 | ~$98,000 | 27.44% | | Rollover IRA | CORE\\*\\* | FDIC-INSURED DEPOSIT SWEEP | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | Rollover IRA | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 2311.105 | ~$436,400 | 100.00% | | Post-Tax ROTH IRA | CORE\\*\\* | FDIC-INSURED DEPOSIT SWEEP | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | Post-Tax ROTH IRA | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 520 | ~$98,200 | 100.00% | | IRA MOM | SPAXX\\*\\* | HELD IN MONEY MARKET | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | IRA MOM | FPIFX | FIDELITY FREEDOM INDEX 2020 INVESTOR | 926.689 | ~$15,800 | 59.71% | | IRA MOM | FFFAX | FIDELITY FREEDOM RETIREMENT FUND | 937.059 | ~$10,600 | 40.29% | | 401K | FXAIX | FID 500 INDEX | 690.839 | ~$165,600 | 100.00% | | HYSA | | | | ~$100,000 | 100.00% | I was thinking that in tax advantaged accounts it would be good to move to VXUS or FTIHX. Both total international funds. My goal is to have international exposure. But I also don't want to lose out on growth. Maybe in the Roth IRA have a fund that is more aggressive like Contrafund or Blue chip or tech select. any advice would be great and appreciated. I just don't want to make a mistake and you I know are smarter than I. Thank you",

Im currently very aggressive in total market index fund allocation . Its my belief that there will be a shift away from the US in the coming years to decades . Whether due to normal economics political turmoil dedollarization end of reserve currency status purposeful defaulting on national debt to undermine markets . To me it seems like somebody in my position should be better positioned so that the potential losses are hedged in some manner .

      "selftext": "When AI heats up, low-priced names often move first because traders pile into what is liquid and headline-sensitive. This is the short list I watch under $6. My 5 AI tickers to watch: **- BBAI** **- REKR** **- RIME** **- NOTE** **- GCT** Why I keep them: RIME stays on because it has a specific applied AI angle in freight logistics and has disclosed real run-rate metrics. The company reported SemiCab ARR up 220% from $2.5M to over $8M during 2025 and cited $15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts and expansions (source type: company press release). That is the kind of disclosure that can keep attention after the first spike. NOTE stays on because it is a simple way to play \"AI SaaS\" sentiment without needing it to be in logistics. When software and AI sentiment improves, names like this can move on category flows. REKR stays on because it is a transportation AI play. It is not pure freight optimization, but it is connected to the same idea: AI applied to real-world mobility systems, which can catch a sector bid. Do you think the best rotation trades come from broad AI baskets like NOTE and BBAI, or from niche applied AI stories like RIME that can drop contract and ARR updates? Do your own homework.",

The company reported SemiCab ARR up 220 % from $ 2.5M to over $ 8M during 2025 and cited $ 15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts and expansions source type company press release . That is the kind of disclosure that can keep attention after the first spike . NOTE stays on because it is a simple way to play AI SaaS sentiment without needing it to be in logistics . When software and AI sentiment improves names like this can move on category flows . REKR stays on because it is a transportation AI play . It is not_pure freight optimization but it is connected to the same idea AI applied to realworld mobility systems which can catch a sector bid . Do you think the best rotation trades come from broad AI baskets like NOTE and BBAI or from niche applied AI stories like RIME that can drop contract and ARR updates Do your own homework ."

      "selftext": "Last night Jerome Powell said the DOJ subpoenas into the Fed came alongside pressure from the Trump administration to push rate cuts. He made it clear the Fed won’t bend policy decisions to political pressure. Markets reacted quickly. Futures dipped, the dollar softened, and gold caught a bid, not because policy changed but because confidence in Fed independence matters a lot for equities. This hits stocks in a subtle way. A Fed that looks pressured adds uncertainty around rates, inflation control, and long-term valuations. That’s not great for risk assets that have been pricing a smooth path into 2026. Feels less like short-term drama and more like something investors need to keep on the radar when positioning for the year ahead. Feels like positioning now at these prices is a bit more risk, at least for short term gains.",

      "selftext": "Source - The dollar and Wall Street futures dropped and gold jumped on Monday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the Trump administration had threatened him with a criminal indictment over the refurbishment of the central bank's headquarters. This escalated worries about the Fed's independence from political influence to a new level and added to a frenetic start to 2026, which has already seen the U.S. capture Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro and ramp up talk of taking control of Greenland. Gold hit a record high of $4,600 on Monday, while silver also set a new peak, as a criminal probe by the Trump administration into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent investors back into the asset viewed as a safe haven. Spot gold jumped 1.7% to $4,584.12 per ounce by 1159 GMT, after earlier hitting a record high of $4,600.33. U.S. gold futures for February delivery gained 2.1% to $4,595.",

      "selftext": "The past few weeks we have seen how Trump has gone further and further into authorianism, removing all shackles of oversight & limits to his power. So far the market hasn't cared, not for inciting civil war, not for invading other countries, not for wanting to abolish NATO and now for prosecuting Powell simply because he does not do anything he is asked to. Now my question is: if markets don't care nor react to this either, will that not just prove to Trump that he is right and he can go even further? A (massive) correction right now would prove that the chosen path isn't accepted, but right now the market is cheering for it. What do you guys think?",

So far the market hasnt cared not_for inciting civil war not_for invading other countries not_for wanting to abolish NATO and now for prosecuting Powell simply because he does not_do anything he is asked to . Now my question is if markets dont care nor react to this either will that not_just prove to Trump that he is right and he can go even further A massive correction right now would prove that the chosen path isnt accepted but right now the market is cheering for it .

      "selftext": "I’m 20 from Australia, qualified in a physically demanding trade. I work early mornings, long days. I earn around $1,800 a week after tax including overtime, and in the next few weeks my hourly rate goes from $47 to $55 an hour. I’m posting this because I want honest feedback, not validation. Where am I being naive? Where am I overthinking it? Where would you push harder or pull back if you were me? My general philosophy with money is this: build slowly, test myself honestly, and earn the right to press harder later. I’m playing the long game, but I want leverage if I actually prove worthy of it. I’m ambitious and not satisfied with “average good outcomes”. I want more, but not recklessly. I’m very aware that consistency beats intensity, and that most people fail because they scale too early, not too late. So this is how I currently run things. I operate off a fixed weekly allocation system I built with the help of AI, based on about 90% of my income so there’s always buffer. Weekly it looks like this: $400 for core living expenses, $160 for lifestyle, $300 towards a house deposit, $100 for travel or bigger purchases, and $600 into investing. Total is $1,560 a week. Anything extra covers weekly variance or goes into trading. Every category has its own savings account. All spending goes on a credit card for points and gets paid off in full every Sunday. No rolling balances, no bullshit. Lifestyle is intentionally tight. Probably tighter than most people my age would tolerate, but I work a physical job and I’m not exactly living it up mid-week anyway. I’ve built in room for excess because I know this isn’t sustainable forever. When income grows and life changes, I plan to let myself breathe more. I also keep an $8k emergency fund that I don’t touch, and I’ve got about $7k sitting in VONG from earlier on which I’m no longer adding to. For investing, I put $600 a week into US ETFs. Roughly 40% into VGT, 40% into VTI, and 20% into VXUS. This is meant to compound quietly in the background and act as a financial backbone. I don’t touch it emotionally. No tinkering, no panic moves, no chasing whatever’s hot this month. Alongside that, I run a small swing trading account, about $2k. This is not income to me. It’s training. I treat trading as skill development, pattern recognition, and learning capital preservation before there’s ever any talk of real leverage. I trade end-of-day swings since I’m in Australia trading US markets. I focus on sector strength, tight consolidations, breakouts and pullbacks, defined risk, and high ADR stocks. Capital only increases after demonstrated consistency. If I ever scale it, the money would come from slowly reallocating ETFs, not lifestyle or savings. I’m not relying on trading to save me. I’m practicing so it could become leverage later if I earn it. Medium term, the next 3–5 years, the goals are straightforward. Keep building a house deposit, buy a property when it actually makes sense, keep ETF compounding going, stay disciplined with trading, and increase income through higher paying roles, specialisation, or side businesses. I already proportionally feel the physical tax of my job I don’t want my income ceiling to rely on my body forever. I know plans look clean on paper and real life doesn’t care. Fatigue, boredom, temptation, and bad decisions are real. So I’ll ask again, honestly: where am I getting this wrong? Where am I playing it too safe? If you were 20, working a physical job, and thinking long term, what would you change? Am I underutilising my income, or am I actually protecting my future properly? Give me your worst. You old bastards.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m 20 from Australia qualified in a physically demanding trade . I work early mornings long days . I earn around $ 1800 a week after tax including overtime and in the next few weeks my hourly rate goes from $ 47 to $ 55 an hour . I ’ m posting this because I want honest feedback not_validation . Where am I being naive Where am I overthinking it Where would you push harder or pull back if you were me My general philosophy with money is this build slowly test myself honestly and earn the right to press harder later . I ’ m playing the long game but I want leverage if I actually prove worthy of it . I ’ m ambitious and not_satisfied with “ average good outcomes ” . I want more but not_recklessly . I ’ m very aware that consistency beats intensity and that most people fail because they scale too early not_too late . So this is how I currently run things . I operate off a fixed weekly allocation system I built with the help of AI based on about 90 % of my income so there ’ s always buffer . Weekly it looks like this $ 400 for core living expenses $ 160 for lifestyle $ 300 towards a house deposit $ 100 for travel or bigger purchases and $ 600 into investing . Total is $ 1560 a week . Anything extra covers weekly variance or goes into trading . Every category has its own savings account . All spending goes on a credit card for points and gets paid off in full every Sunday . No_rolling balances no_bullshit . Lifestyle is intentionally tight . Probably tighter than most people my age would tolerate but I work a physical job and I ’ m not_exactly living it up midweek anyway . I ’ ve built in room for excess because I know this isn ’ t sustainable forever . When income grows and life changes I plan to let myself breathe more . I also keep an $ 8k emergency fund that I don ’ t touch and I ’ ve got about $ 7k sitting in VONG from earlier on which I ’ m no_longer adding to . For investing I put $ 600 a week into US ETFs . Roughly 40 % into VGT 40 % into VTI and 20 % into VXUS . This is meant to compound quietly in the background and act as a financial backbone . I don ’ t touch it emotionally . No_tinkering no_panic moves no_chasing whatever ’ s hot this month . Alongside that I run a small swing trading account about $ 2k . This is not_income to me . It ’ s training . I treat trading as skill development pattern recognition and learning capital preservation before there ’ s ever any talk of real leverage . I trade endofday swings since I ’ m in Australia trading US markets . I focus on sector strength tight consolidations breakouts and pullbacks defined risk and high ADR stocks . Capital only increases after demonstrated consistency . If I ever scale it the money would come from slowly reallocating ETFs not_lifestyle or savings . I ’ m not_relying on trading to save me . I ’ m practicing so it could become leverage later if I earn it . Medium term the next 3–5 years the goals are straightforward . Keep building a house deposit buy a property when it actually makes sense keep ETF compounding going stay disciplined with trading and increase income through higher paying roles specialisation or side businesses . I already proportionally feel the physical tax of my job I don ’ t want my income ceiling to rely on my body forever . I know plans look clean on paper and real life doesn ’ t care . Fatigue boredom temptation and bad decisions are real . So I ’ ll ask again honestly where am I getting this wrong Where am I playing it too safe If you were 20 working a physical job and thinking long term what would you change Am I underutilising my income or am I actually protecting my future properly Give me your worst . You old bastards ."

      "selftext": "[ The Chinese government has said it will review Manus’ deal with Meta announced on December 29 to assess whether it complies with the country’s export controls and technology transfer policies. Manus was founded by Chinese engineers and backed by Chinese investors, the company moved its headquarters to Singapore in June last year. Its product became unavailable in China in July. Around the same time, Manus reportedly laid off its Chinese staff and closed its offices in the country. “Manus left China to pursue international market opportunities just before they materialized,” Lian Jye Su, a Singapore-based tech analyst who monitors AI startups in the region at Omdia, told *Rest of World*. “Its exodus has left the impression that Chinese tech startups can only get international attention if they operate outside of China.” Because of the US-China rivalry, which is causing this strict scrutiny of the deal has, what does it mean for the Chinese startups? Right now, they have the option to either operate within China or give up China to operate internationally. Should this be a concern for China i.e the risk of loosing their talent? Should Chines govt. or investors provide Chinese startups the capital they need so that the Chinese startups do not have to look at Western/ US investments?",

I found out that Victoria secrets (VSCO) drops mid summer and tops out around Christmas at around a 140% gain. Home Depot(HD) falls to its lowest around Christmas and gets to its peak right around mid summer (moderate gains of 20-30%). So I have started a pattern of buying VSCO in the summer, selling in the winter, purchasing HD with the small amount of funds I have, then selling HD in the summer and buying VSCO immediately after the funds have settled. Simply put, any advice on how to do this better?",

I found out that Victoria secrets VSCO drops mid summer and tops out around Christmas at around a 140 % gain . Home DepotHD falls to its lowest around Christmas and gets to its peak right around mid summer moderate gains of 2030 % . So I have started a pattern of buying VSCO in the summer selling in the winter purchasing HD with the small amount of funds I have then selling HD in the summer and buying VSCO immediately after the funds have settled . Simply put any advice on how to do this better"

      "selftext": "**I don't know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to re-post anyway.** Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here. I think Figma is no longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $20B. It’s definitely grown bigger (in terms of ARR + suite of AI offerings) and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI. What O365 is for productivity, Figma is for creativity. By creativity, I don’t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as, but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company. In my opinion, they have moved past Adobe, Sketch, and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor, Lovable, and other AI coding platforms. My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely single-player and code-first with no enterprise lock-in moat. This was further solidified when I saw Google invested. Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lock-ups expiring. Here are my supporting theses: 1. **Figma beat Adobe XD, Sketch, and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design, not because it packed more designer features.** * Browser native * Real-time collaboration * Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative. This is Figma’s premise, and this is why Cursor, Lovable, and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments. 2. **Adobe offered $20B to acquire Figma in 2022, before AI coding platforms became cool.** At that time: * ARR was rougely \\~$400M * Figma was just a design collab tool * AI wasn’t core to the product story yet Fast forward: * ARR now \\~$1B+ * Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting. And what led me to frame this POV. 3. **Enterprise Lock-in.** This may be the most under-appreciated part. The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include (“must know Figma”) along with process and governance changes which are hard to break. Switching becomes organizationally painful. This enterprise lock-in is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms. Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack, in the end. But this time, with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multi-player strength that other platforms won’t be able to compete with. Not to mention the amount of legal, security, and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise. Figma is already there. 4. **Complete AI Co-Creation Suite.** While most companies slap AI on top, Figma does something far more intentional. It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation (**Figjam**), design & prototyping (**Design**), build (**Make**), and deployment (**Site**) of apps with AI, all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process. One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year. This will help them accelerate a \"design to CMS-powered website\" workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and WP. If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard. It is really not. What’s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete, cohesive, and easy-to-use. How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform? 5. **The role of the designer and developer are converging.** One way to look at it is, the pool of seats (i.e. TAM) became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design. This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors, not the fastest created but looks cookie-cutter. 6. **A potential acquisition target to big tech giants.** Now this is highly speculative but: * What if google wanted a true end-to-end product creation stack * What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office * What if Amazon wanted a creative + dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise, creation, collaboration, AI, and design systems. That scarcity matters. The potential for big acquisition is not far-fetched. **Personal position:** I’ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around \\~$34 and believes this will have a big move, once investors catch on to the true potential. Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game, and I'm invested for the long-term.",

      "selftext_processed": "I dont know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to repost anyway . Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here . I think Figma is no_longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $ 20B . It ’ s definitely grown bigger in terms of ARR suite of AI offerings and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI . What O365 is for productivity Figma is for creativity . By creativity I don ’ t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company . In my opinion they have moved past Adobe Sketch and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor Lovable and other AI coding platforms . My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely singleplayer and codefirst with no_enterprise lockin moat . This was further solidified when I saw Google invested . Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lockups expiring . Here are my supporting theses 1 . Figma beat Adobe XD Sketch and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design not_because it packed more designer features . Browser native Realtime collaboration Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative . This is Figma ’ s premise and this is why Cursor Lovable and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments . 2 . Adobe offered $ 20B to acquire Figma in 2022 before AI coding platforms became cool . At that time ARR was rougely $ 400M Figma was just a design collab tool AI wasn ’ t core to the product story yet Fast forward ARR now $ 1B Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting . And what led me to frame this POV . 3 . Enterprise Lockin . This may be the most underappreciated part . The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include “ must know Figma ” along with process and governance changes which are hard to break . Switching becomes organizationally painful . This enterprise lockin is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms . Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack in the end . But this time with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multiplayer strength that other platforms won ’ t be able to compete with . Not_to mention the amount of legal security and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise . Figma is already there . 4 . Complete AI CoCreation Suite . While most companies slap AI on top Figma does something far more intentional . It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation Figjam design prototyping Design build Make and deployment Site of apps with AI all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process . One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year . This will help them accelerate a design to CMSpowered website workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix Squarespace and WP . If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard . It is really not_What ’ s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete cohesive and easytouse . How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform 5 . The role of the designer and developer are converging . One way to look at it is the pool of seats i.e . TAM became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design . This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors not_the fastest created but looks cookiecutter . 6 . A potential acquisition target to big tech giants . Now this is highly speculative but What if google wanted a true endtoend product creation stack What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office What if Amazon wanted a creative dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise creation collaboration AI and design systems . That scarcity matters . The potential for big acquisition is not_farfetched . Personal position I ’ ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around $ 34 and believes this will have a big move once investors catch on to the true potential . Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game and Im invested for the longterm ."

Is a basket of basically Mag7 stocks - with some data center and defense additions - a solid portfolio for next 5-10 years or is concentration risk too much? (also got another 100-120k coming to deploy in a few months) Here are my 3 scenarios: 1 - MAG7 stocks with highest weight in AMZN, with some extra picks - TSM, SHLD, VRT, PWR, RYCEY, ABBNY (yea all at highs) 2 - Keep large base in VOO(60-70%?) - add high confiction singles - AMZM, NVDA, TSM, VRT, SHLD 3 - just 100% VOO and dont pick winners My brain is telling me 1 is too high on concentration risk but on the other hand the market is basically just the mag 7 right now anyway. any thoughts appreciated",

      "selftext": "If you bother or care to look up my post history I posted on thetagang about this strat already, but posting here this time to keep a log of sorts which I’ll update my positions on. (Don’t expect any big numbers, I have a small account < 10K) The inverse iron condor strat: So a regular iron condor is simple enough. An otm call credit spread and otm put credit spread for an initial credit, defined risk/reward, long theta, short Vega, delta neutral at start. The DTE is your choice, but I hear short dated is better because less uncertainty, which makes sense (you want the price to stay between your short strikes, and thus let the entire spread expire worthless). The other well-known strat is a reverse or long iron condor, which is an otm debit put and call spread, and this time it’s short theta, long Vega, delta neutral at start. This one you want the price to move drastically up or down. With me so far? Congrats, you just got a short explanation on standard and reverse iron condors from yours truly. So, what’s different with the inverse iron condor? Simple, my problem was this: I hate entering a trade for a debit. And my thesis? Markets don’t stay the same in a longer period of time. Solution: open a fully itm credit call/put spread for a net CREDIT, short theta, LONG Vega, delta neutral at start, and we want price to move drastically now. Give yourself a bit of time for market to move (95DTE approx), and bob’s your uncle. But, you tell me, you’re really dumb. You could’ve just opened a credit condor using all calls or all puts for the same P/L outlook. Aren’t you even thinking about early assignment? Why yes, dear reader. You are absolutely correct. Because of early assignment risk, I have decided this strategy is best for SPX which is European-style. As for the condor, I forgor 💀 (really, that’s the only reason. Do a regular credit condor if you want I’m not your mom). So to sum up, buy fully ITM call and put spreads same expiry, same strike widths apart. Market dumps, you win. Market rallies, you win! Market flatlines, you lose. If any one of you says this was done with chatGPT’s help, I will find you and stuff rocks up your butt hole. For now here’s a screenshot of my SPY position that used the same strat, which I plan on exiting ASAP because I don’t want to mess around with early assignment risk.",

Don ’ t expect any big numbers I have a small account 10K The inverse iron condor strat So a regular iron condor is simple enough . An otm call credit spread and otm put credit spread for an initial credit defined riskreward long theta short Vega delta neutral at start . The DTE is your choice but I hear short dated is better because less uncertainty which makes sense you want the price to stay between your short strikes and thus let the entire spread expire worthless . The other wellknown strat is a reverse or long iron condor which is an otm debit put and call spread and this time it ’ s short theta long Vega delta neutral at start . This one you want the price to move drastically up or down . With me so far Congrats you just got a short explanation on standard and reverse iron condors from yours truly . So what ’ s different with the inverse iron condor Simple my problem was this I hate entering a trade for a debit . And my thesis Markets don ’ t stay the same in a longer period of time . Solution open a fully itm credit callput spread for a net CREDIT short theta LONG Vega delta neutral at start and we want price to move drastically now . Give yourself a bit of time for market to move 95DTE approx and bob ’ s your uncle . But you tell me you ’ re really dumb . You could ’ ve just opened a credit condor using all calls or all puts for the same PL outlook . Aren ’ t you even thinking about early assignment Why yes dear reader . You are absolutely correct . Because of early assignment risk I have decided this strategy is best for SPX which is Europeanstyle . As for the condor I forgor 💀 really that ’ s the only reason . Do a regular credit condor if you want I ’ m not_your mom . So to sum up buy fully ITM call and put spreads same expiry same strike widths apart . Market dumps you win . Market rallies you win Market flatlines you lose . If any one of you says this was done with chatGPT ’ s help I will find you and stuff rocks up your butt hole . For now here ’ s a screenshot of my SPY position that used the same strat which I plan on exiting ASAP because I don ’ t want to mess around with early assignment risk ."

We’ve already lifted to $23, but I’m not even thinking about selling. The \"MBS God-Candle\" just ignited. Trump just ordered a $200B mortgage bond buy, pushing 30-year rates under 6% overnight. The Trump administration is perfectly aligned with $RKT because housing affordability is a top agenda item. Institutional giants and advocates like Bill Pulte and Bill Ackman are already vocal about crushing these spreads to force affordability. The real alpha for 2026 is Rocket’s transformation into a tech-driven financial powerhouse. By integrating the Redfin search funnel and Mr. Cooper servicing book, they now own the entire Search-to-Close lifecycle. As the market realizes Rocket scales like a SaaS company rather than a cyclical bank, I'm expecting massive multiple expansion. I like the stock even more than before. I still like rockets.

      "selftext": "My two cents on Petco. Petco’s equity is priced for bankruptcy, while its cash flow, liquidity, and credit markets price it as a surviving, self-funding business, creating massive upside if operations merely stabilize. The company is trading at \\~5.5x EBITDA and a \\~11-13% FCF yield on normalized numbers. The balance sheet, while levered, is structured with a long runway (2028) and flexible covenants. The operational pivot under Joel Anderson is already beginning to show in the form of margin expansion and cash generation. Just a point I want to make, most screeners show Petco trading at EV/EBITDA of \\~11x, whilst showing the EV as \\~$3.55 billion. I think this is incorrect as the EV includes the operating leases capitalised on the balance sheet. The cost of these leases have already hit the P&L through either COGS or SG&A. EBITDA is the earnings attributable to equity and debt holders. The amounts paid to lessors has already been accounted for in the EBITDA metric. If we want to include operating leases as part of EV, the we should use the EBITDAR metric. Alternatively, we can just strip out the operating leases. The market views Petco as a structurally impaired discretionary retailer facing a liquidity event. This framing is wrong. Petco is primarily a recurring consumables and services business with positive and growing FCF, a covenant lite capital structure, no meaningful debt maturities until 2028, credit markets signalling survival, not distress. The equity market is extrapolating past capital misallocation and near term revenue declines into a solvency crisis that the numbers do not support. For equity to be impaired, three conditions must occur simultaneously: 1. Material EBITDA collapse 2. Inability to service interest 3. Lender ability to force action None are present today as EBITDA grew 21% YoY in Q3 2025 despite declining revenue, interest is covered \\~3x, the \\~$1.6 billion Term Loan is covenant-lite and matures in 2028, the ABL is undrawn with substantial excess availability. Petco is now self-funding and does not rely on capital markets to operate. This is not a growth story. Equity upside requires only EBITDA stabilization, continued FCF generation, gradual deleveraging toward \\~3x net leverage. Under this base case, bankruptcy risk collapses, short interest (\\~20%) unwinds and the stock rerates from \\~5.5x to \\~7x EV/EBITDA. This implies \\~50–70% upside without heroic assumptions. Even in a stressed scenario (continued revenue decline, margin pressure, tariffs), interest remains covered, FCF remains positive, and liquidity runway extends beyond 24 months. Downside is owning a slow growth, cash generative retailer, not a zero. The market is pricing a liquidity event that the math does not support. If the company simply stabilizes, the equity is materially undervalued. Happy to answer any questions and get information from other investors who have looked at this.",

      "selftext_processed": "My two cents on Petco . Petco ’ s equity is priced for bankruptcy while its cash flow liquidity and credit markets price it as a surviving selffunding business creating massive upside if operations merely stabilize . The company is trading at 5.5x EBITDA and a 1113 % FCF yield on normalized numbers . The balance sheet while levered is structured with a long runway 2028 and flexible covenants . The operational pivot under Joel Anderson is already beginning to show in the form of margin expansion and cash generation . Just a point I want to make most screeners show Petco trading at EVEBITDA of 11x whilst showing the EV as $ 3.55 billion . I think this is incorrect as the EV includes the operating leases capitalised on the balance sheet . The cost of these leases have already hit the PL through either COGS or SGA . EBITDA is the earnings attributable to equity and debt holders . The amounts paid to lessors has already been accounted for in the EBITDA metric . If we want to include operating leases as part of EV the we should use the EBITDAR metric . Alternatively we can just strip out the operating leases . The market views Petco as a structurally impaired discretionary retailer facing a liquidity event . This framing is wrong . Petco is primarily a recurring consumables and services business with positive and growing FCF a covenant lite capital structure no_meaningful debt maturities until 2028 credit markets signalling survival not_distress . The equity market is extrapolating past capital misallocation and near term revenue declines into a solvency crisis that the numbers do not_support . For equity to be impaired three conditions must occur simultaneously 1 . Material EBITDA collapse 2 . Inability to service interest 3 . Lender ability to force action None are present today as EBITDA grew 21 % YoY in Q3 2025 despite declining revenue interest is covered 3x the $ 1.6 billion Term Loan is covenantlite and matures in 2028 the ABL is undrawn with substantial excess availability . Petco is now selffunding and does not_rely on capital markets to operate . This is not_a growth story . Equity upside requires only EBITDA stabilization continued FCF generation gradual deleveraging toward 3x net leverage . Under this base case bankruptcy risk collapses short interest 20 % unwinds and the stock rerates from 5.5x to 7x EVEBITDA . This implies 50–70 % upside without heroic assumptions . Even in a stressed scenario continued revenue decline margin pressure tariffs interest remains covered FCF remains positive and liquidity runway extends beyond 24 months . Downside is owning a slow growth cash generative retailer not_a zero . The market is pricing a liquidity event that the math does not_support . If the company simply stabilizes the equity is materially undervalued . Happy to answer any questions and get information from other investors who have looked at this ."

But everything online tells me GGLL is meant for day trading? I understand what they mean, but if I really think google will be more successful - wouldn’t it make sense to have 2x leveraged shares ?",

I am extremely bullish on google and I want to hold the stock long term and I see that GGLL offers 2x leveraged shares that grow more when the company grows . But everything online tells me GGLL is meant for day trading I understand what they mean but if I really think google will be more successful wouldn ’ t it make sense to have 2x leveraged shares"

      "selftext": "How many people are honestly still investing in stocks *just* to study fundamentals Because, honestly, I’m starting to doubt it. What’s the point of investing in the first place? Isn’t it to maximize returns? Isn’t it to beat inflation? I trade more on the short-term side, and yeah, it’s been working for me. But the moment I mention I’ve owned Tesla or ASTS, someone always jumps in like Bro, that’s just speculation Okay. So what if it is? People love to talk about value. Like unless you’re talking earnings reports, P/E ratios, or DCF models, it somehow doesn’t count as real value. But to me, value is pretty simple Can this stock make me money *within a level of risk I’m comfortable with*? If a stock makes me money, improves my life, and moves me closer to the future I want, then yeah that’s a good stock *to me* Value isn’t something written in textbooks. It’s not just numbers in a spreadsheet. It shows up in your account balance. And as for the word gambler I see it thrown around on Reddit all the time. You’re a gambler You’ll blow up eventually You don’t understand investing Fine. I’ll say it. In a way, I *am* a gambler.But I’m not gambling on a quick jackpot. I’m gambling on being a better father. On my kids getting a better education. On them having the freedom to do what they actually want in life. On them carrying less debt and less financial pressure.I’m gambling on the future. And I’m gambling with responsibility. So what about you?You’re gambling too. You’re gambling that the system always works. That markets stay rational. That the theories you learned never break.If your so called “value investing” keeps you stuck, while my “speculation” keeps pushing me closer to my goals, then who’s really closer to the point of investing?And if that makes me a gambler then fuck it. I’m a gambler what the hell are you？？？？？？？？",

      "selftext": "I'm young and naïve enough to think that this time's parabolic rise in silver is different from the short-lived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers. Michael Lynch's work has shown that bullion banks, contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes, have bought into strength this time around, as opposed to 'selling at the highs' in silver contracts: [ I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, in which many banks initially caught off-sides on credit default swaps, then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis, before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape. That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price, after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side. For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market, I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbell's Substack, which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater: [ **Why Pan American Silver $PAAS?** [Handsome Silver Miners]( Because Rick Rule likes the stock, this is the primary reason. Who is this guy Rick? I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds; it doesn't really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks, as long as it works. [Pan American Founder and real-life Indiana Jones global explorer]( The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong, high cash flow enterprise, $PAAS holds three massive non-producing silver mega-projects across LATAM: Navidad, Escobal and La Colorada Skarn. While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver, they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the company's books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory & community based opposition, as a result their incredible value is not appropriately reflected in Pan American's valuation. However recent American big-stick resource 'diplomacy' across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions. This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela, as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia, Greenland and Mexico. Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from high-performance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure, as well as silver's critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes, I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production. In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term, Pan American's three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations. Escobal was a fully functioning, monster silver mine in decades past, mothballed only due to non-technical, social/legal considerations. La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing, world-class silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent. Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive, newly rationalized Argentinian government. If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon, which I believe should've been yesterday, Pan American Silver's trio of mega-projects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy. **Disclosure and positions**: I've been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls.

      "selftext_processed": "Im young and naïve enough to think that this times parabolic rise in silver is different from the shortlived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers . Michael Lynchs work has shown that bullion banks contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes have bought into strength this time around as opposed to selling at the highs in silver contracts I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis in which many banks initially caught offsides on credit default swaps then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape . That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side . For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbells Substack which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater Why Pan American Silver $ PAAS Handsome Silver Miners Because Rick Rule likes the stock this is the primary reason . Who is this guy Rick I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds it doesnt really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks as long as it works . Pan American Founder and reallife Indiana Jones global explorer The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong high cash flow enterprise $ PAAS holds three massive nonproducing silver megaprojects across LATAM Navidad Escobal and La Colorada Skarn . While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the companys books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory community based opposition as a result their incredible value is not_appropriately reflected in Pan Americans valuation . However recent American bigstick resource diplomacy across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions . This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia Greenland and Mexico . Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from highperformance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure as well as silvers critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production . In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term Pan Americans three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations . Escobal was a fully functioning monster silver mine in decades past mothballed only due to nontechnical sociallegal considerations . La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing worldclass silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent . Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive newly rationalized Argentinian government . If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon which I believe shouldve been yesterday Pan American Silvers trio of megaprojects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy . Disclosure and positions Ive been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls . Take my opinions with a boulder of salt as I am not_a financial professional in any capacity ."

When you “buy” a stock on the app, Robinhood purchases the stock and holds it for your account but it really belongs to robinhood. What is the general consensus of Robinhood as a trading platform? Would it be worth transferring my portfolio? Additionally, are there any other secure, FDIC insured platforms that are generally liked?",

      "title": "Looking for portfolio feedback- GGUS/UGL/Senior AUD bank bonds",
      "selftext": "I'd like to ask for some feedback regarding the thesis behind this long-term strategy as an Australian investor (40% GGUS/30% UGL/20% AUD cash/senior bank bonds, 10% aussie miners/personal stock picks) with 20% bands, yearly rebalancing), where it could go wrong, and for constructive critique. The basic premise is that over the next 7-10 years, the USD is expected to depreciate relative to the AUD (mean-reversion), and a number of other considerations, like higher US inflation to be expected. This is for a number of reasons, mainly due to geopolitical risk as countries move away from US treasuries and into gold, but also due to the stated and expected policy of the US government that they want the dollar to be lower. In addition, I do not see a politically feasible way for the US in the medium term to rebalance the debt-to-GDP ratio without higher levels of inflation than normal. US spending seems relatively fixed in terms of Medicare/Social Security, and is only expected to increase over the coming decades due to a demographic squeeze, so only inflation or higher taxation are viable long-term solutions (unless the US gets rid of the above). Given the political paralysis, higher taxation is unlikely, and very unlikely for the next 3 years while Trump is in office (besides tariffs, which do not meaningfully compensate for tax cuts). GGUS is 80-100% overall AUD currency-hedged S&P500 exposure, UGL is 60%ish USD-denominated gold exposure, and the 20% cash/Australian senior bank bonds are used for rebalancing when there is a crash. There are a few possible bad scenarios I have considered, and how this portfolio would play out. \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **1. War/Significant geopolitical event** GGUS will likely crash, UGL will likely rocket as a safe asset in times of global chaos. Enables rebalancing. I expect this will be more likely in the medium term as the effects of climate change and productive capacity in the Global South decrease (climate refugees etc.). **2. Persistent US inflation** Since I'm hedged with the AUD in GGUS this is not a major concern for me, and since economically companies price based on inflation, I'm economically long higher levels of inflation and lower interest rates (expected in the near term). Gold is also useful for this. **3. Stock market crash (bubble popping)** This would likely be due to higher interest rates reducing discount rates or a bubble popping. In the near term, stocks will fall. Gold may be mixed effects, there for rebalancing. Cash also there for rebalancing. Appears there's a long-term mean reversion between stocks and gold but generally these are uncorrelated assets which is why this is useful. **4. Deflation** I don't believe that this is likely in the macroeconomic environment we are in- central banks would be likely to decrease interest rates. However, under this scenario, the portfolio does lose considerable value. **5. Tariff death spiral** Stocks will crash, gold will likely soar as it's not dependent on government policy. Rebalance, buy the dip, TACO. **6. Bond vigilantes** This is possible in the next 5-10 years if inflation is too high and long-term bond investors are not happy with a dovish Fed's low interest rates. Cash/short-term senior Australian bank bonds allow for rebalancing, and I'm happy to hold. Gold/cash allows for rebalancing into the significantly depressed GGUS. **7. The big 4 Australian banks default on senior bank bonds** I think this is very unlikely and would probably mean I have bigger problems to worry about than my portfolio. Similar level of risk to the Australian government defaulting, slightly higher, but an additional risk I'm willing to take for the slightly higher yield on cash. **8. Gold prices decrease** This is possible- gold seems to have short upswings and long periods where it does nothing, likely because of saturation from miners. Given volatility decay losses associated with UGL, I may experience more losses as a result, but for me it's worth the insurance policy. In the long term, it's an uncorrelated asset which will appreciate in value as mining grades will decrease, and will be a useful store of value which eventually appreciates to match inflation or better than inflation. So I'm fine with this risk. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Are there any future likely scenarios I haven't considered? I've also backtested this portfolio and it seems to have done pretty well in the past (\\~14-15%/annum) with okay drawdowns, not a predictor of future returns, but still. Ideally, I still would've preferred a 2x or 3x VT LETF instead for the 40% portion (for broad international diversification and lower daily volatility eating into volatility decay), but that doesn't really exist in a liquid form. Perhaps the only semi-likely scenario I've thought of is that the US govt gets its shit together, but that's unlikely. **TL;DR:** I'm a young early-20's Australian investor looking to FIRE eventually. I'm stress testing a 40% GGUS/30% UGL/20% senior Australian bank bonds (QPON)/10% fun money portfolio (with 20% bands and yearly rebalancing) and would like some feedback/thoughts on where it could go wrong in the long term. The simplest idea is that gold and stocks are uncorrelated assets and allow for yearly rebalancing for tax purposes, and the USD will have to inflate more than normal in the longer term due to political reasons (see US debt-to-GDP), enabling higher returns in currency-hedged leveraged S&P500 and gold. If anyone does find a suitable 2.5x or 3x VT LETF I'd be very happy to switch to that instead for the 40% portion.",

      "selftext_processed": "Id like to ask for some feedback regarding the thesis behind this longterm strategy as an Australian investor 40 % GGUS30 % UGL20 % AUD cashsenior bank bonds 10 % aussie minerspersonal stock picks with 20 % bands yearly rebalancing where it could go wrong and for constructive critique . The basic premise is that over the next 710 years the USD is expected to depreciate relative to the AUD meanreversion and a number of other considerations like higher US inflation to be expected . This is for a number of reasons mainly due to geopolitical risk as countries move away from US treasuries and into gold but also due to the stated and expected policy of the US government that they want the dollar to be lower . In addition I do not_see a politically feasible way for the US in the medium term to rebalance the debttoGDP ratio without higher levels of inflation than normal . US spending seems relatively fixed in terms of MedicareSocial Security and is only expected to increase over the coming decades due to a demographic squeeze so only inflation or higher taxation are viable longterm solutions unless the US gets rid of the above . Given the political paralysis higher taxation is unlikely and very unlikely for the next 3 years while Trump is in office besides tariffs which do not_meaningfully compensate for tax cuts . GGUS is 80100 % overall AUD currencyhedged SP500 exposure UGL is 60 % ish USDdenominated gold exposure and the 20 % cashAustralian senior bank bonds are used for rebalancing when there is a crash . There are a few possible bad scenarios I have considered and how this portfolio would play out . 1 . WarSignificant geopolitical event GGUS will likely crash UGL will likely rocket as a safe asset in times of global chaos . Enables rebalancing . I expect this will be more likely in the medium term as the effects of climate change and productive capacity in the Global South decrease climate refugees etc .. 2 . Persistent US inflation Since Im hedged with the AUD in GGUS this is not_a major concern for me and since economically companies price based on inflation Im economically long higher levels of inflation and lower interest rates expected in the near term . Gold is also useful for this . 3 . Stock market crash bubble popping This would likely be due to higher interest rates reducing discount rates or a bubble popping . In the near term stocks will fall . Gold may be mixed effects there for rebalancing . Cash also there for rebalancing . Appears theres a longterm mean reversion between stocks and gold but generally these are uncorrelated assets which is why this is useful . 4 . Deflation I dont believe that this is likely in the macroeconomic environment we are in central banks would be likely to decrease interest rates . However under this scenario the portfolio does lose considerable value . 5 . Tariff death spiral Stocks will crash gold will likely soar as its not_dependent on government policy . Rebalance buy the dip TACO . 6 . Bond vigilantes This is possible in the next 510 years if inflation is too high and longterm bond investors are not_happy with a dovish Feds low interest rates . Cashshortterm senior Australian bank bonds allow for rebalancing and Im happy to hold . Goldcash allows for rebalancing into the significantly depressed GGUS . 7 . The big 4 Australian banks default on senior bank bonds I think this is very unlikely and would probably mean I have bigger problems to worry about than my portfolio . Similar level of risk to the Australian government defaulting slightly higher but an additional risk Im willing to take for the slightly higher yield on cash . 8 . Gold prices decrease This is possible gold seems to have short upswings and long periods where it does nothing_likely because of saturation from miners . Given volatility decay losses associated with UGL I may experience more losses as a result but for me its worth the insurance policy . In the long term its an uncorrelated asset which will appreciate in value as mining grades will decrease and will be a useful store of value which eventually appreciates to match inflation or better than inflation . So Im fine with this risk . Are there any future likely scenarios I havent considered Ive also backtested this portfolio and it seems to have done pretty well in the past 1415 % annum with okay drawdowns not_a predictor of future returns but still . Ideally I still wouldve preferred a 2x or 3x VT LETF instead for the 40 % portion for broad international diversification and lower daily volatility eating into volatility decay but that doesnt really exist in a liquid form . Perhaps the only semilikely scenario Ive thought of is that the US govt gets its shit together but thats unlikely . TLDR Im a young early20s Australian investor looking to FIRE eventually . Im stress testing a 40 % GGUS30 % UGL20 % senior Australian bank bonds QPON10 % fun money portfolio with 20 % bands and yearly rebalancing and would like some feedbackthoughts on where it could go wrong in the long term . The simplest idea is that gold and stocks are uncorrelated assets and allow for yearly rebalancing for tax purposes and the USD will have to inflate more than normal in the longer term due to political reasons see US debttoGDP enabling higher returns in currencyhedged leveraged SP500 and gold . If anyone does find a suitable 2.5x or 3x VT LETF Id be very happy to switch to that instead for the 40 % portion ."

      "selftext": "RFK has released his idea of what the food pyramid should look like, and honestly disregarding my thoughts on how i feel about it i think there's a big play here in 3 stocks that honestly have risen quite a bit over the past few weeks but I dont think the momentum is even here yet. These stocks are Cava Chipotle Sweet greens Cava, down over like 70% from its ath but seems to have broken out of its down trend.. Sweet greens is even more crazy ipo was at 60 dollars 3 years ago and its at near its all time low at 8 dollars but was 5 dollars a few weeks ago. 1 billion market cap Cmg has been on the market longest but is the most stable price action and down a third from its highs. Was down a half a month ago. Imo Cava and sg probably double from here I know Sweet greens the founder is still with the company and Cava is too i think and tbey are trying to grow their company and sweet greens dude has said they were implementing AI.. so its a good sign I think? And idk i think people are still going more and more outdoors now I dont have any position as I just got stoned and am browsing reddit but honestly now that that I see rfks rendition of a pyramid which has meat and vegetables at the top and whole grains at tbe bottom but the greens and meat are equals weight it seems well that screams Cava to me but like im in canada and have never even visited a Cava or sg store haha but idk i might open a position in cava or sg on a red day But feel free if you like this set up and. Eed to do more DD to go to chatgpt or Germaine and ask it what company is most likely to succeed over a 5 year time frame based on profitability and future market strategy and maybe like what are companies plans to expand both in the u.s. and globally Also plz comment on why this is a good investment or bad investment esp if food quality has gone down recently cause I haven't even been to a Chipotle in a min to see if they're still packed like they used to be but maybe Chipotle sounds good tomorrow but I dont have a single one near me",

These stocks are Cava Chipotle Sweet greens Cava down over like 70 % from its ath but seems to have broken out of its down trend .. Sweet greens is even more crazy ipo was at 60 dollars 3 years ago and its at near its all time low at 8 dollars but was 5 dollars a few weeks ago . 1 billion market cap Cmg has been on the market longest but is the most stable price action and down a third from its highs . Was down a half a month ago . Imo Cava and sg probably double from here I know Sweet greens the founder is still with the company and Cava is too i think and tbey are trying to grow their company and sweet greens dude has said they were implementing AI .. so its a good sign I think And idk i think people are still going more and more outdoors now I dont have any position as I just got stoned and am browsing reddit but honestly now that that I see rfks rendition of a pyramid which has meat and vegetables at the top and whole grains at tbe bottom but the greens and meat are equals weight it seems well that screams Cava to me but like im in canada and have never_even visited a Cava or sg store haha but idk i might open a position in cava or sg on a red day But feel free if you like this set up and . Eed to do more DD to go to chatgpt or Germaine and ask it what company is most likely to succeed over a 5 year time frame based on profitability and future market strategy and maybe like what are companies plans to expand both in the u.s. and globally Also plz comment on why this is a good investment or bad investment esp if food quality has gone down recently cause I havent even been to a Chipotle in a min to see if theyre still packed like they used to be but maybe Chipotle sounds good tomorrow but I dont have a single one near me"

They had a recent 5-1 stock split in December and are in the process of acquiring the cybersecurity company Armis. Common fear is that software will slowly die out from AI and that they can only continue to grow through acquisitions. I don’t really agree with that. They’ve continued to grow around 20% for the last decade. Earnings are on 1/28. Could be a good time to start a position. What are all of your thoughts?",

Common fear is that software will slowly die out from AI and that they can only continue to grow through acquisitions . I don ’ t really agree with that . They ’ ve continued to grow around 20 % for the last decade . Earnings are on 128 . Could be a good time to start a position . What are all of your thoughts"

      "title": "My Clients Buying Silver: A Criticism",
      "selftext": "I’ll summarize my diatribe by saying- the moment you hear of people that simply cannot afford to invest buying a particular asset and doing so in a large number, it’s time to reconsider your exposure. 2018, I made silver recommendations as part of the portfolio‘s hedge against inflation. I got push back - “what inflation?”. my rebuttal was and has always been that we don’t invest solely based on what’s experienced but what we can reasonably conclude. inflation would show up somewhere just as surely as the sun rises. rates were near zero, and I think a good lot of the crowd in here felt the same. right around the time silver crossed the $40 range, I saw a spiked and sudden interest in buying/investing in silver. it seemed to be all the rage. many of my clients had the disposable cash to hold a position. For them, it was fine. but for the rest of the bunch, the conversation forced me to ask for a thesis and a goal. To what end will you invest in silver? where are you hoping to see it? why suddenly now? Mind you, our monetary policy and debt expansion is not anywhere near the free-and-easy regime we saw between ‘18 and ‘21. But the lay person rarely makes those comparative inferences on their own. They watch what others do, see the price run up, catch a few buzzword laden videos on YouTube and it’s ‘all systems go’. My post here is an invitation to consider the demographics of people buying silver because their weak investment philosophy ends up being reflective in the price. could silver move to $100/oz? surely. could also reach $1,000. my ask of anyone is to see that there is some symmetry in how probabilities present themselves. if theres a case for $100, then there’s also a case for $50. the question is what would it mean to you if your certainty is certainly wrong? what would that loss do to your time horizon? the new concept of stomaching loss is to extend the holding period and wait things out. this is also costly. opportunity cost should be part of your pricing analysis and investment thesis. Having said all that, I love silver. It was the largest piece of the pie for me at one time. But God forbid you begin to do financially better and your income improves with wisdom: your headwind becomes taxation and reinventing a scenario where silver makes sense in your portfolio. Taxes on silver gains, unlike cap gains on stocks, are inescapable. The reason that may matter more for some is because of the amount of relative exposure. How much of your wealth extracted from your portfolio do you want to be a check made payable to the IRS? and does 28% sound like a fun haircut to get? Beware of the layperson taking the charge of a bull run. Understand it takes 4 corners to make a room. 3 if you’re weird. Point being, it takes more angles to house a decision.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ll summarize my diatribe by saying the moment you hear of people that simply can not afford to invest buying a particular asset and doing so in a large number it ’ s time to reconsider your exposure . 2018 I made silver recommendations as part of the portfolio ‘ s hedge against inflation . I got push back “ what inflation ” . my rebuttal was and has always been that we don ’ t invest solely based on what ’ s experienced but what we can reasonably conclude . inflation would show up somewhere just as surely as the sun rises . rates were near zero and I think a good lot of the crowd in here felt the same . right around the time silver crossed the $ 40 range I saw a spiked and sudden interest in buyinginvesting in silver . it seemed to be all the rage . many of my clients had the disposable cash to hold a position . For them it was fine . but for the rest of the bunch the conversation forced me to ask for a thesis and a goal . To what end will you invest in silver where are you hoping to see it why suddenly now Mind you our monetary policy and debt expansion is not_anywhere near the freeandeasy regime we saw between ‘ 18 and ‘ 21 . But the lay person rarely makes those comparative inferences on their own . They watch what others do see the price run up catch a few buzzword laden videos on YouTube and it ’ s ‘ all systems go ’ . My post here is an invitation to consider the demographics of people buying silver because their weak investment philosophy ends up being reflective in the price . could silver move to $ 100oz surely . could also reach $ 1000 . my ask of anyone is to see that there is some symmetry in how probabilities present themselves . if theres a case for $ 100 then there ’ s also a case for $ 50 . the question is what would it mean to you if your certainty is certainly wrong what would that loss do to your time horizon the new concept of stomaching loss is to extend the holding period and wait things out . this is also costly . opportunity cost should be part of your pricing analysis and investment thesis . Having said all that I love silver . It was the largest piece of the pie for me at one time . But God forbid you begin to do financially better and your income improves with wisdom your headwind becomes taxation and reinventing a scenario where silver makes sense in your portfolio . Taxes on silver gains unlike cap gains on stocks are inescapable . The reason that may matter more for some is because of the amount of relative exposure . How much of your wealth extracted from your portfolio do you want to be a check made payable to the IRS and does 28 % sound like a fun haircut to get Beware of the layperson taking the charge of a bull run . Understand it takes 4 corners to make a room . 3 if you ’ re weird . Point being it takes more angles to house a decision ."

      "title": "Portfolio Review - Sanity Check",
      "selftext": "Hello! 38 year old male here looking for a sanity check from the community before making changes to my portfolio. This is a taxable brokerage account at Fidelity, with a 20+ year horizon, aiming for long-term growth with enough stability to stay invested during downturns. My portfolio grew organically over time and now has significant overlap (multiple S&P 500 funds, total market funds, growth funds, etc.). I’m trying to simplify and be more intentional without materially changing my overall risk profile. (Roth IRA is handled separately.) Below is how my current allocation looks today. As you’ll see, there’s quite a bit of duplication across similar exposures. # Current Portfolio Allocation |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |FXAIX|17.40%| |FDLXX|9.99%| |FSKAX|7.83%| |FZILX|5.95%| |SPY|5.90%| |VTI|5.47%| |VUG|5.44%| |FZROX|4.85%| |SOXX|4.61%| |FSELX|4.40%| |FTBFX|4.03%| |FSMDX|3.47%| |QQQ|3.44%| |FBGRX|3.20%| |VOO|3.05%| |FBALX|2.67%| |FCNTX|2.38%| |FSPTX|1.73%| |FPURX|1.57%| |FSPGX|1.19%| |FNILX|0.77%| |IAUM|0.43%| |FTIHX|0.23%| Option 1: ETF-based target allocation I’m leaning toward ETFs for simplicity, portability (in case I ever move away from Fidelity), and tax efficiency in a taxable account. |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |VTI|25%| |VOO|25%| |VXUS|20%| |BND|10%| |VUG|8%| |SOXX|5%| |VO|5%| |FDLXX|2%| Option 2: Fidelity-native target allocation If I decide to stay fully within Fidelity, this would be the equivalent allocation using Fidelity funds. |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |FSKAX|25%| |FXAIX|25%| |FTIHX|20%| |FTBFX|10%| |FSPGX|8%| |FSELX|5%| |FSMDX|5%| |FDLXX|2%| Looking for feedback on - Does this allocation make sense for 38 / long-term taxable investing? Any obvious redundancies or unnecessary tilts? Would you simplify this further? Thoughts on VTI + VOO together vs a single US equity fund? Not trying to chase returns, mainly want something simple, diversified, and easy to stick with long term. Appreciate any input. Thanks!",

As you ’ ll see there ’ s quite a bit of duplication across similar exposures . Current Portfolio Allocation Ticker % of Account FXAIX17.40 % FDLXX9.99 % FSKAX7.83 % FZILX5.95 % SPY5.90 % VTI5.47 % VUG5.44 % FZROX4.85 % SOXX4.61 % FSELX4.40 % FTBFX4.03 % FSMDX3.47 % QQQ3.44 % FBGRX3.20 % VOO3.05 % FBALX2.67 % FCNTX2.38 % FSPTX1.73 % FPURX1.57 % FSPGX1.19 % FNILX0.77 % IAUM0.43 % FTIHX0.23 % Option 1 ETFbased target allocation I ’ m leaning toward ETFs for simplicity portability in case I ever move away from Fidelity and tax efficiency in a taxable account . Ticker % of Account VTI25 % VOO25 % VXUS20 % BND10 % VUG8 % SOXX5 % VO5 % FDLXX2 % Option 2 Fidelitynative target allocation If I decide to stay fully within Fidelity this would be the equivalent allocation using Fidelity funds . Ticker % of Account FSKAX25 % FXAIX25 % FTIHX20 % FTBFX10 % FSPGX8 % FSELX5 % FSMDX5 % FDLXX2 % Looking for feedback on Does this allocation make sense for 38 longterm taxable investing Any obvious redundancies or unnecessary tilts Would you simplify this further Thoughts on VTI VOO together vs a single US equity fund Not_trying to chase returns mainly want something simple diversified and easy to stick with long term . Appreciate any input . Thanks"

      "selftext": "As a beginning investor I am looking for ways to built wealth for the extremely long term (50 years). I planned to just put money in the s&p500 monthly, but I learned about small cap value + momentum being theoretically more rewarding. This lead me into a rabbit hole of finding academically proven strategies to increase the geometric mean. Based on what I learned I decided on a very disciplined approach that tries to do just that. This post is for people that find it interesting to look at, but any judgement/advice is also welcome of course. My strategy is the following: Average ROI of US SCV ETF + World SCV ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months gets compared to average ROI of US momentum ETF + World momentum ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months. The higher one gets a weight of 70. This is the dynamic factor allocation (relative performance between the factors, cross-factor momentum). The ETF’s are: ZPRV on IBIS 2 (German stock exchange) on IBKR IWMO on BVME.ETF (Italian stock exchange) on IBKR ZPRX on IBIS 2 (German stock exchange) on IBKR IUMO on LSEETF (English stock exchange) on IBKR All 4 accumulating and IE-domicile. Monthly contributions of €750 (at first, might increase when financial situation changes) with cashflow rebalancing to get as close as possible to an allocation of 70/30 or 30/70 between the factors (SCV and momentum). Realistically between 20-40 and 60-80 is fine. Within the factors the allocation should stay close to 50/50, but +-10 difference is fine. Yearly rebalancing on fixed date (my birthday) if necessary. When monthly contributions and total portfolio become significantly high, I will start thinking about adding light leverage and a trend overlay. EDIT: based in Europe.",

      "selftext": "I was working on a memory task in my software work and liked the datasheet of micron's memory as it was very organized and the chip is powerful. The stock was around 80$. So I picked it up. Sold it after some 20% gains. Did it twice or 3 times. However I withdrew around 3 months ago and the last withdrawal was not profitable. I started investing mid 2022 and set a plan for long term but the 20% gains always pushes me to sell and call it a good year following the (10% annual gain is good) rule. However in the crazy AI era, the bubble vs not bubble is not like any other. The conservative investor should not follow the trends. In short AI made my principles fail and it is my problem for sure. However to recover my mentality and my resilience I need to create a new portfolio. It should be away from tech. As I do not believe AI will enhance our day to day activities and if it did the value of stocks already took this future value inside its prices. Especially when I hear all companies are buying eachothers' stocks. The only valid stock for me in tech is Micron. However it is also cyclical driven when the AI data centers building phase ends the RAM prices would not be justified as there is no race anymore. I think of AI like the space race between superpowers. The value of stock is heavily impacted by politics and greed which both always hype the prices however the gains are not equal or at least would not be growing (i.e. the risk is very high vs the reward is max another 20% or 50% but very small probability that I do not care of). I am 30 years old now and earned around 1000$ from a weighted average of 2000$ scattered on 2.5 years. I say that is a good start in general but absolutely not good compared to the AI gains in the last 2.5 years. I did same mistake of Micron with Nvidia too I started when it was 400$ sold it for 600$ then bought 800$ and sold 1000$. I can not stick for a crazy stock for long as I like to grab the gains and then look somewhere else. Yet timing the market long term surely will wipe my gains. So I'll start following the 80% 20% rule, 20 for the trading, 80 for long term investing. What good industries that set for continued growth in next 5-10 years, not financial institutions or consumer like Walmart. I aim for products or services that will improve people lives. I'll then start to look for some innovative companies either in its service/product or its way of doing them in better financial way. This is my first post here and I am really looking forward for people's advice here.",

      "selftext_processed": "I was working on a memory task in my software work and liked the datasheet of microns memory as it was very organized and the chip is powerful . The stock was around 80 $ . So I picked it up . Sold it after some 20 % gains . Did it twice or 3 times . However I withdrew around 3 months ago and the last withdrawal was not_profitable . I started investing mid 2022 and set a plan for long term but the 20 % gains always pushes me to sell and call it a good year following the 10 % annual gain is good rule . However in the crazy AI era the bubble vs not_bubble is not_like any other . The conservative investor should not_follow the trends . In short AI made my principles fail and it is my problem for sure . However to recover my mentality and my resilience I need to create a new portfolio . It should be away from tech . As I do not_believe AI will enhance our day to day activities and if it did the value of stocks already took this future value inside its prices . Especially when I hear all companies are buying eachothers stocks . The only valid stock for me in tech is Micron . However it is also cyclical driven when the AI data centers building phase ends the RAM prices would not_be justified as there is no_race anymore . I think of AI like the space race between superpowers . The value of stock is heavily impacted by politics and greed which both always hype the prices however the gains are not_equal or at least would not_be growing i.e . the risk is very high vs the reward is max another 20 % or 50 % but very small probability that I do not_care of . I am 30 years old now and earned around 1000 $ from a weighted average of 2000 $ scattered on 2.5 years . I say that is a good start in general but absolutely not_good compared to the AI gains in the last 2.5 years . I did same mistake of Micron with Nvidia too I started when it was 400 $ sold it for 600 $ then bought 800 $ and sold 1000 $ . I can not_stick for a crazy stock for long as I like to grab the gains and then look somewhere else . Yet timing the market long term surely will wipe my gains . So Ill start following the 80 % 20 % rule 20 for the trading 80 for long term investing . What good industries that set for continued growth in next 510 years not_financial institutions or consumer like Walmart . I aim for products or services that will improve people lives . Ill then start to look for some innovative companies either in its serviceproduct or its way of doing them in better financial way . This is my first post here and I am really looking forward for peoples advice here ."

      "selftext": "Valens looks like extreme mispricing at $2.5. There was a -$82M inventory burn data error used by algorithms and scanners, likely from ticker collision between $VLN and $VLN Toronto. Because of this, algorithms modeled this company to have <1Y runway after spending $82 Million while in reality they still have $93M cash and $11m in inventory. Retail has found out about the ticker collision yesterday. Yet algorithms have not caught on yet, as they're still modeling negative EV from -$82M burn (this requires manual correction). Everyone is encouraged to fact check everything below from financials posted to -$82M error on Stonegate, Streetwise, and scanners. $VLN is heavily misunderstood due to its $255M market cap size. This is not due to company quality and it's definitely not some random micro stock. But an artificial suppression from algorithmic pricing in <1Y runway from $82m burn. This is a extremely mispriced AI & Robotics fabless chipmaker with: \\- Mercedes \\- Samsung \\- Mobileye (EyeQ6) \\- Siemens \\- Logitch and many other leading OEMs and Robotics companies as customers. $VLN has \\- Zero Debt. \\- $93.5 Million Cash \\- $11 Million + in inventory. \\- \\~$80M+ est. forward revenue \\- 69.1% gross margins on their robotics/machine vision/industrial vertical (growing 40% Y/Y). Blended margins from their automotive segment brings it down to 63.0%. If you want to compare similar companies: \\- Lattice $LSCC trades around 19x and 23x EV/Revenue. \\- Macom $MTSI, trades around 13x and 16.5x. EV/Revenue. Valens trades at: 2.4x. Which looks like a glitch. Even non-premium, 20-30% gross margin, companies trade at 4-5x (more than double current prices). We now see an extreme mispricing of a $NVDA-margin fabless chipmaker in verticals for machine vision in robotics to AI automotive sectors. Even trading at a normal 10x EV/revenue (no premium) would be $893.5M/106.34M= \\-> $8.40 from $2.5. This seems like an algorithmic mispricing of a decade from NYSE and Toronto ticker collision.",

      "selftext": "Over the past couple of years, I started learning about investment and securities. Before then, I saw everything related to this space as a black box that I would never be able to understand. However, the deeper I go, the more angry and disillusioned I feel. What started as “invest in a company you believe in and grow with it” has turned into a system obsessed with extracting every possible dollar from price movement, no matter the method, no matter the ethics. It’s no longer about funding innovation or helping businesses grow, it’s about speed, leverage, arbitrage, and squeezing edge out of anything that moves. Entire careers now exist just to profit from volatility itself. Not from creating value. Not from improving products. Just from being faster, more aggressive, more optimised than the next guy. And it’s not just traditional markets. Look at crypto. In theory it was meant to democratise finance. In practice it’s become a playground for: - Rug pulls - Pump-and-dumps - Influencer scams - Projects designed from day one to siphon liquidity and disappear So many people now enter markets not to build, but to extract. The goal isn’t “grow something useful.” It’s “how do I get mine before everyone else does?” What bothers me most isn’t that some people are greedy, that’s human. It’s that the system rewards greed so efficiently that moral restraint becomes a disadvantage. If you hesitate, someone else front-runs you. If you care, someone else exploits the gap. At some point, it stops feeling like an engine of progress and starts feeling like an arms race of optimisation divorced from any social purpose. I know markets are necessary. Capital has to flow. Risk has to be priced. But it feels like we’ve built a hyper-financialised layer on top of reality whose only product is more money for those already inside it. And it leaves you wondering: Is this really what “investing” is supposed to be?",

      "selftext_processed": "Over the past couple of years I started learning about investment and securities . Before then I saw everything related to this space as a black box that I would never_be able to understand . However the deeper I go the more angry and disillusioned I feel . What started as “ invest in a company you believe in and grow with it ” has turned into a system obsessed with extracting every possible dollar from price movement no_matter the method no_matter the ethics . It ’ s no_longer about funding innovation or helping businesses grow it ’ s about speed leverage arbitrage and squeezing edge out of anything that moves . Entire careers now exist just to profit from volatility itself . Not_from creating value . Not_from improving products . Just from being faster more aggressive more optimised than the next guy . And it ’ s not_just traditional markets . Look at crypto . In theory it was meant to democratise finance . In practice it ’ s become a playground for Rug pulls Pumpanddumps Influencer scams Projects designed from day one to siphon liquidity and disappear So many people now enter markets not_to build but to extract . The goal isn ’ t “ grow something useful. ” It ’ s “ how do I get mine before everyone else does ” What bothers me most isn ’ t that some people are greedy that ’ s human . It ’ s that the system rewards greed so efficiently that moral restraint becomes a disadvantage . If you hesitate someone else frontruns you . If you care someone else exploits the gap . At some point it stops feeling like an engine of progress and starts feeling like an arms race of optimisation divorced from any social purpose . I know markets are necessary . Capital has to flow . Risk has to be priced . But it feels like we ’ ve built a hyperfinancialised layer on top of reality whose only product is more money for those already inside it . And it leaves you wondering Is this really what “ investing ” is supposed to be"

I don't know why I keep shooting myself in the dick but fuck it, its only a loss when I sell or something pithy like that right? To make it even better, I'm trading this on Etoro itself. I mean I like the platform, why wouldn't I like the stock? Its just like robinhood right (turns out no) AND I am whats called on there a \"popular investor\" which basically means all the noobs who \"know they should invest in something but don't know how to start\" can just \"copy\" me, and they execute all the same trades as me. I have hundreds of people who copy my trades, so I have no idea how much money I have lost people. One of my copiers was clearly a family investing their joint money, they closed their copy down 25% in total after copying me for like 6 months. So while all of you can claim to be dipshits, I'm the dipshit losing both mine AND strangers money.",

I already got rejected from the research track and I’m waiting until April for the applied track results, but I’m worried I’m \"too old\" at 30 compared to the 20-year-olds with no experience they seem to prefer. The opportunity cost is killing me I originally planned to buy gold, and I’m still salty after losing 70% (due to currency devaluation) of my EGP savings in 2021 waiting on a Canadian visa. Watching inexperienced kids get accepted over me is frustrating, but I’m hoping my stock portfolio is diversified enough to cover the €15k (around 18k USD, so 30% of my holdings at current prices) if I finally get the green light.",

Currently I have all my money in VOO and cash in IBKR around 60k USD in total Im moving it to either SPYL or VUAA I also want to diversify Im worried about how heavy nvidia is about USA current geopolitical actions also I dont really like how heavy financial sector is in all ETFs . this is what Im thinking I MIGHT need some parts of it in a few months if not_Im moving them to SPYL.L because I dont see USA falling anytime soon with their navy and them being the largest consumer of the world so if something happens to them it will happen to all of the world . Also currently no_income but in the future Id probably do at least 50 % SP500 then rest is depends on how the market is could be more sp500 . Weight Ticker Name of Fund Accumulating Expense Ratio Domicile 50 % SPYL.L SPDR SP 500 UCITS ETF Yes 0.03 % USD Ireland 15 % IXUA.DE iShares MSCI World exUSA UCITS ETF Yes 0.15 % EUR Ireland 15 % EIMI.L iShares Core MSCI EM IMI UCITS ETF Yes 0.18 % USD Ireland 10 % IGLN.L iShares Physical Gold ETC Yes Physical 0.12 % USD Ireland 10 % TBills US Treasury Bills CashShortterm NA 0.00 % USA edit for more context I ’ ve had over $ 20k sitting in cash at IBKR since May for a potential Master ’ s in Europe need €15k for the visa School starts Late 2026 . I already got rejected from the research track and I ’ m waiting until April for the applied track results but I ’ m worried I ’ m too old at 30 compared to the 20yearolds with no_experience they seem to prefer . The opportunity cost is killing me I originally planned to buy gold and I ’ m still salty after losing 70 % due to currency devaluation of my EGP savings in 2021 waiting on a Canadian visa . Watching inexperienced kids get accepted over me is frustrating but I ’ m hoping my stock portfolio is diversified enough to cover the €15k around 18k USD so 30 % of my holdings at current prices if I finally get the green light ."

I have spent all this time researching it, and I finally decided to start at the beginning of 2026, until the time to start came and all of a sudden I felt very insecure about doing it. So, I am posting to ask for opinions, to make sure I am thinking the right way, or to highlight any wrongdoings. I live in Europe; my currency is the euro. I have about €20k in savings, and about 3k i would be confortable to start investing, I'm on the last year of university, don't have a job and still live with my parents (altough i plan to get a job and move out once i finish university). The goal is to invest for 30-40 years. I read a lot about an all world ETF, but i just don't think i want to do it. I think spreading the money across multiple ETF would be better to help me learn and understand the market, rather than sicking with just one and having no idea why it goes up or down (if that makes sense). My plan was to do 60% S&P500, 30% Stoxx 600 and 10% Emerging Markets. It felt right because it seems diversified and somewhat safe. But now i just feel like i'm \"replicating\" all world ETF, and started to think i should just buy that, even though i don't want to for the reasons i stated before. Is my plan good? Should i add or remove anything? Change the percenteges? I'm just looking for some guidance and/or reassurance. Thanks to everyone in advance!",

Here are the differences: * Over 5 years, IWLD has, excluding dividends, returned 12.8% (higher), while VOO has returned \\~12.6% (lower) * Over 5 years, IWLD has paid annual dividends of 1.20% - 1.21% (higher), while VOO has paid 1.10% - 1.20% (lower) * IWLD is ESG screened, so it cuts out the most harmful stocks, while VOO has no screening other than the S&P (it hold's Chevron (fossil fuels) Phillip Morris (tobacco) etc. * VOO's fees are lower (0.03) vs IWLD's (0.2) * IWLD is more diversified, with more mid-sized market caps and an international focus well beyond the US, while VOO is very US, large-cap and tech-stock-heavy * IWLD is less US currency exposed, whereas IWLD (being internationally invested and Australian-based) has a lower currency exposure to a country whose fiscal policy agenda is now very, very unstable When you look at the two ETFs, IWLD has grown more, returns more in dividends, costs more in fees, is more sustainable, is more diversified and is less currency exposed. On almost every metric, and in aggregate, it is a better fund. Why don't we see IWLD being promoted more for those whose brokers allow play in international markets?",

      "selftext": "After several quarters of research, I allocated 5% of my portfolio to crypto using a disciplined dollar-cost averaging approach. Sharing observations for others considering similar allocation. Initial concerns: * Volatility significantly higher than equity markets * Tax reporting complexity (every transaction is taxable event) * Custody risk (exchange solvency vs. self-custody operational risk) * Lack of automated investment tools comparable to traditional brokerages Implementation approach: Rather than lump-sum allocation, I structured weekly purchases to smooth volatility impact. Traditional advice suggests DCA for crypto given its cyclical nature. Execution infrastructure. Initial attempts through exchange recurring buys (Coinbase, Kraken) encountered issues: * High fees erode returns on small recurring purchases * Withdrawal restrictions complicate rebalancing * Tax reporting across multiple platforms problematic Transitioned to on-chain execution using Banana Pro. Comparable to setting up automated investment plan through brokerage - specify amount, frequency, asset allocation. Key advantages: 1) Lower transaction costs (especially on Solana) 2) Immediate custody (no exchange risk) 3) Consolidated transaction history 4) Cross-chain portfolio visibility Tax considerations: Every crypto transaction generates tax obligation. Using single platform for automated purchases simplifies cost basis tracking versus manual purchases across multiple exchanges. Results after 6 months: Portfolio behaving as expected - high volatility, but systematic approach prevents emotional decision-making during drawdowns. DCA averaging out market timing risk effectively. For those with small crypto allocation (3-10%), what systematic investment approach are you using? Still primarily through exchange recurring buys, or have you found more efficient execution methods?",

Initial attempts through exchange recurring buys Coinbase Kraken encountered issues High fees erode returns on small recurring purchases Withdrawal restrictions complicate rebalancing Tax reporting across multiple platforms problematic Transitioned to onchain execution using Banana Pro . Comparable to setting up automated investment plan through brokerage specify amount frequency asset allocation . Key advantages 1 Lower transaction costs especially on Solana 2 Immediate custody no exchange risk 3 Consolidated transaction history 4 Crosschain portfolio visibility Tax considerations Every crypto transaction generates tax obligation . Using single platform for automated purchases simplifies cost basis tracking versus manual purchases across multiple exchanges . Results after 6 months Portfolio behaving as expected high volatility but systematic approach prevents emotional decisionmaking during drawdowns . DCA averaging out market timing risk effectively . For those with small crypto allocation 310 % what systematic investment approach are you using Still primarily through exchange recurring buys or have you found more efficient execution methods"

The S&P500 or any of the large equity ETF'S (QQQ, VTI, etc...) are pretty much the best bet for long term investing and will almost certainly go up over time. 2. Gold is in a short term bubble and is not a sound long term investment. Gold will almost certainly go down over time. Where do you guys fall on these opinions? Why? Thanks so much for your thoughts!",

First trade was PAA calls, got bored on Monday and sold them for a small gain. Trade 2 was a ticker that cannot be named here. Saw volume increasing and though it could pop and decided to YOLO some short date options (broke my rule that options have to be at least a month or two out, but rules are meant to be broken). Got impatient today and sold them for a $10k loss. THEN things got interesting. Was mad so I bought some 0DTE INTC and ORCL calls today and spun about $40k into $75k (that was dumb, never again). Which brings me to LULU. They got hammered today because the Supreme Court tariff decision is delayed (we knew that would happen). LULU is already navigating a tariff world and doing just fine (see last earnings report). It’s in a clear uptrend since November and this thing will bounce. Feeling frisky so bought some calls that expire next week but majority in April 2026 calls with an earnings report before then. All $200 strike (no regarded OTMs). Got lucky with some dumb trades but going to be better. Too much trading in too short of time. Next stop $100k with goal of $500k by year end.",

      "selftext": "Hello all, Please take a look below at this plan and let me know your feedback. I appreciate you taking the time to time to read it. Context: I’m aiming to grow a $770,000 portfolio to $1,000,000 by Dec 31, 2026. I need a 29.8% total return. I’m balancing an advisor’s conservative S&P 500 anchor with my own high-conviction \"Alpha\" plays in the AI infrastructure and Nuclear sectors. Current Market Condition (Jan 9, 2026): Markets are at ATHs. S&P is testing 6,970. Geopolitical \"relief rallies\" are in full swing, but technicals look overextended. The plan: 1. The Allocation (The 50/50 Barbell) * Invested (50% - $385k): Strike-force deployment once the market hits a 1.5% pullback from today’s highs. * Cash Shield (50% - $385k): Held in SNSXX (3.42% yield) for dip-buying and risk mitigation. | Asset | Ticker | Weight | Amount | Strategy | |---|---|---|---|---| | S&P 500 | VOO | 40% | $154,000 | The Anchor (DRIP ON). | | Nasdaq 100 | QQQM | 20% | $77,000 | The Engine (DRIP ON). | | Nuclear/Uranium | NLR | 20% | $77,000 | The Power Bottleneck (DRIP OFF). | | Semiconductors | SMH | 10% | $38,500 | Sector-wide Speed (DRIP OFF). | | NVIDIA | NVDA | 5% | $19,250 | Pure GPU Alpha (DRIP OFF). | | Broadcom | AVGO | 5% | $19,250 | Custom Silicon Lead (DRIP OFF). | 2. The Rule Structure: * The Wait: No buying until VOO hits $629 or QQQM hits $254. I’m looking for 2 consecutive red days or a CPI-induced sell-off (Jan 15) to enter. * The Scalp (Aggressive): I have a $55k short-term capital loss carryover to use this year. At a 5% gain, I will harvest the profit into SNSXX. * The Runner Rule: For the satellites (NVDA, AVGO, NLR, SMH), I will replace Limit Orders with a 2% Trailing Stop once they hit +5% to capture potential parabolic moves. * The Dip Rule: I have 7 waves of $55,000 in cash. If any asset drops 5% from my strike price, I deploy one wave immediately. * The Phasing: If the market stays green, I deploy $55k into VOO/QQQM every 60 days (skipping April due to midterm election year historical soft patch). 3. Why this hits $1M in 2026 * $17.3k in risk-free SNSXX interest. * $55k in tax-neutralized scalps (thanks to the loss carryover). * $158k required from market growth. With NVDA Rubin cycle and Nuclear energy data center demand accelerating, this is the \"Physical AI\" play. Questions for the community: * Is a 2% Trailing Stop too tight for the 2026 \"vibration\" of chips? * Thoughts on skipping the April 1st phase in a midterm election year? * Am I holding too much cash ($385k) given the 29.8% return hurdle?",

Also, I'm not a VOO for lifer, but I don't hate that strategy. It seems to have worked very well in the past. \\--- The S&P 500 as we know it is likely a lot riskier right now than you may believe. The top 10 companies in that 500 company index fund currently make up 39.62% of the weight, and 9 of those 10 are throwing money at AI. To make matters a little more concerning, several of them are outpacing their revenue with cap expenditure into AI and funding the expenses using debt. Basically, I think that most of those companies are pretty overvalued (especially Tesla with its ridiculous \\~300 p/e ratio) and they could drop like a rock if the market takes a downturn. That's why I'm moving significant portions of my holdings to a **revenue-weighted** version of the S&P 500. I'm using Invesco's RWL, but there are many others that are basically the same. While their performances historically are damn near identical, revenue-weighted versions of the S&P 500 offer more diversification because the weighting inequality is much lower. For example, while the **top 10** of the normal S&P 500 make up nearly 40% of the fund, for RWL, the **top 24** make up around that much. Sure, it's going to be pretty similar in the long term, but in the short term, it looks like you're going to have a much smoother ride if the market takes a dive. **Edit: I should be clear about some of the downsides of RWL specifically.** Invesco ETFs generally have a much higher fee rate than Vanguard ETFs, and this is no exception. The comparison is 0.03% for Vanguard and 0.39% for Invesco. While the fees are 13x higher, I personally am okay with the higher fees for greater diversification. Because Vanguard's fee rate is so low, I personally haven't felt the difference yet, but **it is there and it is significant**. If Vanguard made a similarly weighted ETF, I would move to that one in a heartbeat. **Also, in the past, RWL hasn't performed better in down markets historically.** I think that an AI bubble burst would be different, however. RWL simply has less holdings in AI-forward stocks, meaning the potential for losses in such an event is lower.",

Think about every time you buy clothes online or grab concert tickets. DataDog is the one flagging slow pages and showing exactly what’s broken so it can get fixed fast. AI is fueling their growth big time. Not just by automating internal stuff, but by driving revenue. They have 500 AI-native clients already, and over 5,000 out of their 32,000 customers are using DataDog’s AI tools to track generative AI applications. That’s a huge opportunity to sell more AI solutions to their existing users. As more companies jump on AI, DataDog becomes even more critical. Everyone needs their integrations to keep apps running smoothly. All my engineer friends at work swear by it. No contest, leader in observability. Their revenue keeps climbing like a straight line up, almost no marketing spend, and retention is insane. I’m holding $DDOG and I honestly think this thing could make a lot of people rich long term. Holding 6455 shares at $129.99 this is not financial advice just my opinion",

Think about every time you buy clothes online or grab concert tickets . DataDog is the one flagging slow pages and showing exactly what ’ s broken so it can get fixed fast . AI is fueling their growth big time . Not_just by automating internal stuff but by driving revenue . They have 500 AInative clients already and over 5000 out of their 32000 customers are using DataDog ’ s AI tools to track generative AI applications . That ’ s a huge opportunity to sell more AI solutions to their existing users . As more companies jump on AI DataDog becomes even more critical . Everyone needs their integrations to keep apps running smoothly . All my engineer friends at work swear by it . No_contest leader in observability . Their revenue keeps climbing like a straight line up almost no_marketing spend and retention is insane . I ’ m holding $ DDOG and I honestly think this thing could make a lot of people rich long term . Holding 6455 shares at $ 129.99 this is not_financial advice just my opinion"

Over time, especially after sitting through periods of volatility and uncertainty, that assumption slowly broke down. What actually seemed to matter more was patience: staying invested, not reacting to every headline, and accepting that doing nothing is often the hardest part of the process. Intelligence helps, but patience appears to compound in a different way I’m curious when this realization happened for others. Was it after a specific market event, a personal mistake, or simply enough years in the market to see patterns repeat ?",

What actually seemed to matter more was patience staying invested not_reacting to every headline and accepting that doing nothing_is often the hardest part of the process . Intelligence helps but patience appears to compound in a different way I ’ m curious when this realization happened for others . Was it after a specific market event a personal mistake or simply enough years in the market to see patterns repeat"

      "selftext": "Hello all. I'm trying to understand something and am having a hard time finding clear information online. Hopefully someone here can point me to some good info. I'm mostly an invest-and-forget kind of investor, but do play with options a little just for fun (options buy would typically be less than 0.1% of my total investments). For my options \"play\" I have always used my Roth IRA with ETrade, which I've had for a couple of decades at least. In ETrade I could sell a position (stock or options) and immediately use that money to buy something else. I moved that account to Schwab (much more modern interface and some nice research tools), and found out I can't do that - I can't spend the proceeds of a sale until the sale settles. WTF? Is that really a common thing? I'm fairly certain I can sell/buy immediately in my Vanguard account too, but I don't trade actively enough to really say for sure - mostly mutual funds there, so I have to wait for the end of the day for the sale to happen anyway. I just never realized, I guess. I saw something that says if I enable margin trading at Schwab, then I can buy immediately on margin and when the sale settles it will close that margin loan and there will be no interest (if it happens same-day). This was stated in a reddit comment by someone, but I can't find that info in any Schwab documents, so I'm not sure how much to trust it. I didn't set up margin on that account, because I don't want to actually borrow to invest, but maybe ETrade really worked through margin, and I just didn't know? A little more backstory, and I'm hoping I didn't make a rash move: I was trying to simplify my overall investment situation, as right now I've got investments in various accounts over 5 different companies. I'm stuck with two of those (employer-driven), one of which is Fidelity, and my original thought was to move my Roth from ETrade to Fidelity. ETrade keeps getting moved/bought, and doesn't keep their interface very up-to-date so it just feels old and clunky (and sometimes just doesn't work, although that seems to have been improving lately). Plus, simplifying by having fewer companies would be good. Unfortunately, Fidelity customer service really pissed me off, and they were utterly incompetent - I tried for over 3 weeks to get that account moved - online didn't work, talking to customer service didn't work, they put in a tech support ticket, and that didn't work, they sent me paper forms but then I'd need to find a place to print and sign... it was a mess. Schwab account was set up in less than 10 minutes, including the account transfer request, which settled in less than a week. Yay! No simplification for me, however (one company swapped out for another new one, albeit one with a nicer trading platform), and I probably didn't investigate carefully enough -- I set it up mostly because I was fed up with the incompetence of Fidelity customer service, which is a bad reason to make a decision. Vanguard would have been easy, but if I move retirement accounts there (possible) I'd have 99% of my assets with one company, which I'm trying to avoid. And their trading platform is terrible. Ugh. It shouldn't be this complicated....",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello all . Im trying to understand something and am having a hard time finding clear information online . Hopefully someone here can point me to some good info . Im mostly an investandforget kind of investor but do play with options a little just for fun options buy would typically be less than 0.1 % of my total investments . For my options play I have always used my Roth IRA with ETrade which Ive had for a couple of decades at least . In ETrade I could sell a position stock or options and immediately use that money to buy something else . I moved that account to Schwab much more modern interface and some nice research tools and found out I cant do that I cant spend the proceeds of a sale until the sale settles . WTF Is that really a common thing Im fairly certain I can sellbuy immediately in my Vanguard account too but I dont trade actively enough to really say for sure mostly mutual funds there so I have to wait for the end of the day for the sale to happen anyway . I just never_realized I guess . I saw something that says if I enable margin trading at Schwab then I can buy immediately on margin and when the sale settles it will close that margin loan and there will be no_interest if it happens sameday . This was stated in a reddit comment by someone but I cant find that info in any Schwab documents so Im not_sure how much to trust it . I didnt set up margin on that account because I dont want to actually borrow to invest but maybe ETrade really worked through margin and I just didnt know A little more backstory and Im hoping I didnt make a rash move I was trying to simplify my overall investment situation as right now Ive got investments in various accounts over 5 different companies . Im stuck with two of those employerdriven one of which is Fidelity and my original thought was to move my Roth from ETrade to Fidelity . ETrade keeps getting movedbought and doesnt keep their interface very uptodate so it just feels old and clunky and sometimes just doesnt work although that seems to have been improving lately . Plus simplifying by having fewer companies would be good . Unfortunately Fidelity customer service really pissed me off and they were utterly incompetent I tried for over 3 weeks to get that account moved online didnt work talking to customer service didnt work they put in a tech support ticket and that didnt work they sent me paper forms but then Id need to find a place to print and sign ... it was a mess . Schwab account was set up in less than 10 minutes including the account transfer request which settled in less than a week . Yay No_simplification for me however one company swapped out for another new one albeit one with a nicer trading platform and I probably didnt investigate carefully enough I set it up mostly because I was fed up with the incompetence of Fidelity customer service which is a bad reason to make a decision . Vanguard would have been easy but if I move retirement accounts there possible Id have 99 % of my assets with one company which Im trying to avoid . And their trading platform is terrible . Ugh . It shouldnt be this complicated ...."

      "selftext": "I am a U.S. citizen living in Germany. This is nice for many reasons, but causes some real headaches for investment. Long story short, normal U.S. brokers won't let me buy ETFs etc. without a US address, and if I buy the same in Germany I will be double-taxed into oblivion. The U.S. taxes citizens regardless of where they live, and disincentives for \"passive foreign income\" screw expats over. However, buying individual stocks and bonds is not \"passive\" and therefore avoids the double taxation problem. I understand this as a loser's game and would vastly prefer the buy-and-forget index fund approach, but that's not an option for me. So my questions: * Is it possible to \"simulate\" an index fund by simply buying a large quantity of individual stocks and bonds? Or would this take a life-consuming amount of effort to do without massive risk? * Am I better off just parking my money in bonds or bond-like accounts (Raisin etc.)? * Are there other reasonable investment approaches that anyone in a similar situation has taken? **TLDR** I'm hoping to approximate as closely as I can the \"normal\" investing approach that a working person in the USA would take, but I have to do so without \"passive\" index funds.",

You still need to watch loan originators, understand how buyback works, and accept that liquidity can disappear when market sentiment changes. On the positive side, cash flow is more predictable than stocks and volatility feels lower on the surface. On the negative side, platform risk is very real and trust matters more than headline returns.

      "title": "QXO: A boring roofing roll up company with potential for explosive growth",
      "selftext": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs, a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation. The company is executing a roll-up strategy in building products distribution, an extremely large, fragmented, and under-digitized industry. The investment case is less about short-term housing cycles and more about disciplined M&A, operational improvement, and long-term compounding. QXO operates in building materials distribution, with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products. It supplies contractors with products such as shingles, insulation, siding, waterproofing, and related materials. Key characteristics of the industry: * \\~$800B total addressable market * Highly fragmented, dominated by regional operators * Low digital penetration * Logistics-intensive and relationship-driven * Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital, systems, and operational discipline. The core of the thesis is management. Brad Jacobs has built multiple large-scale industrial platforms: * **United Waste:** sold for \\~$2.5B * **United Rentals (URI):** became the largest equipment rental company globally * **XPO Logistics:** \\~30x return, later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses, Jacobs followed a consistent playbook: 1. Enter fragmented industries 2. Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3. Standardize operations 4. Invest heavily in technology 5. Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500+ acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex, asset-heavy businesses. At QXO, he has invested roughly $900M of his own capital, alongside large institutional partners, creating strong alignment with shareholders. An important, often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected, long-duration capital. Jared Kushner, through his firm Affinity Partners, invested $150M in QXO and holds a board seat. While QXO is not a government contractor, these relationships matter in an industry influenced by: * Housing policy * Infrastructure investment * Disaster recovery funding * Insurance regulation * Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technology-enabled industrial operator. Technology is being deployed across: * Pricing and margin optimization * Demand forecasting and inventory planning * Route optimization and fleet utilization * Quoting and order management * Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses, QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries. Control allows standardization. Several structural tailwinds support the business: * \\~80% of roofing demand is non-discretionary * Aging U.S. housing stock * Increased frequency of storm and disaster-related repairs * Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement * Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housing-cycle narratives suggest. [Also, Apollo just invested $1+ billion - ]( you think you're smarter than Apollo? TLDR; Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because I'm an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely, so bought back in.",

Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500 acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex assetheavy businesses . At QXO he has invested roughly $ 900M of his own capital alongside large institutional partners creating strong alignment with shareholders . An important often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected longduration capital . Jared Kushner through his firm Affinity Partners invested $ 150M in QXO and holds a board seat . While QXO is not_a government contractor these relationships matter in an industry influenced by Housing policy Infrastructure investment Disaster recovery funding Insurance regulation Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technologyenabled industrial operator . Technology is being deployed across Pricing and margin optimization Demand forecasting and inventory planning Route optimization and fleet utilization Quoting and order management Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries . Control allows standardization . Several structural tailwinds support the business 80 % of roofing demand is nondiscretionary Aging U.S. housing stock Increased frequency of storm and disasterrelated repairs Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housingcycle narratives suggest . Also Apollo just invested $ 1 billion you think youre smarter than Apollo TLDR Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because Im an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely so bought back in ."
