      "selftext": "I've been in the market long enough to realize one thing: more research does NOT automatically mean better decisions. Early on, I did what everyone praises: • Read every SEC filing • Dig through earnings calls line by line • Compare competitors, TAM, margins, moats... you name it At some point, research stopped being a tool and turned into a hiding place. Hiding from making a decision. Hiding from being wrong. Here's what experience taught me the hard way: 1. If your thesis can't fit on half a page, you don't have a thesis. It's just information hoarding. 2. Most data is noise once you've identified the 2-3 variables that actually move the business. Revenue driver, cost structure, capital allocation. The rest is intellectual entertainment. 3. Buffett-style investing isn't about reading everything. It's about knowing what to ignore. My process now is brutally simple: • Start with a single falsifiable thesis • Define what would make me wrong before I read more • Time-box research aggressively • Stop the moment new info stops changing the decision If after that I'm still unsure, I pass. Missing a trade is cheap. Being stuck in analysis paralysis is expensive. Curious how others handle this: • Do you use strict checklists? • Hard time limits? • Or do you accept that research never really \"ends\"? Interested to hear from people who've been through a few cycles - not just theory.",

Hiding from making a decision . Hiding from being wrong . Heres what experience taught me the hard way 1 . If your thesis cant fit on half a page you dont have a thesis . Its just information hoarding . 2 . Most data is noise once youve identified the 23 variables that actually move the business . Revenue driver cost structure capital allocation . The rest is intellectual entertainment . 3 . Buffettstyle investing isnt about reading everything . Its about knowing what to ignore . My process now is brutally simple • Start with a single falsifiable thesis • Define what would make me wrong before I read more • Timebox research aggressively • Stop the moment new info stops changing the decision If after that Im still unsure I pass . Missing a trade is cheap . Being stuck in analysis paralysis is expensive . Curious how others handle this • Do you use strict checklists • Hard time limits • Or do you accept that research never_really ends Interested to hear from people whove been through a few cycles not_just theory ."

      "selftext": "Q3 2025 net income = -$21.39 million Q4 2025 net income = $38.95 million Increase = 17.56m (profitable!) So why the shift? Webull has been spending heavily on infrastructure and global expansion. They recently added crypto and predictions and are now exclusively the only platform enabling hourlies on the spx index. It is a beefy platform and the mobile app runs flawlessly - with more features than many desktop apps can dream of. Ai assistant was implemented. Lots of partnerships and expendature led to a messy income statement. But earnings in q4 2025 tells a different story. Theyre just getting ramped up and already millions profitable quarterly, within same year they spent the money! 2026 Q1 earnings will set the stage for this year, and with customer assets having steadily climbed with each quarter along with user engagement, it seems all sunshine and rainbows. But the stock itself is telling a different story - reaching new lows day after day. Discussions on various forums continue to state unprofitibility and \"chinese ownership\" as a problem. In other words, fud is churning, retail is selling (per robinhood stat) and hedge funds are.. buying? Thats right, hedge funds are aggressively adding right now. At the same time, short interest at an all time high and every day we see a short volume ratio of 25! Furthermore, the stock is massively overleveraged. The irony here is more losers than winners if the stock suddenly starts to run up violently as over 50 million shares are already called for - thus locking investors in place or forcing them to buy shares. The losses to gamma would be absolutely biblical and be on the front page of every investor newspaper. But this is very unlikely to happen. So here we are with a company whos rapidly expanding, seeing ROI on expendature a mere quarter later, and hosts the most capable mobile retail brokerage app to ever exist by huge margin. And yet today its stock tanked for the 9th consecutive day and took a 5% hit. So what does the future hold for webull? *concentrates* An intense warzone between fundamentals, fud, and manipulators. Weve seen a company doesnt have to make money to blast off to the moon (tesla) but.. what if the opposite is true for a company who makes money too fast? Could it be that... we see inverse tesla, and webull reaches its low analyst target of 74 cents per share? The answer is.. yes. Becouse we are in a different market landscape now for where gamma, hedge funds, and fud are king. Fundamentals have not played a part in a long time. An unprofitable company can be worth a quarter trillion while a profitable one is worth 3 billion. Webull just happens to be the first major victim of this paradigm shift.",

They recently added crypto and predictions and are now exclusively the only platform enabling hourlies on the spx index . It is a beefy platform and the mobile app runs flawlessly with more features than many desktop apps can dream of . Ai assistant was implemented . Lots of partnerships and expendature led to a messy income statement . But earnings in q4 2025 tells a different story . Theyre just getting ramped up and already millions profitable quarterly within same year they spent the money 2026 Q1 earnings will set the stage for this year and with customer assets having steadily climbed with each quarter along with user engagement it seems all sunshine and rainbows . But the stock itself is telling a different story reaching new lows day after day . Discussions on various forums continue to state unprofitibility and chinese ownership as a problem . In other words fud is churning retail is selling per robinhood stat and hedge funds are .. buying Thats right hedge funds are aggressively adding right now . At the same time short interest at an all time high and every day we see a short volume ratio of 25 Furthermore the stock is massively overleveraged . The irony here is more losers than winners if the stock suddenly starts to run up violently as over 50 million shares are already called for thus locking investors in place or forcing them to buy shares . The losses to gamma would be absolutely biblical and be on the front page of every investor newspaper . But this is very unlikely to happen . So here we are with a company whos rapidly expanding seeing ROI on expendature a mere quarter later and hosts the most capable mobile retail brokerage app to ever exist by huge margin . And yet today its stock tanked for the 9th consecutive day and took a 5 % hit . So what does the future hold for webull concentrates An intense warzone between fundamentals fud and manipulators . Weve seen a company doesnt have to make money to blast off to the moon tesla but .. what if the opposite is true for a company who makes money too fast Could it be that ... we see inverse tesla and webull reaches its low analyst target of 74 cents per share The answer is .. yes . Becouse we are in a different market landscape now for where gamma hedge funds and fud are king . Fundamentals have not_played a part in a long time . An unprofitable company can be worth a quarter trillion while a profitable one is worth 3 billion . Webull just happens to be the first major victim of this paradigm shift ."

      "selftext": "[Breaking News] - Speaking at the premiere for “Melania,” the film about first lady Melania Trump, the president said the five-month odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end. The process for deciding on Powell’s replacement began in September with an 11-candidate field that included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investment professionals. The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will be naming his pick Friday for the new Federal Reserve chair. Speaking at the premiere for “Melania,” the film about first lady Melania Trump, the president said the five-month odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end. “I’ll be announcing the Fed chair tomorrow morning,” Trump said. Asked if he had actually settled on a choice, he replied, “I do, I better, otherwise I have to go to work very quickly.” The process for deciding on Powell’s replacement began in September with an 11-candidate field that included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investment professionals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent screened the qualifying candidates, whittling the list down to five and then four. The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder. Prediction markets have been betting on who gets the job. Hassett had been the leader for some time, then Warsh and for the past several days Rieder. However, that flipped Thursday evening, with Kalshi now putting Warsh as a prohibitive 80% favorite. An administration source told CNBC that Warsh was at the White House on Thursday. However, a White House official dismissed speculation. “President Trump will make an announcement about his pick for the Federal Reserve at the appropriate juncture. Any and all reporting on the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process until then is a waste of everyone’s time,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. For his part, Powell balked at questions over whether he will stay on after his term as chair expires in May. Powell has the option of serving out the remaining two years on his governor’s term.",

      "selftext": "You should look into Etsy and their general circular internal stock compensation/buyback series. Outgoing CEO Josh Silverman was paid over $200 million in sold stock compensation, at a time when the company was overpaying for acquisitions, as seen in their recent dispositions at a 90% loss. While paying executives excessive comp packages, they have announced a non-expiring $1 billion share buyback program as the company sees fit. All the while, they have $3 billion + in debt on the balance sheet that ballooned as a result of the failed acquisitions. The company is not investing in the future, they simply are propping up their share price as the marketplace continues to be flooded with mass-manufactured products and overseas sellers. Their partnerships with AI are further very ambiguous, costing sellers more, and ultimately removing ETSY's need for existence. AI may eventually replace the marketplace altogether by selling direct and allowing customers to engage directly with sellers without the need for Etsy. While some of the above is speculation of the future, the aggressive share buyback program in a time where the company is high in debt, and low in growth, is creating a false sense of value. Etsy is trading at a 38 P/E after recent decline compared to EBAY's 20 P/E and EBAY has been much more successful in terms of scale, margins, and growth since 2021. Price Target would be in the low $30s.",

      "selftext_processed": "You should look into Etsy and their general circular internal stock compensationbuyback series . Outgoing CEO Josh Silverman was paid over $ 200 million in sold stock compensation at a time when the company was overpaying for acquisitions as seen in their recent dispositions at a 90 % loss . While paying executives excessive comp packages they have announced a nonexpiring $ 1 billion share buyback program as the company sees fit . All the while they have $ 3 billion in debt on the balance sheet that ballooned as a result of the failed acquisitions . The company is not_investing in the future they simply are propping up their share price as the marketplace continues to be flooded with massmanufactured products and overseas sellers . Their partnerships with AI are further very ambiguous costing sellers more and ultimately removing ETSYs need for existence . AI may eventually replace the marketplace altogether by selling direct and allowing customers to engage directly with sellers without the need for Etsy . While some of the above is speculation of the future the aggressive share buyback program in a time where the company is high in debt and low in growth is creating a false sense of value . Etsy is trading at a 38 PE after recent decline compared to EBAYs 20 PE and EBAY has been much more successful in terms of scale margins and growth since 2021 . Price Target would be in the low $ 30s ."

      "selftext": "Elon Musk's SpaceX and xAI are in merger talks ahead of initial public offering later this year. Under the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX (SPACEX). Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction. A merger would combine Musk's rockets, Starlink satellites, the social media platform X and GrokAI chatbot under one roof, according to the report. Some xAI executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal, according to Reuters. A final agreement hasn't been signed and the timing and structure of a transaction remain fluid. Musk, SpaceX, and xAI didn't respond to Reuters requests for comment. The Financial Times reported earlier that SpaceX is looking at a mid-June IPO, aiming to raise as much as $50B at valuation of roughly $1.5T. Tesla said on Wednesday that it will invest about $2B in xAI.",

      "title": "A Degenerate's Rough Draft to Options Trading for Idiots.",
      "selftext": "I'm not very eloquent with words, nor am I well spoken, but here it goes. Been a WSB lurker since 2018 or so, but didn't start trading options until 2025. I started with a very small percentage of my total trading account and now my options account has blown up to almost 25x of what I started with. My returns aren't quite 2500% on this account due to two reasons. 1. I traded my first option in my main portfolio and made 20% on that. I then created a new account just for options and moved 1k into it + the gains from my first options trade. 2. I accidentally selected my main account, instead of my options account when buying a couple of options. Once I liquidated those positions, I transferred the gains into my options account. No one can predict the market, so everyone asking for advice on what to invest in, no one really knows for certain. No such things as 100% free money. I will share some of the rules I've made for myself that seem to be working pretty well. Feel free to contribute or question my thought process. In no particular order. 1. Never trade with emotion. No FOMO trading. No revenge trading. No YOLO trading. If you get upset about how at trade turned out or about missing out on gains, I walk away and don't trade until I cool off. Sometimes it's a day or two, sometimes it's more than a month. 2. If you're getting upset or bothered by the ups or downs of one of your positions, you probably are in too deep on that trade and need to trade smaller amounts. 3. Building off the previous point, I don't ever put more than 20% of my capital in any single position to start. So okay, this is a very bad rule, and realistically, it should probably be closer to 5%, but this is within \\*my\\* risk tolerance. 4. This gets repeated a lot here, but it's a good one. \"No one ever went broke realizing gains\" and \"Gains > no gains\". Don't be afraid to realize gains when you're positions is up 50% up. I've let some positions ride up to 200%, but I realize most gains between 30% to 50%. 5. This is a big one. I don't play anything with an expiration shorter than 3 months. Most of my call options are between 3 to 6 months out. A couple over a year out. Yes, this also means I never touch 0DTEs. I also don't play earnings. 6. Realize the difference between luck and skill. I know I've gotten lucky a lot and I don't confuse it with being skilled. Skill means you can consistently repeat something. 7. There will ALWAYS be another opportunity, so don't force a bad trade to try to make money. 8. DO YOUR FUCKING RESEARCH. Google is a great tool and even just reading random posts on WSB will give you random piece of insight. Granted, 98% of WSB is shit posting, so you have a lot of crap to filter through. If you don't know what something is, research it. Bare minimum, learn the principles of options, both long and short. Learn the greeks, and what Implied Volatility and IV crush are. 9. I rarely trade against momentum, unless I have a really good reason to. Timing the bottom and top are hard. I think I've done it maybe twice in 50+ trades. 10. Don't forget the tax man and don't forget to treat yourself. Note: Almost everyone who reaches out to you for their course, newsletters, tool, scanner, or whatever is a scam. More than likely, they'll try to charge you some fee for information or tools. Yeah, all a scam.",

      "selftext_processed": "Im not_very eloquent with words nor am I well spoken but here it goes . Been a WSB lurker since 2018 or so but didnt start trading options until 2025 . I started with a very small percentage of my total trading account and now my options account has blown up to almost 25x of what I started with . My returns arent quite 2500 % on this account due to two reasons . 1 . I traded my first option in my main portfolio and made 20 % on that . I then created a new account just for options and moved 1k into it the gains from my first options trade . 2 . I accidentally selected my main account instead of my options account when buying a couple of options . Once I liquidated those positions I transferred the gains into my options account . No_one can predict the market so everyone asking for advice on what to invest in no_one really knows for certain . No_such things as 100 % free money . I will share some of the rules Ive made for myself that seem to be working pretty well . Feel free to contribute or question my thought process . In no_particular order . 1 . Never_trade with emotion . No_FOMO trading . No_revenge trading . No_YOLO trading . If you get upset about how at trade turned out or about missing out on gains I walk away and dont trade until I cool off . Sometimes its a day or two sometimes its more than a month . 2 . If youre getting upset or bothered by the ups or downs of one of your positions you probably are in too deep on that trade and need to trade smaller amounts . 3 . Building off the previous point I dont ever put more than 20 % of my capital in any single position to start . So okay this is a very bad rule and realistically it should probably be closer to 5 % but this is within my risk tolerance . 4 . This gets repeated a lot here but its a good one . No one ever went broke realizing gains and Gains no_gains . Dont be afraid to realize gains when youre positions is up 50 % up . Ive let some positions ride up to 200 % but I realize most gains between 30 % to 50 % . 5 . This is a big one . I dont play anything with an expiration shorter than 3 months . Most of my call options are between 3 to 6 months out . A couple over a year out . Yes this also means I never_touch 0DTEs . I also dont play earnings . 6 . Realize the difference between luck and skill . I know Ive gotten lucky a lot and I dont confuse it with being skilled . Skill means you can consistently repeat something . 7 . There will ALWAYS be another opportunity so dont force a bad trade to try to make money . 8 . DO YOUR FUCKING RESEARCH . Google is a great tool and even just reading random posts on WSB will give you random piece of insight . Granted 98 % of WSB is shit posting so you have a lot of crap to filter through . If you dont know what something is research it . Bare minimum learn the principles of options both long and short . Learn the greeks and what Implied Volatility and IV crush are . 9 . I rarely trade against momentum unless I have a really good reason to . Timing the bottom and top are hard . I think Ive done it maybe twice in 50 trades . 10 . Dont forget the tax man and dont forget to treat yourself . Note Almost everyone who reaches out to you for their course newsletters tool scanner or whatever is a scam . More than likely theyll try to charge you some fee for information or tools . Yeah all a scam ."

      "selftext": "Hi! You all know that when markets open they are always somewhat unstable and often rise or fall sharply; there are enormous variations in the first few minutes of the markets (I'm referring to the US markets, which are the only ones that interest me). For example, today the markets started the day falling immensely, most likely due to the shutdown. I didn't know about the shutdown because I'm not American, but if I had known, I could have anticipated the abrupt variation the market experienced at the opening. Is there a way to know, with some certainty, what will happen when the US markets open? Is there somewhere we can discuss the behavior of the markets each day as they open? Thank you very much.

My fiancé and I are closing on a house in 2 weeks and I am considering selling off some stocks to boost the down payment (about 20% of the down payment will be from my investments). I have 2 questions: 1. I have a Schwab account that I personally control investments on, and a Qapital robo-investing account that does it for me! I can either cash out some of my Qapital, which would simplify stock choices, or sell investments from my Schwab account, where I would have to choose which stocks/etfs/etc I'm selling. My Qapital accounts are honestly doing pretty well, but the idea of choosing stocks is daunting! Which would you recommend? 2. If I go ahead and sell stocks using my Schwab account, how do I best choose which stocks to sell?

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m 19 and based in Canada. I invest mainly through TFSA and FHSA accounts, which are essentially Roth IRA equivalents. I’ll soon be receiving about $14,000 USD of new, non-taxable capital. This is long-term money and I’m explicitly trying to outperform the S&P 500, fully accepting higher volatility and drawdowns. I already have a growth- and tech-heavy portfolio. Roughly speaking, my current exposure looks like this: • NBIS (AI / infrastructure): \\~35% • ASTS (satellite connectivity): \\~20% • GOOG: \\~15% • RKLB (space launch): \\~10% • MU (semiconductors): \\~5% • XAR (aerospace & defense ETF): \\~5% • Small ETH exposure and other minor positions: \\~10% So I’m already very far from the index, intentionally. I am looking for stock picks, especially ideas that could reasonably outperform over a long horizon and that would complement or strengthen this portfolio rather than just add more of the same exposure. I’m interested in: • high-quality growth • infrastructure or platform businesses • situations with strong long-term Not looking to trade or gamble, and not looking for short-term hype. I’m more interested in ideas with a clear multi-year thesis. Curious to hear what names you’d be looking at if you were deploying fresh capital with this objective. Thanks.",

I ’ ll soon be receiving about $ 14000 USD of new nontaxable capital . This is longterm money and I ’ m explicitly trying to outperform the SP 500 fully accepting higher volatility and drawdowns . I already have a growth and techheavy portfolio . Roughly speaking my current exposure looks like this • NBIS AI infrastructure 35 % • ASTS satellite connectivity 20 % • GOOG 15 % • RKLB space launch 10 % • MU semiconductors 5 % • XAR aerospace defense ETF 5 % • Small ETH exposure and other minor positions 10 % So I ’ m already very far from the index intentionally . I am looking for stock picks especially ideas that could reasonably outperform over a long horizon and that would complement or strengthen this portfolio rather than just add more of the same exposure . I ’ m interested in • highquality growth • infrastructure or platform businesses • situations with strong longterm Not_looking to trade or gamble and not_looking for shortterm hype . I ’ m more interested in ideas with a clear multiyear thesis . Curious to hear what names you ’ d be looking at if you were deploying fresh capital with this objective . Thanks ."

      "selftext": "In an extraordinary display of confidence that has sent ripples through Silicon Valley’s executive corridors, ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott has committed $20 million of his personal wealth to purchase company stock while simultaneously pledging to remain at the helm through 2030. This dual announcement represents one of the most significant insider stock purchases by a sitting technology CEO in recent years and signals a dramatic vote of confidence in the enterprise software company’s long-term trajectory at a time when the sector faces mounting pressure from artificial intelligence disruption and economic uncertainty. According to Business Insider, McDermott’s substantial investment comes as ServiceNow navigates a critical inflection point in its evolution from workflow automation provider to AI-powered enterprise platform. The move is particularly noteworthy given that most executives typically receive stock compensation rather than purchasing shares with after-tax personal funds, making this transaction a powerful statement about McDermott’s conviction in the company’s strategic direction. The timing of this announcement carries special significance as ServiceNow competes against tech giants like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Oracle in the rapidly evolving enterprise software market. McDermott’s commitment to lead the company for another six years provides stability and continuity that investors increasingly value in an era where CEO tenures have been shrinking and leadership transitions have become more frequent and disruptive across the technology sector.

According to Business Insider McDermott ’ s substantial investment comes as ServiceNow navigates a critical inflection point in its evolution from workflow automation provider to AIpowered enterprise platform . The move is particularly noteworthy given that most executives typically receive stock compensation rather than purchasing shares with aftertax personal funds making this transaction a powerful statement about McDermott ’ s conviction in the company ’ s strategic direction . The timing of this announcement carries special significance as ServiceNow competes against tech giants like Microsoft Salesforce and Oracle in the rapidly evolving enterprise software market . McDermott ’ s commitment to lead the company for another six years provides stability and continuity that investors increasingly value in an era where CEO tenures have been shrinking and leadership transitions have become more frequent and disruptive across the technology sector ."

      "title": "contrarian names I like better for 2026 than MSFT",
      "selftext": "I just posted about MSFT and the OpenAI concentration risk that’s weighing on it right now. Here are five other contrarian names I like better for 2026 setups. These got hammered in 2025 on sector weakness or execution fears, but each has concrete near-term pops from production ramps, restructurings, or demand surges. Rivian (RIVN) trades at 18 to 19 billion market cap after EV slowdown fears. It sells at 3 to 4 times forward sales, way below Tesla. The big trigger hits early 2026 when R2 production starts in Normal, Illinois, with validation builds already rolling off the line in January and first customer deliveries expected by June. Volumes should double or more as R2 ramps on a single shift through 2026, pushing toward breakeven margins. Rivian carves a moat in adventure EVs with rugged design and off-road focus that Tesla’s Cybertruck hasn’t fully nailed yet, plus locked-in supplier costs for higher-volume profitability. FMC sits at about 2 billion market cap after a 73% drop last year from weak ag demand and cash collection issues in South America. P/E at 4 times looks dirt cheap, 96% below peers, with earnings growth projected over 50%. Latin America rebound plus aggressive cost cuts and restructuring (shifting production to lower-cost spots) drive FCF back to 285 million in 2026. The moat comes from proprietary crop protection chemicals that generics struggle to match fully, and new direct-sales models to big growers bypass distributors for better margins and control. Fluor (FLR) around 7 to 8 billion builds data centers and nuclear with 82% reimbursable backlog to cut risk. GPU and hyperscaler demand ramps hard in 2026, plus SMR work. The NuScale stake monetization wraps by end of Q2 2026 via structured share sales, unlocking cash for buybacks. Moat builds from reimbursable contracts that limit downside on big energy/infra projects, and long-term engineering edge in nuclear and data center construction where few players scale like this. Ciena (CIEN) at 34 to 36 billion has a PEG of 1.24 times, 30% discount to sector. Optical networking explodes from AI data center interconnect needs. EPS upgrades run strong (15 up, zero down recently), and management guides FY26 revenue to 5.7 to 6.1 billion, up about 24% at midpoint on a 5 billion backlog. The moat strengthens as the “nervous system” for AI clusters with high-capacity coherent optics that handle massive data moves between buildings or sites, where competitors lag on speed and low-latency scale. L3Harris (LHX) around 67 billion in defense tech gets a jolt from the Missile Solutions spin-off. The Pentagon invests 1 billion convertible preferred that turns to equity on IPO in second half 2026, creating a standalone rocket motor company while L3Harris keeps control and a leaner core. This unlocks value in higher-margin propulsion systems amid budget tailwinds for missiles and cyber/space. Moat grows from solid rocket motor production scale (from Aerojet acquisition) that’s hard to replicate fast, plus direct DoD partnership for capacity ramp. I hope i am right.",

      "selftext_processed": "I just posted about MSFT and the OpenAI concentration risk that ’ s weighing on it right now . Here are five other contrarian names I like better for 2026 setups . These got hammered in 2025 on sector weakness or execution fears but each has concrete nearterm pops from production ramps restructurings or demand surges . Rivian RIVN trades at 18 to 19 billion market cap after EV slowdown fears . It sells at 3 to 4 times forward sales way below Tesla . The big trigger hits early 2026 when R2 production starts in Normal Illinois with validation builds already rolling off the line in January and first customer deliveries expected by June . Volumes should double or more as R2 ramps on a single shift through 2026 pushing toward breakeven margins . Rivian carves a moat in adventure EVs with rugged design and offroad focus that Tesla ’ s Cybertruck hasn ’ t fully nailed yet plus lockedin supplier costs for highervolume profitability . FMC sits at about 2 billion market cap after a 73 % drop last year from weak ag demand and cash collection issues in South America . PE at 4 times looks dirt cheap 96 % below peers with earnings growth projected over 50 % . Latin America rebound plus aggressive cost cuts and restructuring shifting production to lowercost spots drive FCF back to 285 million in 2026 . The moat comes from proprietary crop protection chemicals that generics struggle to match fully and new directsales models to big growers bypass distributors for better margins and control . Fluor FLR around 7 to 8 billion builds data centers and nuclear with 82 % reimbursable backlog to cut risk . GPU and hyperscaler demand ramps hard in 2026 plus SMR work . The NuScale stake monetization wraps by end of Q2 2026 via structured share sales unlocking cash for buybacks . Moat builds from reimbursable contracts that limit downside on big energyinfra projects and longterm engineering edge in nuclear and data center construction where few players scale like this . Ciena CIEN at 34 to 36 billion has a PEG of 1.24 times 30 % discount to sector . Optical networking explodes from AI data center interconnect needs . EPS upgrades run strong 15 up zero down recently and management guides FY26 revenue to 5.7 to 6.1 billion up about 24 % at midpoint on a 5 billion backlog . The moat strengthens as the “ nervous system ” for AI clusters with highcapacity coherent optics that handle massive data moves between buildings or sites where competitors lag on speed and lowlatency scale . L3Harris LHX around 67 billion in defense tech gets a jolt from the Missile Solutions spinoff . The Pentagon invests 1 billion convertible preferred that turns to equity on IPO in second half 2026 creating a standalone rocket motor company while L3Harris keeps control and a leaner core . This unlocks value in highermargin propulsion systems amid budget tailwinds for missiles and cyberspace . Moat grows from solid rocket motor production scale from Aerojet acquisition that ’ s hard to replicate fast plus direct DoD partnership for capacity ramp . I hope i am right ."

BUT, this is just the beginning. What happened today is something I felt would happen - they spun off their auto OEM to focus Modine on data centers and edge computing. To say this company will be huge is an UNDERSTATEMENT. Read everything I wrote in that post - it will all happen. Here's how it'll play out: MSFT and Meta will continue spending on capex -> MOD goes up. CES 2026 companies building edge businesses -> MOD goes up. Autonomous driving/robotics continues to grow -> MOD goes up. There is a reason they split the Auto OEM off - it's low growth. MOD is now a high growth company focusing on cooling products that are generating insane amounts of heat. There are competitors, but the demand is insatiable and their backlog expands 18 months! Earnings are on the 4th of next week. Buckle up!",

Read everything I wrote in that post it will all happen . Heres how itll play out MSFT and Meta will continue spending on capex MOD goes up . CES 2026 companies building edge businesses MOD goes up . Autonomous drivingrobotics continues to grow MOD goes up . There is a reason they split the Auto OEM off its low growth .

      "selftext": "META reported solid Q4 2025 results yesterday: EPS of ($8.88 vs $8.19 expected), revenue of $59.9 billion (above expectations), and particularly strong Q1 2026 guidance (projected revenue of $53.5-56.5 billion, well above the consensus around $51 billion). The most noteworthy point: capex planned for 2026 is between $115 and $135 billion, a very significant increase from $72 billion in 2025. The market reacted positively (the stock is up about +9-10% today, trading around $730-735), while Microsoft, delivering a similar message on AI investments, is down more than 10%. This divergence is interesting. On one hand, investors appear to be endorsing Meta’s strategy: strong advertising monetization thanks to real AI optimization, exploding DAUs, and a perceived closer and more tangible return on investment compared to some peers. On the other hand, a capex of this magnitude legitimately raises questions about risks: potential overcapacity in data centers, delays in generating incremental cash flows, or increased sensitivity to a macroeconomic slowdown. I’m neither compulsively selling nor buying here, but this level of euphoria around such massive spending makes me cautious. Historically, when the market heavily rewards large-scale investment spending without demanding immediate proof of profitability, it can sometimes precede later re-evaluations. Apart from that, January 2026 is shaping up to be a triple-threat market moment: * Risk of a government shutdown, * Precious metals breaking all-time historical levels, * And major Big Tech earnings colliding in the same narrow window. **Why the market is reacting this way** Political uncertainty has weakened the dollar and driven investors toward assets that aren't dependent on government stability. That's why gold and silver are smashing through historical highs (gold recently trading around $5,070–$5,268/oz as of late January 2026, amid ongoing partial shutdown risks with funding deadlines around January 30–31). At the same time, tech is under pressure as capital shifts away from pure growth plays toward AI infrastructure. Software is getting cheaper to scale, but the hardware powering AI is becoming more expensive, forcing a re-evaluation of valuations. That's why I still find Bitget Stock Futures particularly interesting this week (easy long and short exposure, leverage to improve capital efficiency). How do you read this situation? * Are you increasing your exposure to META following this momentum and guidance? * Are you trimming or staying neutral, waiting for more visibility on the ROI of these AI investments? * Or are you simply observing the divergence with the other Big Tech names? I’m curious about your takes, especially on how you assess the sustainability of this capex level in the current context (interest rates, ad growth, competition). Let’s discuss calmly and factually.",

      "selftext_processed": "META reported solid Q4 2025 results yesterday EPS of $ 8.88 vs $ 8.19 expected revenue of $ 59.9 billion above expectations and particularly strong Q1 2026 guidance projected revenue of $ 53.556.5 billion well above the consensus around $ 51 billion . The most noteworthy point capex planned for 2026 is between $ 115 and $ 135 billion a very significant increase from $ 72 billion in 2025 . The market reacted positively the stock is up about 910 % today trading around $ 730735 while Microsoft delivering a similar message on AI investments is down more than 10 % . This divergence is interesting . On one hand investors appear to be endorsing Meta ’ s strategy strong advertising monetization thanks to real AI optimization exploding DAUs and a perceived closer and more tangible return on investment compared to some peers . On the other hand a capex of this magnitude legitimately raises questions about risks potential overcapacity in data centers delays in generating incremental cash flows or increased sensitivity to a macroeconomic slowdown . I ’ m neither_compulsively selling nor buying here but this level of euphoria around such massive spending makes me cautious . Historically when the market heavily rewards largescale investment spending without demanding immediate proof of profitability it can sometimes precede later reevaluations . Apart from that January 2026 is shaping up to be a triplethreat market moment Risk of a government shutdown Precious metals breaking alltime historical levels And major Big Tech earnings colliding in the same narrow window . Why the market is reacting this way Political uncertainty has weakened the dollar and driven investors toward assets that arent dependent on government stability . Thats why gold and silver are smashing through historical highs gold recently trading around $ 5070– $ 5268oz as of late January 2026 amid ongoing partial shutdown risks with funding deadlines around January 30–31 . At the same time tech is under pressure as capital shifts away from pure growth plays toward AI infrastructure . Software is getting cheaper to scale but the hardware powering AI is becoming more expensive forcing a reevaluation of valuations . Thats why I still find Bitget Stock Futures particularly interesting this week easy long and short exposure leverage to improve capital efficiency . How do you read this situation Are you increasing your exposure to META following this momentum and guidance Are you trimming or staying neutral waiting for more visibility on the ROI of these AI investments Or are you simply observing the divergence with the other Big Tech names I ’ m curious about your takes especially on how you assess the sustainability of this capex level in the current context interest rates ad growth competition . Let ’ s discuss calmly and factually ."

      "selftext": "I know where I’m posting. This is r/investing, not r wishfulthinking. The point here is not to spray tickers. It is to show a disciplined way to mine hated small caps for asymmetric risk when the story improves while the chart still looks like a crime scene. If that sentence makes you roll your eyes, fair. If you are open to a process, read on. # The framework in one minute Price is the last thing I respect, not the first. I start with operating signals that change future cash flow: mix shift to products, margin inflection, real contracts, dated clinical readouts, credible partners. I avoid narrative pivots and look for receipts. LOIs and \"strategic reviews\" do not count. Bind it to a filing, a signed customer, a funded order, or a trial that is actually enrolling. I want a believable catalyst ladder. The next 90 to 270 days should have events you can calendar. Without that, it is a trade, not an investment. Balance sheet sanity matters. I will tolerate losses if runway is real and raises are likely to be structured, not panic. Sizing is small, review windows are short. These are special situations inside a broader portfolio, not core holdings. Below are names that fit the ugly chart, improving story profile. This is a watchlist with reasons, not a buy list. # CELU: revenue now, pipeline later Cell therapy with real revenue and gross profit, deep losses, and a chart nobody wants. If a pipeline milestone lands or a partner funds the next gate, losses can compress faster than the market expects because gross profit already exists. Drift and dilution without progress is your exit. # GNSS: contract driven rerate potential Public safety and emergency communications. Revenue is growing, earnings are negative, and the tape is tired. Municipal and federal awards change the P&L and the narrative. Book a multi-year system rollout and the multiple stops looking like punishment. No awards, no interest. # NXXT: execution on throughput, watch for mix, most hate Energy and on-site power services with a battered chart. The company is pacing record quarterly fuel volumes, which proves operations and route density. The rerate only happens if mix shifts toward power, storage, charging, and service SLAs. What would change my view: a filed contract that converts a fuel customer into a microgrid or storage site, plus disclosure of attach rates. What would kill it: more volume with flat per gallon gross profit and no progress on contracted services. # ACCL: numbers say improve, chart says ignore Small cap with positive revenue and EBITDA, modest profits, and indifference on the tape. If operating improvement persists for two more quarters with clean working capital, the mismatch between income statement and price is the edge. If margins slip, the idea dies. # CCCC: partner optionality in a hated sector Targeted protein degradation with collaboration revenue and heavy R&D. The whole space is out of favor. A partner milestone or a move from preclinical to clinical in a high value target is the switch. Without dated milestones and external cash, it stays a tourist trap. # RIME: distressed growth that needs customer proof AI logistics with rapid ARR talk and a deflated price. This belongs on the list only if customer adds, retention, and cash collection start showing up in filings. A dated enterprise contract or two with implementation milestones would move it out of story land. If the next print is more burn with hand-wavy pipeline, pass. # LEDS: margin inflection or nothing LED manufacturer with strong revenue growth and persistent losses. This is a gross margin story. Two consecutive quarters of margin improvement with stable opex and you have a case. Otherwise it remains a lesson in how revenue without unit economics solves nothing. # BTAI: binary late stage, sized accordingly Late stage biotech with a chart that suggests witness protection. If the next clinical gate clears, you will not be buying it down here later. If not, zero is a number. This is position sizing, not faith. # MYO: adoption curve patience Rehab robotics with decent growth and a long drawdown. Watch payer wins and unit velocity, not message boards. If reimbursement widens and units accelerate, the chart will follow. If not, park it. # Risk management so this stays investing, not gambling These are all small caps with real drawdown risk. Position sizes should be trivial relative to core holdings. Treat each thesis like a credit and define the covenant that would make you exit. For NXXT it is attach rates and contracted power progress. For RIME it is signed enterprise customers and cash collection. For CELU it is pipeline advancement funded by partners. For GNSS it is award cadence. If the covenant breaks, you sell. No averaging down to prove a point. # Why bother at all Because the market’s memory is short and its fear lasts longer than it should. The best time to underwrite a turnaround is when the operating line turns before the chart. That gap is where excess return comes from. If you demand uptrends first, you can still win, you just pay more. If you made it this far, poke holes in the framework or add your own loser with receipts. If your first instinct is \"pennies are trash,\" I agree often. That is why process beats vibes Hope you found this useful or, at least, entertaining. Peace.",

      "selftext_processed": "I know where I ’ m posting . This is rinvesting not_r wishfulthinking . The point here is not_to spray tickers . It is to show a disciplined way to mine hated small caps for asymmetric risk when the story improves while the chart still looks like a crime scene . If that sentence makes you roll your eyes fair . If you are open to a process read on . The framework in one minute Price is the last thing I respect not_the first . I start with operating signals that change future cash flow mix shift to products margin inflection real contracts dated clinical readouts credible partners . I avoid narrative pivots and look for receipts . LOIs and strategic reviews do not_count . Bind it to a filing a signed customer a funded order or a trial that is actually enrolling . I want a believable catalyst ladder . The next 90 to 270 days should have events you can calendar . Without that it is a trade not_an investment . Balance sheet sanity matters . I will tolerate losses if runway is real and raises are likely to be structured not_panic . Sizing is small review windows are short . These are special situations inside a broader portfolio not_core holdings . Below are names that fit the ugly chart improving story profile . This is a watchlist with reasons not_a buy list . CELU revenue now pipeline later Cell therapy with real revenue and gross profit deep losses and a chart nobody_wants . If a pipeline milestone lands or a partner funds the next gate losses can compress faster than the market expects because gross profit already exists . Drift and dilution without progress is your exit . GNSS contract driven rerate potential Public safety and emergency communications . Revenue is growing earnings are negative and the tape is tired . Municipal and federal awards change the PL and the narrative . Book a multiyear system rollout and the multiple stops looking like punishment . No_awards no_interest . NXXT execution on throughput watch for mix most hate Energy and onsite power services with a battered chart . The company is pacing record quarterly fuel volumes which proves operations and route density . The rerate only happens if mix shifts toward power storage charging and service SLAs . What would change my view a filed contract that converts a fuel customer into a microgrid or storage site plus disclosure of attach rates . What would kill it more volume with flat per gallon gross profit and no_progress on contracted services . ACCL numbers say improve chart says ignore Small cap with positive revenue and EBITDA modest profits and indifference on the tape . If operating improvement persists for two more quarters with clean working capital the mismatch between income statement and price is the edge . If margins slip the idea dies . CCCC partner optionality in a hated sector Targeted protein degradation with collaboration revenue and heavy RD . The whole space is out of favor . A partner milestone or a move from preclinical to clinical in a high value target is the switch . Without dated milestones and external cash it stays a tourist trap . RIME distressed growth that needs customer proof AI logistics with rapid ARR talk and a deflated price . This belongs on the list only if customer adds retention and cash collection start showing up in filings . A dated enterprise contract or two with implementation milestones would move it out of story land . If the next print is more burn with handwavy pipeline pass . LEDS margin inflection or nothing_LED manufacturer with strong revenue growth and persistent losses . This is a gross margin story . Two consecutive quarters of margin improvement with stable opex and you have a case . Otherwise it remains a lesson in how revenue without unit economics solves nothing_ BTAI binary late stage sized accordingly Late stage biotech with a chart that suggests witness protection . If the next clinical gate clears you will not_be buying it down here later . If not_zero is a number . This is position sizing not_faith . MYO adoption curve patience Rehab robotics with decent growth and a long drawdown . Watch payer wins and unit velocity not_message boards . If reimbursement widens and units accelerate the chart will follow . If not_park it . Risk management so this stays investing not_gambling These are all small caps with real drawdown risk . Position sizes should be trivial relative to core holdings . Treat each thesis like a credit and define the covenant that would make you exit . For NXXT it is attach rates and contracted power progress . For RIME it is signed enterprise customers and cash collection . For CELU it is pipeline advancement funded by partners . For GNSS it is award cadence . If the covenant breaks you sell . No_averaging down to prove a point . Why bother at all Because the market ’ s memory is short and its fear lasts longer than it should . The best time to underwrite a turnaround is when the operating line turns before the chart . That gap is where excess return comes from . If you demand uptrends first you can still win you just pay more . If you made it this far poke holes in the framework or add your own loser with receipts . If your first instinct is pennies are trash I agree often . That is why process beats vibes Hope you found this useful or at least entertaining . Peace ."

Before you call me a regard, I already know I am (so are you so shut up), and I already know that this stock runs purely on vibes... But in a world where Elon can helicopter his little ween around stage and pump Tesla on the promise of sexbots and trash xAI, why can't Peter Thiel do the same thing? Especially when the stock is DOWN 3% over the past 6 months... PLTR is as polarizing as AI gets in the United States, and all it takes is one ridiculous announcement for it to go boom boom... Don't tell me we don't get those daily for the last couple months. Not only are they the premier AI for the military, but PLTR is driving profitability insights for some of the biggest companies and health systems in the country. This announcement can come from the man upstairs, and/or during earnings - it literally doesn't matter. It's time to cycle some money back towards the bad guys. If there's one thing I've learned over the past year, it's to bet on the rich guys. Clearly NFA. I'm not rich, handsome, or smart... But I'm not dim enough for options. 30k in shares below.",

But in a world where Elon can helicopter his little ween around stage and pump Tesla on the promise of sexbots and trash xAI why cant Peter Thiel do the same thing Especially when the stock is DOWN 3 % over the past 6 months ... PLTR is as polarizing as AI gets in the United States and all it takes is one ridiculous announcement for it to go boom boom ... Dont tell me we dont get those daily for the last couple months . Not_only are they the premier AI for the military but PLTR is driving profitability insights for some of the biggest companies and health systems in the country . This announcement can come from the man upstairs andor during earnings it literally doesnt matter . Its time to cycle some money back towards the bad guys . If theres one thing Ive learned over the past year its to bet on the rich guys . Clearly NFA . Im not_rich handsome or smart ... But Im not_dim enough for options . 30k in shares below ."

I had $30 in WS physical gold but don’t care too much about the physical aspect to be honest. By the sounds of it ETF might be better suited for me. I’m not sure whether I am low or high risk. I plan to hold for a while but I’ve never been good at planning 20-30 years ahead. Not sure what my best route is. I see a lot about getting ZGLD, CGL, kilo.b, kilo.u, kilo, hygh? cgl.c, hgy Idk if I’m just confusing myself at this point. Any insight is greatly appreciated, thanks!

I had $ 30 in WS physical gold but don ’ t care too much about the physical aspect to be honest . By the sounds of it ETF might be better suited for me . I ’ m not_sure whether I am low or high risk . I plan to hold for a while but I ’ ve never_been good at planning 2030 years ahead . Not_sure what my best route is . I see a lot about getting ZGLD CGL kilo.b kilo.u kilo hygh cgl.c hgy Idk if I ’ m just confusing myself at this point . Any insight is greatly appreciated thanks I tried posting in rcanadianinvestor but got auto taken down for account age trying my luck here"

During the previous drawdown, the dominant narrative was that META’s core business was permanently impaired. Valuation compression, heavy capex concerns, and layoffs made it an easy stock to dismiss. That period, however, is where the risk-reward profile quietly flipped. From the lows, the stock went on to deliver a 7x move. What stood out to me wasn’t prediction accuracy, but structure: Revenues stabilized before sentiment improved Cost discipline showed up in margins before headlines changed Liquidity returned long before retail interest did Tracking equities alongside broader market instruments helped frame META less as a “story stock” and more as a mean-reversion + execution case. That’s also why I’ve been following environments like stock futures trading not for promotion, but because derivatives often reflect positioning and sentiment shifts earlier than spot discussions do. Disclosure: I previously held a long position in META during part of this recovery and currently hold no open META position. Main takeaway Crowd narratives tend to peak after the asymmetric opportunity has passed. Structure, liquidity, and fundamentals usually turn first.",

What I gathered, the $975M deal was paid in stock = 75,000,000 new ANPA shares to the sellers which is roughly $13 a share. If they really issue 75M new shares (vs \\~12.5M outstanding, ish), doesn't that basically destroy the scarcity and force the price to re-anchor closer to the $13ish deal valuation? Like post, deal you're at \\~87.5M shares, so even a \\~$1B valuation is like $11/$13 a share not $60/$100/$180. And... $975M for an influencer operating company sounds totally crazy if there isn't any real revenue/EBITDA that supports it. Does anyone have the actual numbers for Step Distinctive / Khabys business? Any comparable deals where an influencer brand was valued anywhere close to this? What am I missing?",

If they really issue 75M new shares vs 12.5M outstanding ish doesnt that basically destroy the scarcity and force the price to reanchor closer to the $ 13ish deal valuation Like post deal youre at 87.5M shares so even a $ 1B valuation is like $ 11 $ 13 a share not_ $ 60 $ 100 $ 180 . And ... $ 975M for an influencer operating company sounds totally crazy if there isnt any real revenueEBITDA that supports it . Does anyone have the actual numbers for Step Distinctive Khabys business Any comparable deals where an influencer brand was valued anywhere close to this What am I missing"

      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over extended periods, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing, drawdown deployment, or reduced forced selling during market stress. While this approach may lower expected returns, it could potentially improve risk-adjusted outcomes depending on how it is implemented. From a structural perspective, this raises a broader question: should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management, or simply an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? For those focused on long horizons, how do you think about this tradeoff in practice? Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework, or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested.?",

I can't be the only Boglehead that has a spreadsheet of the most recent underlying holdings of the vanguard ETFs I own, with the weights for each stock. I wanted to know if maybe I'm just crazy or if this is something that others also have an interest in? Additionally, does anyone else wish they could see the individual dividends of the underlying holdings get paid, even in accumulating funds, ie not actually have the cash paid into my account, but have my Vanguard Brokerage account tell me that with my number of ETF units I 'earned $X.xx in dividends today from Apple' even though it stayed within the accumulation fund and I never actually saw the cash?",

Its much more interesting to think about how I theoretically have a clam on XY company and look up their financials than just see a number of Vanguard Units in my brokerage . I cant be the only Boglehead that has a spreadsheet of the most recent underlying holdings of the vanguard ETFs I own with the weights for each stock . I wanted to know if maybe Im just crazy or if this is something that others also have an interest in Additionally does anyone else wish they could see the individual dividends of the underlying holdings get paid even in accumulating funds ie not_actually have the cash paid into my account but have my Vanguard Brokerage account tell me that with my number of ETF units I earned $ X.xx in dividends today from Apple even though it stayed within the accumulation fund and I never_actually saw the cash"

We're executing and winning with programs like the Apple Card and robust growth in value-added services and solutions at 23%, or 21% currency-neutral. The overall macroeconomic environment is supportive and we continue to see healthy consumer and business spending. That, together with trusted technology, constant innovation, and deep partnerships, powers our performance. Focused, agile, and diversified, we’re well positioned for the opportunities ahead in 2026.” Mastercard’s Value-Added Services continues to be a compounding machine for the company. It’s interesting to see the company diversify itself away from just being a payment network provider.",

You guys are looking at the charts but you aren't seeing the **PHYSICS**. Look at the market right now. **Semiconductors** (NVDA, AMD, TSM)? TO THE MOON. They are the BRAINS. The logic gates. The thinking rocks we tricked into doing math. Look at **Metals/Conductors** (Copper, Gold, Silver)? RIPPING. We are digging shiny rocks out of the ground like dwarves on meth. This is the BLOOD. The flow. The path of least resistance. But you smooth-brained degenerates are missing the third leg of the Holy Trinity of Electricity. The market is currently an **OPEN CIRCUIT**. The money is leaking out into the atmosphere because *there is no insulation.* **THE THESIS: THE GREAT INSULATOR SUPER-CYCLE (GISC)** Electricity 101: If you have a conductor (Copper) and a Semiconductor (Nvidia), and you pump infinite voltage (J-Pow's money printer) into it without insulation, WHAT HAPPENS? **SHORT CIRCUIT.** THE SYSTEM FRIES. We need **RESISTANCE.** We need to stop the current from grounding out so we can trap the energy (tendies) inside the portfolio forever. **THE PLAY: ISOLATOR STOCKS** I am talking about the boring, dusty companies that make the pink stuff in your walls and the ceramic disks on power lines. 1. **Owens Corning (OC):** They make fiberglass. PINK FIBERGLASS. It’s basically cotton candy that makes you itch and stops money from leaving your house. 2. **Hubbell (HUBB):** They make electrical insulators. If the grid doesn't have these, the AI revolution burns down the forest. No insulators = No AI. NVDA goes to zero without HUBB. MATH. 3. **Rockwool (ROCK-B):** IT IS LITERAL WOOL MADE OF ROCKS. How is this not trading at 5,000x PE? It is fireproof. It is idiot-proof. It is the skin of the beast. **THE SINGULARITY** Once we pump the Isolators, we complete the **Global Circuit**. * **Semiconductors** generate the signal. * **Conductors** carry the signal. * **Isolators** contain the signal. When the trifecta is complete, the velocity of money hits zero because it cannot escape the loop. We achieve **Superconducting Financial Singularity.** The stock market becomes a perpetual motion machine. We will literally transcend fiat currency and start trading in pure joules of energy. **TL;DR:** NVDA is the brain. Copper is the veins. **INSULATION IS THE SKIN.** Right now the market is a flayed man running down the street screaming. BUY THE SKIN. BUY THE PINK STUFF.

      "selftext": "NFE is a US based company doing a UK restructuring. That almost never happens. I tried to find another public US stock that did something similar. The closest one I found was Fossil Group $FOSL. Fossil did a UK restructuring in November 2025. After that the stock went from around $1.9 to about $4. There was no squeeze setup there. Short interest was only around 13 percent. Borrow fee was roughly 10 to 15 percent. Float was not tight. $NFE is very different. Short interest is around 30 to 40 percent depending on the source. Borrow fee is already close to 100 percent. Looking at the options chain most of the short position does not look hedged. There is not much call coverage. If price moves up they have to buy stock. Also the float is locked 90% by insiders and institutions. Most people who shorted $NFE did it with one assumption. Chapter 11. Equity wipeout. UK restructuring is not that. It is a different legal path. Different incentives. Different timeline. Equity does not automatically go to zero. Preferred equity will be issued but that does not immediately dilute the stock, meaning shorts are caught in a squeeze Because of that the original short thesis breaks. Shorts are now stuck holding a position that is expensive to maintain and hard to exit if volume comes in. Fossil doubled with weak short interest and low borrow. $NFE has much higher short interest and much higher borrow.",

Short interest was only around 13 percent . Borrow fee was roughly 10 to 15 percent . Float was not_tight . $ NFE is very different . Short interest is around 30 to 40 percent depending on the source . Borrow fee is already close to 100 percent . Looking at the options chain most of the short position does not_look hedged . There is not_much call coverage . If price moves up they have to buy stock . Also the float is locked 90 % by insiders and institutions . Most people who shorted $ NFE did it with one assumption . Chapter 11 . Equity wipeout . UK restructuring is not_that . It is a different legal path . Different incentives . Different timeline . Equity does not_automatically go to zero . Preferred equity will be issued but that does not_immediately dilute the stock meaning shorts are caught in a squeeze Because of that the original short thesis breaks . Shorts are now stuck holding a position that is expensive to maintain and hard to exit if volume comes in . Fossil doubled with weak short interest and low borrow . $ NFE has much higher short interest and much higher borrow ."

      "selftext": "Hi, I hold PSLV to get exposure to the silver price. I've heard that PSLV is safer than SLV because it's backed 100% by physical silver bars in the Royal Canadian vault while SLV only has 70% backed by physical bars, the rest is in paper claim exposure. So, I have all of my silver exposure in this one stock PSLV. I would like to diversify a bit. Are there any other safe equity alternatives that would give the exposure to the silver price? Also how safe is PSLV? Do they have audit to verify that they actually have 100% allocated silver bars to back all shares that they issued? Please advise. Thank you.",

Ive heard that PSLV is safer than SLV because its backed 100 % by physical silver bars in the Royal Canadian vault while SLV only has 70 % backed by physical bars the rest is in paper claim exposure . So I have all of my silver exposure in this one stock PSLV . I would like to diversify a bit . Are there any other safe equity alternatives that would give the exposure to the silver price Also how safe is PSLV Do they have audit to verify that they actually have 100 % allocated silver bars to back all shares that they issued Please advise . Thank you ."

      "selftext": "The common narrative on this sub is: *\"Nvidia is too expensive, so I’ll buy AMD as the value play.\"* It makes intuitive sense. NVDA is at all-time highs, and everyone loves an underdog. But \"intuition\" loses money. I ran the numbers through my valuation models (blending VC-style projections, DCF, and Analyst Consensus), and the math actually proves the opposite. **The Reality: NVDA is the one trading at \"Fair Value.\" AMD is the one trading at a massive premium.** Here is the breakdown of the Title Fight. **Contender 1: The Challenger (AMD)** * **Current Price:** \\~$252 * **Intrinsic Value:** \\~$232 - $245 * **The Verdict:** **Overvalued (Wait)** **The Problem:** AMD is being priced for a future that hasn't happened yet. The 5-Star Analysts (Piper, UBS) have targets of $300+ because they are betting on a massive \"Nvidia Moment\" with the MI300 chips. But when you run the actual math (DCF/PEG) based on *current* cash flow, the fair value is closer to **$232**. **The Silent Killer:** **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital).** Nobody talks about this, but look at the spread: * **AMD ROIC:** \\~4.1% * **Cost of Capital (WACC):** \\~9.5% Right now, AMD is technically destroying value to build its infrastructure. They are spending billions to catch up, but the cash flow isn't there yet. **The Risk:** Earnings are on **Feb 3 (Monday)**. This is a binary event. If they guide weak, or if that ROIC doesn't tick up, the drop to the $225 support level will be fast. **Contender 2: The King (NVDA)** * **Current Price:** \\~$191.50 * **Intrinsic Value:** \\~$189 * **The Verdict:** **Fair Value (Hold/Accumulate)** **The Paradox:** It sounds crazy to call a $3 Trillion company \"cheap,\" but Nvidia defies the laws of capitalism. * **PEG Ratio:** 0.77 (Anything under 1.0 is considered \"Cheap\" for growth). * **ROIC:** **90.9%**. (Read that again. For every $1 they invest, they get $1.90 back). My blended model puts NVDA’s value around **$189**. At $191, you are paying exactly what the business is worth. You aren't getting a discount, but you aren't paying a \"hype premium\" either. You are buying a monopoly at fair market value. **The Final Verdict** I know everyone wants to find the \"Next Nvidia,\" but the math suggests the best play is still just... Nvidia. 1. **NVDA:** **Hold.** If it dips to **$165 - $170**, buy aggressively. You are buying a 90% ROIC machine at a discount. 2. **AMD:** **Wait.** The \"Buy Zone\" is **$220 - $225**. Do not chase it at $252 right before earnings. Let the Feb 3 report confirm the execution before you risk your capital. *Disclaimer: Not financial advice. Just a guy with a spreadsheet.*",

      "selftext_processed": "The common narrative on this sub is Nvidia is too expensive so I ’ ll buy AMD as the value play . It makes intuitive sense . NVDA is at alltime highs and everyone loves an underdog . But intuition loses money . I ran the numbers through my valuation models blending VCstyle projections DCF and Analyst Consensus and the math actually proves the opposite . The Reality NVDA is the one trading at Fair Value . AMD is the one trading at a massive premium . Here is the breakdown of the Title Fight . Contender 1 The Challenger AMD Current Price $ 252 Intrinsic Value $ 232 $ 245 The Verdict Overvalued Wait The Problem AMD is being priced for a future that hasnt happened yet . The 5Star Analysts Piper UBS have targets of $ 300 because they are betting on a massive Nvidia Moment with the MI300 chips . But when you run the actual math DCFPEG based on current cash flow the fair value is closer to $ 232 . The Silent Killer ROIC Return on Invested Capital . Nobody_talks about this but look at the spread AMD ROIC 4.1 % Cost of Capital WACC 9.5 % Right now AMD is technically destroying value to build its infrastructure . They are spending billions to catch up but the cash flow isnt there yet . The Risk Earnings are on Feb 3 Monday . This is a binary event . If they guide weak or if that ROIC doesnt tick up the drop to the $ 225 support level will be fast . Contender 2 The King NVDA Current Price $ 191.50 Intrinsic Value $ 189 The Verdict Fair Value HoldAccumulate The Paradox It sounds crazy to call a $ 3 Trillion company cheap but Nvidia defies the laws of capitalism . PEG Ratio 0.77 Anything under 1.0 is considered Cheap for growth . ROIC 90.9 % . Read that again . For every $ 1 they invest they get $ 1.90 back . My blended model puts NVDA ’ s value around $ 189 . At $ 191 you are paying exactly what the business is worth . You arent getting a discount but you arent paying a hype premium either . You are buying a monopoly at fair market value . The Final Verdict I know everyone wants to find the Next Nvidia but the math suggests the best play is still just ... Nvidia . 1 . NVDA Hold . If it dips to $ 165 $ 170 buy aggressively . You are buying a 90 % ROIC machine at a discount . 2 . AMD Wait . The Buy Zone is $ 220 $ 225 . Do not_chase it at $ 252 right before earnings . Let the Feb 3 report confirm the execution before you risk your capital . Disclaimer Not_financial advice . Just a guy with a spreadsheet ."

      "title": "Why Abu Dhabi? (And why investors are now choosing it over Dubai)",
      "selftext": "LONG READ WARNING! :) Hello everyone, as a property investment consultant & broker in the UAE, lately, a lot of my clients have been foreign investors looking for property in Dubai and many are surprised when i steer them towards Abu Dhabi instead of the more familiar Dubai Market. I decided to put together this post for anyone who has been curious or thinking about investing in real estate in the UAE, but isn't sure where to start, which areas are worth considering or which city might be a safer bet. I'll give you some insight on the Abu Dhabi Market & explain the best areas to invest in. To give you a little background information, Now is the best time for real estate investments in the capital, Abu Dhabi. The Abu Dhabi real estate market has really only opened up full freehold ownership to foreign investors around 6ish years ago (Dubai has been offering this since 2002, for comparison). In the first half of 2025, there were only 4000 new off-plan units launched in Abu Dhabi, whereas in the same time frame, there were about 65,000 launched in Dubai. Abu Dhabi's population is currently growing much faster than Dubai's (twice as much in the last year), and continues to grow rapidly, so the rental demand & yield in Abu Dhabi is higher due to the shortage. Residential Projects from the top developers sell out in less than 24 hours & experienced investors understand the value of Abu Dhabi's real estate market. In H1 2025 the property transaction value in AD was 14.1B USD (+39% YoY). \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ The key areas in Abu Dhabi investors should be looking at: • Yas Island • Saadiyat Island • Al Reem Island Newer off-plan developments but with very high potential: • Fahid Island • Ramhan Island • Hudairiyat Island \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ The Best Developers in Abu Dhabi IMO: \\- ALDAR (They lead the market & have a huge role in the development of Abu Dhabi. Any project they launch is almost instantly sold out & Aldar properties hold their value very well) \\- SOBHA \\- MODON \\- SAAS Properties \\- Bloom Holding \\- OBJECT 1 \\- ICT \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ DEVELOPER PAYMENT PLANS IN ABU DHABI: For reference, when you buy off-plan property directly from a developer in the UAE, whether you're a resident or a foreign investor, you have the option to go with a \"payment plan\" which will usually look something like this \"60/40 10% down\" or \"65/35 5% down\" and there are a lot of different options. The breakdown goes as follows: For 60/40 - 10% down: 10% of property price is paid as a down payment along with 2% govt fees 50% is paid in 4-6 installments over the course of (usually) 3 years while the property is under development 40% is paid once the project is completed & your unit is handed over to you Two very common strategies here are the \"Early stage flip\" & \"Pre-handover exit\" Early stage flip: Investors get a unit at launch with a relatively low down payment, 5% or 10% in projects that are expected to sell out rapidly due to strong demand and limited supply (because not all interested buyers are able to secure a unit they want) and units often trade at a premium shortly after launch. Basically before the next installment is due (usually around 6 months from purchase), investors resell the contract at a premium, typically in the range of $50,000-$150,000, depending on the project. Pre-handover edit: investors continue paying installments over the construction period. By the time the project nears completion and the handover payment is nearly due, market value has often appreciated significantly, especially when the asset is from a top developer & in a strong location. So for example, a unit purchased at $460K may be valued at around $730K-$820K before handover, allowing the investor to exit prior to the handover and realize capital appreciation without holding long term. Of course for investors who are willing to hold longer term, capital appreciation can be a lot higher, especially in prime locations. The strategies i mentioned above are typically used by investors who prefer shorter holding periods and faster capital recycling. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Now let's expand on the areas i mentioned earlier, 1. YAS ISLAND: \\- Entertainment + Tourism Hub (Beaches, Golf, Theme parks, Nightlife, Sports, Concerts, MMA, F1, etc.) \\- Also the location of the upcoming 2030 DISNEYLAND Abu Dhabi. (This is important because it will further boost tourism & demand in the area and drive property value up.) Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 6.5-8.5% • Villa Value Growth approx. 12-18% YoY • Apartment Value Growth approx. 8-11% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $300K-$400K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $400K-$500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $500K-$800K • Villas & Townhouses - $1.3M-$4m+ 2. SAADIYAT ISLAND (my personal favorite): \\- Lifestyle, Cultural District & Luxury: \\- Investing in property in Saadiyat is widely thought of as one of the strongest long-term real estate investments in the UAE. The island consistently shows high demand from local and international buyers, supported by limited supply & prestige branding. Saadiyat is also a magnet for HNWI. Property value in Saadiyat has doubled over the last few years. The Island is Abu Dhabi's art & cultural district & has museums such as the Louvre, the Guggenheim, The national history museum & Sheikh Zayed museum. Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 5.5-7.5% • Villa Value Growth approx. 15-28% YoY (one of the highest in the UAE) • Apartment Value Growth approx. 10-15% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $300K-$600K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $700K-$1.4M+ • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $1.5M+ • Villas & Townhouses - $3M+ 3. AL REEM ISLAND: \\- More affordable than Saadiyat & Yas island but still very popular. A great community that's popular with younger professionals and expats. Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 6-9% • Apartment Value Growth approx. 7-12% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $150K-$250K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $250K-$500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $500K-$750K • 3 Bedroom Apartments - $750K-$1.2M • 4+ Bedroom Villas - $1.7M-$2.5M+ 4. HUDAIRIYAT ISLAND \\- A sports & lifestyle hub. Mostly beachfront living, with a focus on sports & wellness. Hudairiyat is REALLY in demand right now. All the projects launched there are selling out instantly. For example, the most recent one was \"Bashayer\" by MODON. It sold out in 1 day, generating 3 Billion AED in sales. Typical Prices: • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $650K-$750K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $850K-$1.1M • 3+ Bedroom Villas - $1.2M-$2.5M 5. FAHID ISLAND \\- Fahid Island is developed by Aldar & is a wellness-focused island positioned between Yas Island & Saadiyat Island & one of the most anticipated master-planned developments in Abu Dhabi. Its designed around low-density living, walkability, greenery, beaches and curated community facilities & Its attracting strong investor & end user interest mostly because of Aldars reputation & the islands strategic location. Typical Prices: • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $650K-$800K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $850K-$1.1M • 3 Bedroom Apartments - $1.2M-$2M 5. RAMHAN ISLAND \\- Ramhan is a luxury natural island project developed by Eagle Hills, focusing on private waterfront villas, private beaches & resort-style living. It has VERY limited supply which makes it one of Abu Dhabi's most exclusive residential projects. The island only has villas and each phase of the project only releases a small number of units so investors & end users are attracted by the islands scarcity value, privacy and long term capital appreciation potential. Ramhan is especially appealing to HNW buyers who are looking for a more private island lifestyle that's still close to the city. Typical Prices: • 3-7 Bedroom Villas - $2.5M - $10M Personally, I really believe in Saadiyat Island, Yas Island & Hudairiyat as long-term investments. I purchased off-plan property in Saadiyat myself last year & hope to invest in another project there soon as well. Given the market history, the governments investments & support in developing the areas, and the very limited space left to build, i just feel like options on these islands are becoming increasingly scarce. The scarcity combined with their prime locations, makes them some of the best investments in the UAE right now. To give you an idea, The off-plan property i purchased from the developer last Aug for $1M (I've only paid the 5% down payment + 2% + first installment so far, in total about $120k), I could already sell for a $70k-$85k profit today if i went for an early exit strat. If you'd like to do a bit of research yourself, look at the developer launch prices of projects in Saadiyat Island, for example, from last year like \"Mamsha Gardens\" & \"The Row\", then look at the current resale prices they're listed at on platforms like propertyfinder.ae or BAYUT. This will give you an idea of how fast off-plan property value appreciates in an area like Saadiyat. Since i'm mostly explaining off-plan investments here and also since theres of course, a lot more information about off-plan, the secondary market & UAE real estate in general, for anyone that has more questions or wants to discuss further, feel free to ask & I'm happy to answer!",

      "selftext_processed": "LONG READ WARNING Hello everyone as a property investment consultant broker in the UAE lately a lot of my clients have been foreign investors looking for property in Dubai and many are surprised when i steer them towards Abu Dhabi instead of the more familiar Dubai Market . I decided to put together this post for anyone who has been curious or thinking about investing in real estate in the UAE but isnt sure where to start which areas are worth considering or which city might be a safer bet . Ill give you some insight on the Abu Dhabi Market explain the best areas to invest in . To give you a little background information Now is the best time for real estate investments in the capital Abu Dhabi . The Abu Dhabi real estate market has really only opened up full freehold ownership to foreign investors around 6ish years ago Dubai has been offering this since 2002 for comparison . In the first half of 2025 there were only 4000 new offplan units launched in Abu Dhabi whereas in the same time frame there were about 65000 launched in Dubai . Abu Dhabis population is currently growing much faster than Dubais twice as much in the last year and continues to grow rapidly so the rental demand yield in Abu Dhabi is higher due to the shortage . Residential Projects from the top developers sell out in less than 24 hours experienced investors understand the value of Abu Dhabis real estate market . In H1 2025 the property transaction value in AD was 14.1B USD 39 % YoY . _____ The key areas in Abu Dhabi investors should be looking at • Yas Island • Saadiyat Island • Al Reem Island Newer offplan developments but with very high potential • Fahid Island • Ramhan Island • Hudairiyat Island _____ The Best Developers in Abu Dhabi IMO ALDAR They lead the market have a huge role in the development of Abu Dhabi . Any project they launch is almost instantly sold out Aldar properties hold their value very well SOBHA MODON SAAS Properties Bloom Holding OBJECT 1 ICT _____ DEVELOPER PAYMENT PLANS IN ABU DHABI For reference when you buy offplan property directly from a developer in the UAE whether youre a resident or a foreign investor you have the option to go with a payment plan which will usually look something like this 6040 10 % down or 6535 5 % down and there are a lot of different options . The breakdown goes as follows For 6040 10 % down 10 % of property price is paid as a down payment along with 2 % govt fees 50 % is paid in 46 installments over the course of usually 3 years while the property is under development 40 % is paid once the project is completed your unit is handed over to you Two very common strategies here are the Early stage flip Prehandover exit Early stage flip Investors get a unit at launch with a relatively low down payment 5 % or 10 % in projects that are expected to sell out rapidly due to strong demand and limited supply because not_all interested buyers are able to secure a unit they want and units often trade at a premium shortly after launch . Basically before the next installment is due usually around 6 months from purchase investors resell the contract at a premium typically in the range of $ 50000 $ 150000 depending on the project . Prehandover edit investors continue paying installments over the construction period . By the time the project nears completion and the handover payment is nearly due market value has often appreciated significantly especially when the asset is from a top developer in a strong location . So for example a unit purchased at $ 460K may be valued at around $ 730K $ 820K before handover allowing the investor to exit prior to the handover and realize capital appreciation without holding long term . Of course for investors who are willing to hold longer term capital appreciation can be a lot higher especially in prime locations . The strategies i mentioned above are typically used by investors who prefer shorter holding periods and faster capital recycling . _____ Now lets expand on the areas i mentioned earlier 1 . YAS ISLAND Entertainment Tourism Hub Beaches Golf Theme parks Nightlife Sports Concerts MMA F1 etc . Also the location of the upcoming 2030 DISNEYLAND Abu Dhabi . This is important because it will further boost tourism demand in the area and drive property value up . Stats as of Q4 2025 • Rental Yield 6.58.5 % • Villa Value Growth approx . 1218 % YoY • Apartment Value Growth approx . 811 % YoY Typical Prices • Studio Apartments $ 300K $ 400K • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 400K $ 500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 500K $ 800K • Villas Townhouses $ 1.3M $ 4m 2 . SAADIYAT ISLAND my personal favorite Lifestyle Cultural District Luxury Investing in property in Saadiyat is widely thought of as one of the strongest longterm real estate investments in the UAE . The island consistently shows high demand from local and international buyers supported by limited supply prestige branding . Saadiyat is also a magnet for HNWI . Property value in Saadiyat has doubled over the last few years . The Island is Abu Dhabis art cultural district has museums such as the Louvre the Guggenheim The national history museum Sheikh Zayed museum . Stats as of Q4 2025 • Rental Yield 5.57.5 % • Villa Value Growth approx . 1528 % YoY one of the highest in the UAE • Apartment Value Growth approx . 1015 % YoY Typical Prices • Studio Apartments $ 300K $ 600K • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 700K $ 1.4M • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 1.5M • Villas Townhouses $ 3M 3 . AL REEM ISLAND More affordable than Saadiyat Yas island but still very popular . A great community thats popular with younger professionals and expats . Stats as of Q4 2025 • Rental Yield 69 % • Apartment Value Growth approx . 712 % YoY Typical Prices • Studio Apartments $ 150K $ 250K • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 250K $ 500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 500K $ 750K • 3 Bedroom Apartments $ 750K $ 1.2M • 4 Bedroom Villas $ 1.7M $ 2.5M 4 . HUDAIRIYAT ISLAND A sports lifestyle hub . Mostly beachfront living with a focus on sports wellness . Hudairiyat is REALLY in demand right now . All the projects launched there are selling out instantly . For example the most recent one was Bashayer by MODON . It sold out in 1 day generating 3 Billion AED in sales . Typical Prices • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 650K $ 750K • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 850K $ 1.1M • 3 Bedroom Villas $ 1.2M $ 2.5M 5 . FAHID ISLAND Fahid Island is developed by Aldar is a wellnessfocused island positioned between Yas Island Saadiyat Island one of the most anticipated masterplanned developments in Abu Dhabi . Its designed around lowdensity living walkability greenery beaches and curated community facilities Its attracting strong investor end user interest mostly because of Aldars reputation the islands strategic location . Typical Prices • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 650K $ 800K • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 850K $ 1.1M • 3 Bedroom Apartments $ 1.2M $ 2M 5 . RAMHAN ISLAND Ramhan is a luxury natural island project developed by Eagle Hills focusing on private waterfront villas private beaches resortstyle living . It has VERY limited supply which makes it one of Abu Dhabis most exclusive residential projects . The island only has villas and each phase of the project only releases a small number of units so investors end users are attracted by the islands scarcity value privacy and long term capital appreciation potential . Ramhan is especially appealing to HNW buyers who are looking for a more private island lifestyle thats still close to the city . Typical Prices • 37 Bedroom Villas $ 2.5M $ 10M Personally I really believe in Saadiyat Island Yas Island Hudairiyat as longterm investments . I purchased offplan property in Saadiyat myself last year hope to invest in another project there soon as well . Given the market history the governments investments support in developing the areas and the very limited space left to build i just feel like options on these islands are becoming increasingly scarce . The scarcity combined with their prime locations makes them some of the best investments in the UAE right now . To give you an idea The offplan property i purchased from the developer last Aug for $ 1M Ive only paid the 5 % down payment 2 % first installment so far in total about $ 120k I could already sell for a $ 70k $ 85k profit today if i went for an early exit strat . If youd like to do a bit of research yourself look at the developer launch prices of projects in Saadiyat Island for example from last year like Mamsha Gardens The Row then look at the current resale prices theyre listed at on platforms like propertyfinder.ae or BAYUT . This will give you an idea of how fast offplan property value appreciates in an area like Saadiyat . Since im mostly explaining offplan investments here and also since theres of course a lot more information about offplan the secondary market UAE real estate in general for anyone that has more questions or wants to discuss further feel free to ask Im happy to answer"

      "selftext": "In mid-2025, Western media was flooded with headlines like: ‘China will fall ten years behind without Nvidia chips,’ ‘H200 is the AI key Beijing cannot replicate,’ and ‘U.S. chip bans will strangle China’s AI ambitions.’ Wall Street analysts predicted Nvidia would continue to dominate the global AI market with over 95% market share, and that China had ‘no choice’ but to accept Washington’s terms. Reality turned out very differently. On January 13, 2026, the Trump administration, after months of hardline sanctions, reversed course and allowed Nvidia to export H200 chips to China under a series of conditions: third-party inspections, a cap limiting China to at most 50% of the volume sold to the U.S., a ban on military use, and an additional 25% surcharge collected by the U.S. government. But just one day later (January 14), Chinese customs announced a suspension of H200 imports, leaving thousands of Nvidia’s expensive chips stuck at ports. This ‘drama’ was not random. It is a lesson Washington is now being forced to learn the hard way: the more sanctions intensify, the more determined China becomes to achieve self-reliance. And they are making progress Liu Ying, a researcher at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, made a remark that has forced Western analysts to rethink: ‘Looking back, the tariffs imposed by the United States on countries like China have actually promoted the diversification of our international trade and international cooperation, and have become a driving force behind China’s technological independence.’ China’s trade with ASEAN has surged, surpassing the U.S. to become its largest trading partner. Trade with the EU and with Belt and Road countries has seen double-digit growth. Trade with the U.S. has fallen by nearly 20%, yet China’s GDP still grew 5.2% in 2025. In semiconductors, this ‘catalyst effect’ is even more obvious. In 2024, Nvidia held 66% of China’s AI chip market. By early 2026, according to Bernstein forecasts, that share is expected to collapse to just 8%, while domestic Chinese firms (Huawei, Cambricon, Moore Threads, Iluvatar CoreX, etc.) are projected to take roughly 80% of the market. Zhang Jianzhong, CEO of Moore Threads, said confidently at the Huashan product launch: ‘Our new products meet the needs of domestic developers. There will be no need to wait for advanced foreign products anymore.’ Which is why sanctions against China were never a smart move. In reality, sanctions only accelerate China’s development.",

Reality turned out very differently . On January 13 2026 the Trump administration after months of hardline sanctions reversed course and allowed Nvidia to export H200 chips to China under a series of conditions thirdparty inspections a cap limiting China to at most 50 % of the volume sold to the U.S. a ban on military use and an additional 25 % surcharge collected by the U.S. government . But just one day later January 14 Chinese customs announced a suspension of H200 imports leaving thousands of Nvidia ’ s expensive chips stuck at ports . This ‘ drama ’ was not_random . It is a lesson Washington is now being forced to learn the hard way the more sanctions intensify the more determined China becomes to achieve selfreliance . And they are making progress Liu Ying a researcher at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies made a remark that has forced Western analysts to rethink ‘ Looking back the tariffs imposed by the United States on countries like China have actually promoted the diversification of our international trade and international cooperation and have become a driving force behind China ’ s technological independence. ’ China ’ s trade with ASEAN has surged surpassing the U.S. to become its largest trading partner . Trade with the EU and with Belt and Road countries has seen doubledigit growth . Trade with the U.S. has fallen by nearly 20 % yet China ’ s GDP still grew 5.2 % in 2025 . In semiconductors this ‘ catalyst effect ’ is even more obvious . In 2024 Nvidia held 66 % of China ’ s AI chip market . By early 2026 according to Bernstein forecasts that share is expected to collapse to just 8 % while domestic Chinese firms Huawei Cambricon Moore Threads Iluvatar CoreX etc . are projected to take roughly 80 % of the market . Zhang Jianzhong CEO of Moore Threads said confidently at the Huashan product launch ‘ Our new products meet the needs of domestic developers . There will be no_need to wait for advanced foreign products anymore. ’ Which is why sanctions against China were never_a smart move . In reality sanctions only accelerate China ’ s development ."

      "selftext": "From [The Guardian](#selection-1451.0-1523.194): The surge in the gold price is showing no sign of abating, as bullion continues to soar. Gold has jumped over the $5,500 an ounce level this morning, just three days after hitting $5,000 for the first time, taking its gains so far this year to almost 30% (!). It powered higher as investors continue to rush into safe haven assets, looking for protection against geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Precious metals are also benefiting from the weaker dollar, which has lurched lower after president Trump indicated this week he was comfortable with the currency’s year‑to‑date softness. That only encouraged fears of monetary debasement, boosting gold’s attractiveness. As Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, explains: “That sound you hear is that of 2026 gold targets being furiously revised higher, as the price keeps climbing, and given renewed impetus by Trump’s comments on the dollar. This will have fans of the debasement trade cheering in their seats, as it reinforces their thesis. “Each time precious seem at risk of running out of bullish momentum, something comes along to rescue it. So long as international investors keep dumping the dollar, the future for gold looks bright indeed.” Concerns around the independence of America’s central bank are also lifting gold. Although the US Federal Reserve resisted pressure from Trump and held interest rates last night, it may cut rates once a new chair has been installed to replace Jerome Powell later this year. That could weaken the dollar further, and lift inflation – two conditions which are good for the gold price. The rise in precious metals prices is “breathtaking and profoundly scary”, warns Robin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings Institute. He writes: “The rise in gold is part of something much bigger… all precious metals prices are going through the roof and gold is a laggard compared to silver and platinum. “At the same time, we’re seeing government bond markets in high-debt countries like Japan under severe pressure, even as there’s a flight to safety into countries with low debt like Sweden, Norway and Switzerland. Gold is therefore a symptom of something much bigger. We’re at the start of a global debt crisis, with markets increasingly fearful governments will attempt to inflate away out-of-control debt. Gold is just one of many assets that are getting a “safe haven” bid as part of this phenomenon.”",

      "selftext_processed": "From The Guardianselection1451.01523.194 The surge in the gold price is showing no_sign of abating as bullion continues to soar . Gold has jumped over the $ 5500 an ounce level this morning just three days after hitting $ 5000 for the first time taking its gains so far this year to almost 30 % . It powered higher as investors continue to rush into safe haven assets looking for protection against geopolitical and economic uncertainty . Precious metals are also benefiting from the weaker dollar which has lurched lower after president Trump indicated this week he was comfortable with the currency ’ s year‑to‑date softness . That only encouraged fears of monetary debasement boosting gold ’ s attractiveness . As Chris Beauchamp Chief Market Analyst at IG explains “ That sound you hear is that of 2026 gold targets being furiously revised higher as the price keeps climbing and given renewed impetus by Trump ’ s comments on the dollar . This will have fans of the debasement trade cheering in their seats as it reinforces their thesis . “ Each time precious seem at risk of running out of bullish momentum something comes along to rescue it . So long as international investors keep dumping the dollar the future for gold looks bright indeed. ” Concerns around the independence of America ’ s central bank are also lifting gold . Although the US Federal Reserve resisted pressure from Trump and held interest rates last night it may cut rates once a new chair has been installed to replace Jerome Powell later this year . That could weaken the dollar further and lift inflation – two conditions which are good for the gold price . The rise in precious metals prices is “ breathtaking and profoundly scary ” warns Robin Brooks senior fellow at Brookings Institute . He writes “ The rise in gold is part of something much bigger… all precious metals prices are going through the roof and gold is a laggard compared to silver and platinum . “ At the same time we ’ re seeing government bond markets in highdebt countries like Japan under severe pressure even as there ’ s a flight to safety into countries with low debt like Sweden Norway and Switzerland . Gold is therefore a symptom of something much bigger . We ’ re at the start of a global debt crisis with markets increasingly fearful governments will attempt to inflate away outofcontrol debt . Gold is just one of many assets that are getting a “ safe haven ” bid as part of this phenomenon . ”"

      "selftext": "Not sure if this breaks the rules, sorry in advance **My investing history as a 16yr old** **2019:** Spent 200$ on paydirt, ended up with about a gram of gold which was 60$ at the time. Contemplated buying a ounce of gold but never went through with it. (should have just bought pure 24k gold) Also thought about buying silver but never saw any potential. **2022:** Started buying stocks. Didnt really make anything **2024:** Started actually investing in stocks. Bought some stocks and ended up making a few hundred bucks. Also lost a couple hundred bucks. Took a break for a little while. **2025:** Got back into stocks around the end of summer. Bought some MPWR when it was at around 590$ in January but sold in February after it started dropping and was at a strong selling point, only made like 30$. Also bought a few TSLA shares and made a good bit of change when it hit 400$. Bought and sold a few things here and there, didn't really make much and ended taking another break for a few months. Eventually bought a whole share (6.5 shares after split) of netflix at 1.16k (116$ after split) right before the 10 to 1 split expecting a rise in buyers only for it to slowly drop in price. Thought about buying META (650$ - 660$), MPWR (900 - 950$), and TSLA (450 -480$) but decided not to since none of them had dropped, and for the most part they were going up. **2026:** Fast forward to today, held on to netflix since the split but the WB deal has drained -27% of my shares, gold is at 5.5k per ounce (genuinely insane), silver is 120$ per ounce (also insane), MPWR is at 1.16k right now, META is at 713$ (a 6.6% increase in after hours), TSLA is at 430$ right now, and NFLX is at 84$ right now. Overall: Should have bought gold bars Should have stuck with MPWR Should have bought META Shouldn't have doubted the power of silver Shouldn't have bought TSLA Should have 100% done more research.",

Contemplated buying a ounce of gold but never_went through with it . should have just bought pure 24k gold Also thought about buying silver but never_saw any potential . 2022 Started buying stocks . Didnt really make anything 2024 Started actually investing in stocks . Bought some stocks and ended up making a few hundred bucks . Also lost a couple hundred bucks . Took a break for a little while . 2025 Got back into stocks around the end of summer . Bought some MPWR when it was at around 590 $ in January but sold in February after it started dropping and was at a strong selling point only made like 30 $ . Also bought a few TSLA shares and made a good bit of change when it hit 400 $ . Bought and sold a few things here and there didnt really make much and ended taking another break for a few months . Eventually bought a whole share 6.5 shares after split of netflix at 1.16k 116 $ after split right before the 10 to 1 split expecting a rise in buyers only for it to slowly drop in price . Thought about buying META 650 $ 660 $ MPWR 900 950 $ and TSLA 450 480 $ but decided not_to since none of them had dropped and for the most part they were going up . 2026 Fast forward to today held on to netflix since the split but the WB deal has drained 27 % of my shares gold is at 5.5k per ounce genuinely insane silver is 120 $ per ounce also insane MPWR is at 1.16k right now META is at 713 $ a 6.6 % increase in after hours TSLA is at 430 $ right now and NFLX is at 84 $ right now . Overall Should have bought gold bars Should have stuck with MPWR Should have bought META Shouldnt have doubted the power of silver Shouldnt have bought TSLA Should have 100 % done more research ."

      "selftext": "Hello, I thought I would make 2026 my year for investing. I am tackling it 3 ways. 1. Back in May of 2024 I took advantage of a Schwab deal to match $100 when creating a new account and depositing $100. Not sure if I chose it or not, but they put the $100+$100 in some mixed tech stock. Google, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft. From then until now the $200 grew to $268.12. 2. To dabble in Crypto mining, I bought a couple small miners to mine Zcash. Seems it was one of the tokens that was showing some growth but got whacked with the developers all quit, but it seems to be hanging in there. They have been mining less than a month and have earned .06 ZEC, ie, about $21. I am probably losing money due to electricity cost, but they are heating my house :) I intend to move them to my off-grid property where I have a solar array and having already made the investment, basically free electricity. It will take a long time just to recoup the hardware cost, but that is already money down the drain. 3. I took advantage of a Rakuten $150 CB by opening a Kraken account and needing to spend $200 within a month. I just bought $210 worth of BTC which had a $3.10 fee. Will have to wait for the $150 CB. On the surface, my senile mind thinks the Schwab investment has the best potential unless crypto starts doing something. I realize these are piddling amounts and pocket change to you guys, but it is a start. I suspect my 36a of off-grid property in AZ was my best purchase. Are you guys on team crypto, or team stocks, or perhaps team real estate? I am going to forge ahead with mining crypto as the hardware investment was made, and I couldn't pass up the CB on the Kraken account, but not sure where I should move the money? Thoughts? Thanks!",

Back in May of 2024 I took advantage of a Schwab deal to match $ 100 when creating a new account and depositing $ 100 . Not_sure if I chose it or not_but they put the $ 100 $ 100 in some mixed tech stock . Google Apple Nvidia Amazon and Microsoft . From then until now the $ 200 grew to $ 268.12 . 2 . To dabble in Crypto mining I bought a couple small miners to mine Zcash . Seems it was one of the tokens that was showing some growth but got whacked with the developers all quit but it seems to be hanging in there . They have been mining less than a month and have earned .06 ZEC ie about $ 21 . I am probably losing money due to electricity cost but they are heating my house I intend to move them to my offgrid property where I have a solar array and having already made the investment basically free electricity .

Get more breaking news on Wall St’s top AI stocks with InvestingPro The talks come as OpenAI seeks to raise up to $100 billion to fund its AI and data center ambitions. The funding round will value the ChatGPT maker at about $830 billion. Reports earlier this week said Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984) was in talks to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, adding to its $41 billion investment in the startup, which it completed in December. OpenAI and Softbank have undertaken a $500 billion project– Stargate– to build AI data centers in the United States.",

I'm a late starter obviously, but I'm committed to contributing $200 biweekly for now until my salary increases, or household costs come down. I was playing around for a while with another TFSA on the side with Wealthsimple, just $50 biweekly, buying and researching ETFS, bonds, and individual stocks, and just learning more in general. It was supposed to be my fun savings account, but I just can't afford that extra $50 biweekly unfortunately, so I've just committed to my one with RBC for now until it grows to a bigger number, and also so I don't have to think about it for now and just focus on saving more liquidity. I'm wondering if I should increase my RBC TFSA to medium-high risk for now, seeing as I still have a long time in the investment horizon, and then lower it back to low-medium risk when I'm older in my 40-50s, and even just transfer it all to my own portfolio on Wealthsimple one day to save even further on MER.",

$ 100k that most sellside shops expect you to pay for their shitty reports DBS has you covered heres the method 1. search up the stock ticker of the company you want with equity research filetypepdf on google . scroll a bit down and youll eventually be able to find the most recent DBS report available regarding the stock . for example just searching up CVX equity reseach filetypepdf got me the report they published literally 2 days ago on chevron 2. once youre there press the web address and change it from the company you had before to another company you wanted to look at . using the chevron example you change it from to by just by changing that last part at the end make sure to capitalize it i have no_idea what type of security precautions DBS has employed but nearly every megacap that they have covered is literally publicly available for anyone to see . for example ... mag 7 coverage from DBS Tesla Meta Apple Google Nvidia Amazon Microsoft yep ... they all work and literally all the most recent reports they have available . you know ... the same analyst reports that wall street firms pay hundreds of thousands to get continuous access too . i honestly have no_idea when theyre going to patch this up but this is too fucking hilarious not_to bring up . if youve ever wanted to see how the people paid to lose money think when it comes to earnings ... heres your shot . edit ive managed to find that these motherfuckers somehow manage to not_only publish their analyst reports but whole industry and sectors reports that are actually more detailed than a report analysts shit out when they need to justify upgrading or downgrading . all you need to do is search industry dbs filetypepdf technology outlook 2026 outlook weekly macro insights from their

For subsea robotics they are considered the best compared to their peers. ased on recent news, my understanding is the most urgent needs for the the US military to address is: (a) US Navy build-out given that China ship-building capacity vastly out-strips the the US at this point, and they have been they have been making inroads in gaining control over critical global sea infrastructure across the world (note, this was the reason Venezuela mattered...Panama isthmus... oil is simply a means of saying this military incursion will not cost the taxpayer and it is also the reason why Greenland matters. (b) Reclaiming dominance in the Artic Circle, where China has been mapping the seafloor like mad. So bottom line is - US is completely dominant in Space, Missiles, and Air - but sea is more dicey than anything else. I expect spend going forward here to be very aggressive. So back to OII...compare is to OIH (oil services companies) and it trades basically in tandem with that. It also has an oil services multiple of \\~1x ev / sales and 5x ev / ebidtda. However what they call AdTech has long been the fastest growing segment. Here is some of what they are capable of. [ Now to the interesting part: The March DoD Contract. In March 2025 they received a Maritime Mobility System that they simply list as largest initial contract value in the company’s history. The specific dollar amount for that award remains undisclosed due to its sensitive nature with the U.S. Department of Defense. Note, this is a serious company, they make about 3b in rev a year. They don't play any games. In other words, there is no reason for them to play coy and tease shareholders. In Q1 2025, they stated AdTech margins took a hit as they took on readiness costs for this new contract. Bottom line, the company is making the shift from being a subcontractor (a \"part-maker\") to the lead company managing an entire military program - in one of the hottest and most urgent areas of DoD defense spend. What's this worth if the market views it as a robotics and defense pure play? What are the comps here? Well, right now the only decent comp is Kraken. Which is now a 2b ev off of \\~20m in quarterly rev. Again OII is only 3b ev against \\~750m in quarterly revenue. Kraken is looking a 27x / sales vs 1x sales for OII. I am not here to talk shit about Kraken. I think the company is great and could continue to rip. My point is simply this - the market is very, very thirsty for subsea military tech. So thirsty, they seem to form cults around them. This brings me to my other major points - the S Korean retail interest. From what I understand this is one of the most influential S Korean retail accounts.. Which is well deserved given the guy way beating the drum on RKLB consistently since early on. He rarely pitches new names, and when he does people sit up and listen. In this case, the OII post got about \\~200k views and very enthusiastic responses. After seeing what the S Koreans did to quantum, my general heuristic is - when they take an early interest in something I reach for the highest strikes possible. In sum, if this was given a reasonable multiple of 3x sales and 15x ebidtda, this would would be 3x on the commons...which given the modest IV would translate to \\~20x on a many of the strikes. And if this were to run to unreasonable valuations - which seems to be the case with the other subsea pure plays like Kraken and anything the S Korean retail takes a liking to, this could be bar none the trade of the year. Disclosure: I have call options from feb to july and strikes from 22.5 to 40.",

      "selftext_processed": "OII has historically been an oil services company but internally it has been making a much underappreciated shift to an autonomy robotics and defense company . For subsea robotics they are considered the best compared to their peers . ased on recent news my understanding is the most urgent needs for the the US military to address is a US Navy buildout given that China shipbuilding capacity vastly outstrips the the US at this point and they have been they have been making inroads in gaining control over critical global sea infrastructure across the world note this was the reason Venezuela mattered ... Panama isthmus ... oil is simply a means of saying this military incursion will not_cost the taxpayer and it is also the reason why Greenland matters . b Reclaiming dominance in the Artic Circle where China has been mapping the seafloor like mad . So bottom line is US is completely dominant in Space Missiles and Air but sea is more dicey than anything else . I expect spend going forward here to be very aggressive . So back to OII ... compare is to OIH oil services companies and it trades basically in tandem with that . It also has an oil services multiple of 1x ev sales and 5x ev ebidtda . However what they call AdTech has long been the fastest growing segment . Here is some of what they are capable of . Now to the interesting part The March DoD Contract . In March 2025 they received a Maritime Mobility System that they simply list as largest initial contract value in the company ’ s history . The specific dollar amount for that award remains undisclosed due to its sensitive nature with the U.S. Department of Defense . Note this is a serious company they make about 3b in rev a year . They dont play any games . In other words there is no_reason for them to play coy and tease shareholders . In Q1 2025 they stated AdTech margins took a hit as they took on readiness costs for this new contract . Bottom line the company is making the shift from being a subcontractor a partmaker to the lead company managing an entire military program in one of the hottest and most urgent areas of DoD defense spend . Whats this worth if the market views it as a robotics and defense pure play What are the comps here Well right now the only decent comp is Kraken . Which is now a 2b ev off of 20m in quarterly rev . Again OII is only 3b ev against 750m in quarterly revenue . Kraken is looking a 27x sales vs 1x sales for OII . I am not_here to talk shit about Kraken . I think the company is great and could continue to rip . My point is simply this the market is very very thirsty for subsea military tech . So thirsty they seem to form cults around them . This brings me to my other major points the S Korean retail interest . From what I understand this is one of the most influential S Korean retail accounts .. Which is well deserved given the guy way beating the drum on RKLB consistently since early on . He rarely pitches new names and when he does people sit up and listen . In this case the OII post got about 200k views and very enthusiastic responses . After seeing what the S Koreans did to quantum my general heuristic is when they take an early interest in something I reach for the highest strikes possible . In sum if this was given a reasonable multiple of 3x sales and 15x ebidtda this would would be 3x on the commons ... which given the modest IV would translate to 20x on a many of the strikes . And if this were to run to unreasonable valuations which seems to be the case with the other subsea pure plays like Kraken and anything the S Korean retail takes a liking to this could be bar none the trade of the year . Disclosure I have call options from feb to july and strikes from 22.5 to 40 ."

The shift, which comes as ​a U.S. Senate committee is reviewing a price floor extended last year to MP Materials, marks a reversal from commitments made to industry and could set ‌Washington apart from G7 partners discussing some form of joint price support or related measures to bolster production of critical minerals used in electric vehicles, semiconductors, defense systems and consumer electronics. At a closed-door meeting earlier this ‌month hosted by a Washington think tank, two senior Trump officials told U.S. minerals executives that their projects would need to prove their financial independence without government price support, three attendees told Reuters. \"We're not here to prop you guys up,\" Audrey Robertson, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy and head of its Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation, told the executives. \"Don't come to us expecting that.\" Source:",

      "selftext": "Tesla said on Wednesday that it’s agreed to invest about $2 billion into Elon Musk’s xAI, which he launched almost three years ago as a prospective competitor to OpenAI. The share purchase was related to xAI’s $20 billion financing round announced earlier this month. The artificial intelligence startup is best known for developing Grok, an AI chatbot and image generator. “Tesla’s investment was made on market terms consistent with those previously agreed to by other investors in the financing round,” the company said in its fourth-quarter earnings report. When Musk formed xAI as a Nevada public benefit corporation in March 2023, he did so without immediately disclosing the existence the company to Tesla shareholders. He debuted xAI in July that year, and the company dropped the public benefit corporation and related commitments in 2024. Of late, xAI has been at the center of regulatory probes across the globe concerning Grok. A recent Grok release, integrated into X, had enabled the widespread creation and dissemination of deepfake explicit images, based on photos of real people without their consent. The European Commission recently initiated a formal probe, as did the California Department of Justice, and agencies in Australia, India, Ireland and France. Other countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, rapidly moved to suspend Grok until the company stops enabling mass production of content deemed illegal in their jurisdictions. Tesla includes Grok as a feature in some electric vehicle infotainment systems. In Tesla’s shareholder deck on Wednesday, the company said it had “entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment,” to begin “evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies.” Tesla said the investment is “subject to customary regulatory conditions with the expectation to close in Q1′2026.” Source: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Tesla said on Wednesday that it ’ s agreed to invest about $ 2 billion into Elon Musk ’ s xAI which he launched almost three years ago as a prospective competitor to OpenAI . The share purchase was related to xAI ’ s $ 20 billion financing round announced earlier this month . The artificial intelligence startup is best known for developing Grok an AI chatbot and image generator . “ Tesla ’ s investment was made on market terms consistent with those previously agreed to by other investors in the financing round ” the company said in its fourthquarter earnings report . When Musk formed xAI as a Nevada public benefit corporation in March 2023 he did so without immediately disclosing the existence the company to Tesla shareholders . He debuted xAI in July that year and the company dropped the public benefit corporation and related commitments in 2024 . Of late xAI has been at the center of regulatory probes across the globe concerning Grok . A recent Grok release integrated into X had enabled the widespread creation and dissemination of deepfake explicit images based on photos of real people without their consent . The European Commission recently initiated a formal probe as did the California Department of Justice and agencies in Australia India Ireland and France . Other countries including Malaysia and Indonesia rapidly moved to suspend Grok until the company stops enabling mass production of content deemed illegal in their jurisdictions . Tesla includes Grok as a feature in some electric vehicle infotainment systems . In Tesla ’ s shareholder deck on Wednesday the company said it had “ entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment ” to begin “ evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies. ” Tesla said the investment is “ subject to customary regulatory conditions with the expectation to close in Q1′2026. ” Source"

      "title": "The Missing Link in the Semiconductor Supply Chain: Canatu",
      "selftext": "I’ve been researching a small Finnish company called **Canatu**, and it’s one of the most interesting investments I’ve come across in a while. It’s not a semiconductor company, not an AI company, and not a software business. It sits much deeper in the stack, at a physical bottleneck the entire AI and advanced chip industry quietly depends on. ***Quick disclaimer:*** *this is a deep-tech, supply-chain-driven idea. It’s not a clean financial multiple story and it requires some comfort with semiconductor manufacturing and physics. If that’s not your thing, feel free to skip. Also, none of this is investment advice.* The core of the thesis is simple: advanced chips are now constrained by physics, not software. As chipmakers push toward smaller nodes using EUV lithography, the limiting factor is no longer design, but materials. When you push hundreds of watts of extreme ultraviolet light through a system measured in nanometers, even microscopic weaknesses become billion-dollar problems. At the center of this process is the photomask, the blueprint of the chip. To protect it from contamination, EUV machines use an ultra-thin membrane called a pellicle. If a single dust particle hits the mask, yield can collapse instantly. Pellicles are therefore mandatory, but existing silicon-based pellicles are approaching their physical limits as EUV power increases. This is where Canatu enters the picture. They’ve developed carbon-nanotube (CNT) pellicles that can withstand far higher heat, deform far less, and transmit more EUV light than conventional solutions. As EUV systems transition toward High-NA EUV, those properties shift from nice to have to necessary. What makes Canatu particularly interesting is that they don’t plan to become a huge centralized manufacturer. Instead, they’re trying to scale via a licensing + tool model: * Reactor sales (specialized production equipment) * Proprietary consumables (inputs needed to run the reactor) * Per-unit licensing fees (royalty for each pellicle produced) So the customer carries capex and scaling complexity, while Canatu captures recurring economics if the technology becomes standard. That model creates leverage because pellicles are consumables, not permanent components. As EUV power rises, pellicle lifetimes shorten and replacement frequency increases. Even if High-NA EUV is a minority of wafer volume, it can drive a majority of pellicle demand due to higher burn rate. From a market structure perspective, this looks less like a classic manufacturer and more like a materials toll booth embedded into EUV. Think ARM rather than Intel, or Entegris rather than TSMC. If chips are made on ASML machines, something must sit between the photons and the mask, and that something increasingly looks like CNT pellicles. There are also real validation signals. Canatu signed a licensing deal with FST, a Korean supplier often interpreted as a bridge into Samsung’s ecosystem. Management has referenced two major Asian semiconductor clients (commonly speculated as Samsung + TSMC). Semiconductor revenue already dominates their sales and has been growing quickly. One part of my research focused on modeling how pellicle demand scales as logic fabs gradually transition from Low-NA to High-NA EUV, because this is where the non-linear upside comes from. The key insight is that pellicle demand does not scale with wafer volume, but with exposure intensity. High-NA tools use higher source power, more EUV layers per wafer, and impose much harsher thermal stress on pellicles, which shortens their usable life. In practical terms, a High-NA scanner consumes pellicles several times faster than a Low-NA tool. When you combine a slow but steady increase in High-NA share with higher burn rates, you get a demand curve where a minority of wafers can drive a majority of pellicle consumption. Even under conservative assumptions, my model shows pellicle demand in leading-edge logic fabs growing multiples faster than wafer output itself as High-NA adoption progresses through the second half of the decade. This is still a small-cap (\\~€300M), listed on Nasdaq First North Finland, it is a SPAC, so some future dilution from warrants and earn-outs is expected. That said, I find the asymmetry compelling. This isn’t a bet on which AI company wins. It’s a bet that physics does not negotiate, and that when an industry hits hard material limits, small specialized suppliers can quietly become indispensable. I’m curious how others here view this kind of deep supply-chain infrastructure play, especially anyone with semiconductor or lithography experience. Happy to be challenged.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been researching a small Finnish company called Canatu and it ’ s one of the most interesting investments I ’ ve come across in a while . It ’ s not_a semiconductor company not_an AI company and not_a software business . It sits much deeper in the stack at a physical bottleneck the entire AI and advanced chip industry quietly depends on . Quick disclaimer this is a deeptech supplychaindriven idea . It ’ s not_a clean financial multiple story and it requires some comfort with semiconductor manufacturing and physics . If that ’ s not_your thing feel free to skip . Also none of this is investment advice . The core of the thesis is simple advanced chips are now constrained by physics not_software . As chipmakers push toward smaller nodes using EUV lithography the limiting factor is no_longer design but materials . When you push hundreds of watts of extreme ultraviolet light through a system measured in nanometers even microscopic weaknesses become billiondollar problems . At the center of this process is the photomask the blueprint of the chip . To protect it from contamination EUV machines use an ultrathin membrane called a pellicle . If a single dust particle hits the mask yield can collapse instantly . Pellicles are therefore mandatory but existing siliconbased pellicles are approaching their physical limits as EUV power increases . This is where Canatu enters the picture . They ’ ve developed carbonnanotube CNT pellicles that can withstand far higher heat deform far less and transmit more EUV light than conventional solutions . As EUV systems transition toward HighNA EUV those properties shift from nice to have to necessary . What makes Canatu particularly interesting is that they don ’ t plan to become a huge centralized manufacturer . Instead they ’ re trying to scale via a licensing tool model Reactor sales specialized production equipment Proprietary consumables inputs needed to run the reactor Perunit licensing fees royalty for each pellicle produced So the customer carries capex and scaling complexity while Canatu captures recurring economics if the technology becomes standard . That model creates leverage because pellicles are consumables not_permanent components . As EUV power rises pellicle lifetimes shorten and replacement frequency increases . Even if HighNA EUV is a minority of wafer volume it can drive a majority of pellicle demand due to higher burn rate . From a market structure perspective this looks less like a classic manufacturer and more like a materials toll booth embedded into EUV . Think ARM rather than Intel or Entegris rather than TSMC . If chips are made on ASML machines something must sit between the photons and the mask and that something increasingly looks like CNT pellicles . There are also real validation signals . Canatu signed a licensing deal with FST a Korean supplier often interpreted as a bridge into Samsung ’ s ecosystem . Management has referenced two major Asian semiconductor clients commonly speculated as Samsung TSMC . Semiconductor revenue already dominates their sales and has been growing quickly . One part of my research focused on modeling how pellicle demand scales as logic fabs gradually transition from LowNA to HighNA EUV because this is where the nonlinear upside comes from . The key insight is that pellicle demand does not_scale with wafer volume but with exposure intensity . HighNA tools use higher source power more EUV layers per wafer and impose much harsher thermal stress on pellicles which shortens their usable life . In practical terms a HighNA scanner consumes pellicles several times faster than a LowNA tool . When you combine a slow but steady increase in HighNA share with higher burn rates you get a demand curve where a minority of wafers can drive a majority of pellicle consumption . Even under conservative assumptions my model shows pellicle demand in leadingedge logic fabs growing multiples faster than wafer output itself as HighNA adoption progresses through the second half of the decade . This is still a smallcap €300M listed on Nasdaq First North Finland it is a SPAC so some future dilution from warrants and earnouts is expected . That said I find the asymmetry compelling . This isn ’ t a bet on which AI company wins . It ’ s a bet that physics does not_negotiate and that when an industry hits hard material limits small specialized suppliers can quietly become indispensable . I ’ m curious how others here view this kind of deep supplychain infrastructure play especially anyone with semiconductor or lithography experience . Happy to be challenged ."

      "selftext": "*Preface:* I am not looking for financial advice, I will continue to do my own research, I am mainly looking for new funds to explore and expand my perspectives on my strategy. I am relatively new to actively managing my own investments, even though I was able to build a solid base through my 401k and through a ROTH conversion from a prior plan this was mostly managed for me through my old advisor and/or the 2060 retirement date that i just had all of my money in. I enjoy bouncing ideas around and understanding how different people think about portfolio construction, so I am hoping that I can do that here. I’ll also say upfront: Bogleheads, I respect the philosophy and the reminders that beating the market consistently is difficult, but I am hoping to avoid that debate here. Thank you in advance. All of my money is now with Fidelity. I recently switched from American Funds and have been happy so far, especially with the broader fund selection and the elimination of load fees. **Current balances:** * Roth IRA: \\~$90k * 401k: \\~$95k * Taxable (TOD): \\~$18k **Current allocations:** Roth IRA * 50% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 25% FDCPX 401(k) * 100% FDKLX (Target Date 2060) Taxable (TOD) * 65% FSELX * 25% FXAIX * 10% AGTHX (legacy holding from American Funds) I’m 32 and intentionally running a very aggressive strategy, but I’m starting to think more about diversification. I’m especially curious whether there are any non-tech or non-semiconductor funds that people feel have historically outperformed or provided strong long-term returns. I know I want to replace FDCPX, since it’s also tech-heavy and overlaps with FSELX, I am just not sure with what yet. I’ve also considered switching FCNTX to either FXAIX or FBGRX, but my hesitation is that FCNTX seems to have stronger lifetime performance than FXAIX and feels more complementary to FSELX than FBGRX, which appears more growth- and tech-concentrated. **Restructure plan as of now:** Roth IRA * 50% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 15% FSENX * 10% FFFCX 401(k) * 100% FDKLX (Target Date 2060) Taxable (TOD) * 40% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 20% FSENX * 10% AGTHX * 5% FFFCX I’m interested in hearing how others think about this - not necessarily what to do, but how to think about it, although I am open to some suggestions.",

      "selftext": "I’m newish to investing. I’m looking for something that I feel should exist but I can’t find it. I want to see what ETF component stocks affected today’s pricing change the most. Something like the top 10 positive contributors and the top 10 negative contributors by weight to that ETF. If, for instance, stock A is 5% of the ETF and it went up 8%, it would have contributed +0.4% to the fund’s performance. If stock B is 1% of the fund, and went down by 20%, it would have contributed -0.2%. So, if VOO is down, why? Did Nvidia drop a fair amount and everything else was stable, or did all the banks drop due to a regulation change, etc? I can find S&P 500 movers but, since they are not weighted, it doesn’t tell the story. Not to mention I am looking for this for any given ETF. Does this exist and my searches suck? Does this not exist because it’s solved another way?",

      "selftext": "I’ve been building my portfolio for a few years now, but with the current sentiment around an AI bubble, I’m starting to feel over-leveraged in tech. Currently sitting on about $70k total and looking for a sanity check on my risk management strategy. Portfolio Breakdown: • VOO: $30k (Taxable) • Tencent (TCEHY): $10k • Roth IRA: $20k (Broad market ETFs) • Misc: $10k in individual stocks The Concern: Between VOO’s heavy weighting in mag-seven/AI and my Tencent position, my exposure to a tech correction is significant. I’m trying to decide the best way to \"crash-proof\" without being an emotional seller. Specifically: 1. Stop-Losses vs. Hedging: Does anyone actually use limit sells/stop-losses for long-term holds like VOO, or is the risk of being \"stopped out\" during a flash dip too high? 2. The Tencent Position: It’s a large chunk of my individual holdings. Given the current macro environment, would you trim this to rotate into a more defensive sector? 3. Strategy: For those who think we are in a bubble, are you staying the course with the S&P 500, or are you moving toward a higher bond/cash position to buy a potential dip? Not looking to \"time the market\" perfectly, just want to ensure I'm not being reckless by holding through a potential 2000-style tech pop.",

Currently sitting on about $ 70k total and looking for a sanity check on my risk management strategy . Portfolio Breakdown • VOO $ 30k Taxable • Tencent TCEHY $ 10k • Roth IRA $ 20k Broad market ETFs • Misc $ 10k in individual stocks The Concern Between VOO ’ s heavy weighting in magsevenAI and my Tencent position my exposure to a tech correction is significant . I ’ m trying to decide the best way to crashproof without being an emotional seller . Specifically 1 . StopLosses vs . Hedging Does anyone actually use limit sellsstoplosses for longterm holds like VOO or is the risk of being stopped out during a flash dip too high 2 . The Tencent Position It ’ s a large chunk of my individual holdings . Given the current macro environment would you trim this to rotate into a more defensive sector 3 . Strategy For those who think we are in a bubble are you staying the course with the SP 500 or are you moving toward a higher bondcash position to buy a potential dip Not_looking to time the market perfectly just want to ensure Im not_being reckless by holding through a potential 2000style tech pop ."

To train and run large-scale AI, you also need: \\- Infrastructure (data centers, networking, cooling) \\- Energy (significant power to run the systems) This means that the economic upside isn’t limited to the big tech names. Mid and smaller cap companies in infrastructure and energy could see significant growth if AI adoption continues. AI is more then digital, it’s physical, capital-intensive, and energy-dependant. Do you think the real AI winners are the mega-caps everyone knows, or the broader stack of infrastructure and energy companies?",

To train and run largescale AI you also need Infrastructure data centers networking cooling Energy significant power to run the systems This means that the economic upside isn ’ t limited to the big tech names . Mid and smaller cap companies in infrastructure and energy could see significant growth if AI adoption continues . AI is more then digital it ’ s physical capitalintensive and energydependant . Do you think the real AI winners are the megacaps everyone knows or the broader stack of infrastructure and energy companies"

      "selftext": "The U.S. Department of Energy is significantly expanding efforts to secure and rebuild the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain to support both the existing reactor fleet and next-generation nuclear technologies. The DOE has awarded roughly $2.7 billion in long-term uranium enrichment contracts to boost U.S. production of low-enriched uranium and high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and strengthening energy security. Expanded domestic enrichment capacity is expected to underpin future reactor builds and improve fuel supply reliability across the nuclear sector, particularly as advanced reactor deployments move closer to commercialization. This initiative fits into a broader federal strategy to reinforce nuclear energy infrastructure through supply-chain investment and reactor deployment support. These policy moves have already driven investor interest in uranium and nuclear-adjacent equities, especially companies positioned along the fuel and advanced reactor value chain. For emerging developers like $OKLO, improved access to domestic enrichment and fuel fabrication capacity helps address one of the key bottlenecks facing advanced reactors, potentially de-risking timelines and improving long-term commercialization prospects.",

      "selftext_processed": "The U.S. Department of Energy is significantly expanding efforts to secure and rebuild the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain to support both the existing reactor fleet and nextgeneration nuclear technologies . The DOE has awarded roughly $ 2.7 billion in longterm uranium enrichment contracts to boost U.S. production of lowenriched uranium and highassay lowenriched uranium HALEU reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and strengthening energy security . Expanded domestic enrichment capacity is expected to underpin future reactor builds and improve fuel supply reliability across the nuclear sector particularly as advanced reactor deployments move closer to commercialization . This initiative fits into a broader federal strategy to reinforce nuclear energy infrastructure through supplychain investment and reactor deployment support . These policy moves have already driven investor interest in uranium and nuclearadjacent equities especially companies positioned along the fuel and advanced reactor value chain . For emerging developers like $ OKLO improved access to domestic enrichment and fuel fabrication capacity helps address one of the key bottlenecks facing advanced reactors potentially derisking timelines and improving longterm commercialization prospects ."

      "selftext": "I am currently holding a decent amount of SNDK shares. Today I was interested in APH earnings and thinking of buying pre earnings. I waited and the stock had good earnings and guidance, but it still fell 15%. I’m guessing that people bought pre earnings and then took some profits after earnings posted. Now I know that SNDK and APH \"Amphenol Corp\" are not apples to apples but they do have a lot in common. Both have a lot in common. Both have had huge increases due to AI buildout Both have very high PE and forward PE SNDK’s current call/put ration is nearly 1, meaning people feel it could go either way. So the question. What are other holders planning on doing before earnings? Sit back and watch? Trim a bit and maybe DCA after? Sell all pre earnings? I cant make up my mind but I’m thinking of just riding it out.

      "selftext": "Selling VUG in taxable account to rebalance I’m 27 and have about $27,000 in a taxable brokerage account with Robinhood. I was investing 50/30/20 in VOO/VUG/VXUS, and that is the current breakdown of my portfolio balance. I would like to now aim for a 70/30 split in VOO/VXUS as I am worried I am too leveraged into US large cap growth, especially with a looming tech bubble. My question is, should I: 1) sell off my VUG position and rebalance into VOO/VXUS since I have held the assets for more than a year and should be in the 15% capital gains bracket based on my standard income? 2) sell off VUG and put it into VTI instead of VOO to better hedge against the tech bubble pop, and keep investing in VTI going forward? 3) not touch VUG at all and just continue to invest in VOO/VXUS or VTI/VXUS moving forward? Best I can figure is about $150 in taxes from capital gains, which I think I can offset by tax loss harvesting a solo stock I bought years ago as a crap shoot that’s down $144. Is that all not worth it and should I just sit on it and let my future allocations act to rebalance and dilute the impact it will have on me? Edit: I got my tax loss harvesting wrong, my gains from VUG are about $1000 so the -$144 from the stock does very little.",

I was investing 503020 in VOOVUGVXUS and that is the current breakdown of my portfolio balance . I would like to now aim for a 7030 split in VOOVXUS as I am worried I am too leveraged into US large cap growth especially with a looming tech bubble . My question is should I 1 sell off my VUG position and rebalance into VOOVXUS since I have held the assets for more than a year and should be in the 15 % capital gains bracket based on my standard income 2 sell off VUG and put it into VTI instead of VOO to better hedge against the tech bubble pop and keep investing in VTI going forward 3 not_touch VUG at all and just continue to invest in VOOVXUS or VTIVXUS moving forward Best I can figure is about $ 150 in taxes from capital gains which I think I can offset by tax loss harvesting a solo stock I bought years ago as a crap shoot that ’ s down $ 144 . Is that all not_worth it and should I just sit on it and let my future allocations act to rebalance and dilute the impact it will have on me Edit I got my tax loss harvesting wrong my gains from VUG are about $ 1000 so the $ 144 from the stock does very little ."

The Asian nation’s stock market climbed to a valuation of $3.25 trillion, after adding roughly $1.7 trillion since the start of 2025, according to Bloomberg-compiled data as of Wednesday. That surpassed Germany’s $3.22 trillion, making Korea the world’s 10th‑largest stock market, just behind Taiwan. The reshuffling in rankings highlights the swift rise of Korean stocks, driven by shareholder‑friendly reforms and the nation’s pivotal role in the global AI supply chain. The equity benchmark Kospi has jumped 23% in 2026, while Germany’s Dax Index has climbed just 1.7%, weighed down by geopolitical uncertainties and a lack of clarity over stimulus deployment.",

      "title": "Are we Close to Another Top?",
      "selftext": "Back in early October, I made a post claiming that QQQ with top out at about $637, most people said I was crazy, then ironically, that was the exact spot it corrected weeks later. Here we are three months later, and we are just about at that level again. So now what? With the recent batch of earnings, it does appear the market is building strength, but there are a few signs that underlying market weakness is continuing to build. Maybe we top out here, or maybe resistance breaks, only to produce a throw over, which is common on the fifth wave of an Elliott structure. Other issues I’m seeing… # Liquidity Liquidity is the first and most important piece of the puzzle. Liquidity is essentially the fuel that drives financial markets. A perfect example of this was during Covid when the government stimulus helped power a major rally. On the other hand, when the liquidity dries up, markets often struggle even if fundamentals are strong. Many traders don’t look at liquidity at all, others only focus on if the Fed is engaging in quantitative easing or quantitative tightening, but that’s only part of the story. Another important tool is the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement facility, commonly referred to as RRP. This program allows large financial institutions, especially money market funds, to park cash at the Fed overnight in exchange for Treasury securities. Last year, markets held up better than expected during the quantitative tightening phase because money was flowing out of the RRP and back into the financial system. Essentially, RRP acted as a cushion against the quantitative tightening process. Take a look at RRP now… [ That cushion is now essentially gone. Balances in the RRP facility have fallen from roughly $2.5 trillion in 2023 to only about a billion today. That is essentially nothing. When the tank is empty, it becomes concerning. The large pool of idle cash that could flow back into the system is now gone, and so is the excess fuel that can power the market forward; this is generally negative for stocks. # Put/Call Ratio One of my favorite sentiment indicators and one of the indicators that is often overlooked is the put/call ratio. This indicator compares the volume of put options traded to that of a call option. When the ratio hits .75 the suggests that fear is dominating as traders seek increased protection. Being that this is a contrary an indicator, this often marks market bottoms. Low readings, generally below 0.55, signal complacency and excessive optimism, which tend to show up near market tops. Right now, the equity put call ratio is at .54, so yeah, it’s at a level where we need to be concerned that a market top could be forming and a pullback is on the horizon. # XLY vs. XLP Something else I am monitoring is the relationship between the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) vs. Consumer Staples (XLP). XLP represents companies that sell essential goods such as food, beverages, and household products. Things everybody needs and will continue to buy in any market environment. XLY represents more discretionary spending, including companies like Amazon, Tesla, and Home Depot. These are purchases people make when they feel confident in their finances. When XLY outperforms XLP, it signals a risk on environment. Consumers are spending freely, and that is typically bullish for the economy and the market. When XLP starts to outperform XLY, it suggests consumers are becoming more cautious and shifting spending toward necessities. That defensive rotation can be an early warning sign, even if the broader market is still climbing. See Chart... [ We are now seeing signs that Staples are beginning to outperform Discretionary. That shift does not mean a selloff is about to happen. Markets can continue rising for weeks even as these internal warning signals build. However, it does tell us that defensive positioning may be quietly increasing under the surface. As of late January 2026, XLP has shown noticeably stronger performance year to date compared with XLY. When you combine that with a put/call ratio hovering near complacent levels, it suggests the market may be on a short leash where the risks are rising. Most people probably don’t even know what I’m talking about when I say the Gann window from February 9-11 is quickly approaching, but this is generally an inflection point where markets turn around. You should digest this information however you wish. There’s no reason to jump to conclusions one way or the other, but as traders we should consider that conditions are shifting and that being a little more defensive heading into February, which is generally the second worst trading month of the year and one of only two months that has negative returns over the last 80 years, is simply good financial positioning.",

      "selftext_processed": "Back in early October I made a post claiming that QQQ with top out at about $ 637 most people said I was crazy then ironically that was the exact spot it corrected weeks later . Here we are three months later and we are just about at that level again . So now what With the recent batch of earnings it does appear the market is building strength but there are a few signs that underlying market weakness is continuing to build . Maybe we top out here or maybe resistance breaks only to produce a throw over which is common on the fifth wave of an Elliott structure . Other issues I ’ m seeing… Liquidity Liquidity is the first and most important piece of the puzzle . Liquidity is essentially the fuel that drives financial markets . A perfect example of this was during Covid when the government stimulus helped power a major rally . On the other hand when the liquidity dries up markets often struggle even if fundamentals are strong . Many traders don ’ t look at liquidity at all others only focus on if the Fed is engaging in quantitative easing or quantitative tightening but that ’ s only part of the story . Another important tool is the Federal Reserve ’ s Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement facility commonly referred to as RRP . This program allows large financial institutions especially money market funds to park cash at the Fed overnight in exchange for Treasury securities . Last year markets held up better than expected during the quantitative tightening phase because money was flowing out of the RRP and back into the financial system . Essentially RRP acted as a cushion against the quantitative tightening process . Take a look at RRP now… That cushion is now essentially gone . Balances in the RRP facility have fallen from roughly $ 2.5 trillion in 2023 to only about a billion today . That is essentially nothing_When the tank is empty it becomes concerning . The large pool of idle cash that could flow back into the system is now gone and so is the excess fuel that can power the market forward this is generally negative for stocks . PutCall Ratio One of my favorite sentiment indicators and one of the indicators that is often overlooked is the putcall ratio . This indicator compares the volume of put options traded to that of a call option . When the ratio hits .75 the suggests that fear is dominating as traders seek increased protection . Being that this is a contrary an indicator this often marks market bottoms . Low readings generally below 0.55 signal complacency and excessive optimism which tend to show up near market tops . Right now the equity put call ratio is at .54 so yeah it ’ s at a level where we need to be concerned that a market top could be forming and a pullback is on the horizon . XLY vs. XLP Something else I am monitoring is the relationship between the Consumer Discretionary XLY vs. Consumer Staples XLP . XLP represents companies that sell essential goods such as food beverages and household products . Things everybody needs and will continue to buy in any market environment . XLY represents more discretionary spending including companies like Amazon Tesla and Home Depot . These are purchases people make when they feel confident in their finances . When XLY outperforms XLP it signals a risk on environment . Consumers are spending freely and that is typically bullish for the economy and the market . When XLP starts to outperform XLY it suggests consumers are becoming more cautious and shifting spending toward necessities . That defensive rotation can be an early warning sign even if the broader market is still climbing . See Chart ... We are now seeing signs that Staples are beginning to outperform Discretionary . That shift does not_mean a selloff is about to happen . Markets can continue rising for weeks even as these internal warning signals build . However it does tell us that defensive positioning may be quietly increasing under the surface . As of late January 2026 XLP has shown noticeably stronger performance year to date compared with XLY . When you combine that with a putcall ratio hovering near complacent levels it suggests the market may be on a short leash where the risks are rising . Most people probably don ’ t even know what I ’ m talking about when I say the Gann window from February 911 is quickly approaching but this is generally an inflection point where markets turn around . You should digest this information however you wish . There ’ s no_reason to jump to conclusions one way or the other but as traders we should consider that conditions are shifting and that being a little more defensive heading into February which is generally the second worst trading month of the year and one of only two months that has negative returns over the last 80 years is simply good financial positioning ."

      "selftext": "I think everyone forgot how much the USD crashed from 2006 to 2011. Why? Fed Rate Cuts: The unfolding credit crisis in the U.S. weakened the dollar. As the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates in September 2007 to manage the crisis, the dollar lost its yield advantage, making the euro more attractive to investors. Interest Rate Differentials: While the Fed was cutting rates, the European Central Bank (ECB) was, at times, raising or maintaining higher rates, driving up the value of the euro. Weak U.S. Economic Data: Slowing U.S. economic growth, particularly in the first quarter of 2007, reinforced fears of a widening economic disparity between Europe and the United States. Diversification Away from the Dollar: Central banks and investors were increasingly looking for alternatives to the dollar, with the euro serving as the major alternative, boosting its demand. Eurozone Economic Growth: Robust economic recovery in Germany and overall growth in the eurozone strengthened the currency, with the region's financial markets showing increased vibrancy. Keep adding my friends. Most importantly, keep your jobs if a massive crash happens, but if you’re smart you’ll profit handsomely from this in 5-10 years.",

      "selftext_processed": "I think everyone forgot how much the USD crashed from 2006 to 2011 . Why Fed Rate Cuts The unfolding credit crisis in the U.S. weakened the dollar . As the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates in September 2007 to manage the crisis the dollar lost its yield advantage making the euro more attractive to investors . Interest Rate Differentials While the Fed was cutting rates the European Central Bank ECB was at times raising or maintaining higher rates driving up the value of the euro . Weak U.S. Economic Data Slowing U.S. economic growth particularly in the first quarter of 2007 reinforced fears of a widening economic disparity between Europe and the United States . Diversification Away from the Dollar Central banks and investors were increasingly looking for alternatives to the dollar with the euro serving as the major alternative boosting its demand . Eurozone Economic Growth Robust economic recovery in Germany and overall growth in the eurozone strengthened the currency with the regions financial markets showing increased vibrancy . Keep adding my friends . Most importantly keep your jobs if a massive crash happens but if you ’ re smart you ’ ll profit handsomely from this in 510 years ."

      "selftext": "January is almost over, which makes this a decent point to reflect on how 2026 investing goals are holding up after the initial planning phase. Many investors start the year with clear intentions, but after a few weeks in, market noise and real-life constraints tend to test those plans. Curious how this is playing out for others: * Are you still aligned with the goals you set at the start of the year? * Have you already adjusted your strategy based on new information or constraints? * Or did you realize some goals weren’t realistic and reset entirely? From an investing perspective, where is your current focus leaning? * increasing consistency / discipline * reducing risk or exposure * building cash or dry powder * simplifying portfolio structure * reassessing overall strategy There’s no single “correct” path, but early reflection often prevents bigger mistakes later in the year. Interested to hear how others are thinking about this now that January is nearly behind us.",

      "selftext": "Following a lot of the madness lately can be infuriating: civil unrest, Mr Miyagi's Tariffs on Tariffs off, Greenland invasion..or not. *\\*And in part as outrageous as they are, there's a good reason they dominate the headlines to allow the structural financial re-engineering required to proceed without the mass public truly noticing.\\** I’ve taken a position in FXY because I’m betting on a fundamental regime change where the interests of Washington and Tokyo are finding their shared sweet spot. My thesis is built on a rare alignment: US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants a weaker dollar to juice American reshoring as questionable as this methodology may be, while PM Sanae Takaichi desperately needs a stronger Yen to kill the import inflation that’s becoming a political liability and domestic cost of living crisis issue. I’ve intentionally sidestepped the Bond dump risks inherent in Japanese Government Bond (JGB) funds, choosing FXY as the cleanest, most surgical tool to capture the Yen’s recovery. The alternative is straight Forex trading of course. The market is slowly validating the move, with this week’s Rate Checks acting as a warning light for a coordinated central bank push. In light of this, I feel we may be seeing a Fed End-Run where, rather than letting Japan dump Treasuries and spike US yields, the Fed is printing USD to buy Yen on Japan's behalf. This weakens the Dollar and strengthens the Yen without breaking the bond market and tanking the reputation of Treasurys. The recent velocity of the USD/JPY, which has already move from 159 down toward 152 in a matter of days, is the first indicator that the massive carry trade is beginning to unwind. The cryptocurrency pullback recently experienced is typical of high-risk positions being first to get trimmed when liquidity tightens, as capital is pulled out of highest-to-lowest risk stocks, and best runner profit margins are secured. In terms of targets, my target for FXY is a realistic $69-72 per share. After factoring in the fund’s internal decay (representing roughly 9,180 Yen per share), this price reflects a goldilocks exchange rate of roughly 132-130 USD/JPY. This is an asymmetrical bet on a structural global shift. If a sharp dump of the stock market actually hits in 2026, FXY and the Yen become a runner. Personally, I would stay away from leveraged ETPs due to increased decay over medium and longer terms, over anything past a multi-day trade. I'm still in several undervalued stocks, and plan to hold through a downturn, but have trimmed some high runners such as UAMY, and increased FXY as my hedge going into a turbulent 2026.

      "selftext_processed": "Following a lot of the madness lately can be infuriating civil unrest Mr Miyagis Tariffs on Tariffs off Greenland invasion .. or not_And in part as outrageous as they are theres a good reason they dominate the headlines to allow the structural financial reengineering required to proceed without the mass public truly noticing . I ’ ve taken a position in FXY because I ’ m betting on a fundamental regime change where the interests of Washington and Tokyo are finding their shared sweet spot . My thesis is built on a rare alignment US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants a weaker dollar to juice American reshoring as questionable as this methodology may be while PM Sanae Takaichi desperately needs a stronger Yen to kill the import inflation that ’ s becoming a political liability and domestic cost of living crisis issue . I ’ ve intentionally sidestepped the Bond dump risks inherent in Japanese Government Bond JGB funds choosing FXY as the cleanest most surgical tool to capture the Yen ’ s recovery . The alternative is straight Forex trading of course . The market is slowly validating the move with this week ’ s Rate Checks acting as a warning light for a coordinated central bank push . In light of this I feel we may be seeing a Fed EndRun where rather than letting Japan dump Treasuries and spike US yields the Fed is printing USD to buy Yen on Japans behalf . This weakens the Dollar and strengthens the Yen without breaking the bond market and tanking the reputation of Treasurys . The recent velocity of the USDJPY which has already move from 159 down toward 152 in a matter of days is the first indicator that the massive carry trade is beginning to unwind . The cryptocurrency pullback recently experienced is typical of highrisk positions being first to get trimmed when liquidity tightens as capital is pulled out of highesttolowest risk stocks and best runner profit margins are secured . In terms of targets my target for FXY is a realistic $ 6972 per share . After factoring in the fund ’ s internal decay representing roughly 9180 Yen per share this price reflects a goldilocks exchange rate of roughly 132130 USDJPY . This is an asymmetrical bet on a structural global shift . If a sharp dump of the stock market actually hits in 2026 FXY and the Yen become a runner . Personally I would stay away from leveraged ETPs due to increased decay over medium and longer terms over anything past a multiday trade . Im still in several undervalued stocks and plan to hold through a downturn but have trimmed some high runners such as UAMY and increased FXY as my hedge going into a turbulent 2026 . LFG 🍀🥸 godspeed good luck all"

      "selftext": "Is anyone else getting nervous? This seems like some sort of global systemic failure. * The dollar dropped a significant 1% the other day to its weakest level in four years [ * Japanese bonds have been dropping on major sell offs, signally a crisis in the yen [ * Both Japan and USA are tied at the hip financially, and both experiencing sovereign debt issues with massive debt to GDP ratios. Neither wants to pay higher interest rates on such massive debt. * Strengthening the yen means selling off US treasuries at a time the US can least afford it * The popular \"yen carry\" trade relies on a consistent relationship between yen-dollar value and respective interest rates on debt, which could be in jeopardy in a currency crisis [ * Gold spiked 4% today during Asian trading hours. That's a big move for gold and could be a warning sign * Add to that Trump chaos and a push for easy money fed policies post Jerome Powell, that's further pressure on the US dollar and bond market Overall it looks like a day of reckoning is coming. Not sure exactly what or when, but it's looking nasty. Any predictions?",

The dollar dropped a significant 1 % the other day to its weakest level in four years Japanese bonds have been dropping on major sell offs signally a crisis in the yen Both Japan and USA are tied at the hip financially and both experiencing sovereign debt issues with massive debt to GDP ratios . Neither_wants to pay higher interest rates on such massive debt . Strengthening the yen means selling off US treasuries at a time the US can least afford it The popular yen carry trade relies on a consistent relationship between yendollar value and respective interest rates on debt which could be in jeopardy in a currency crisis Gold spiked 4 % today during Asian trading hours . Thats a big move for gold and could be a warning sign Add to that Trump chaos and a push for easy money fed policies post Jerome Powell thats further pressure on the US dollar and bond market Overall it looks like a day of reckoning is coming . Not_sure exactly what or when but its looking nasty . Any predictions"

      "title": "The Block (SQ) stock risk assessment :",
      "selftext": "I’ve been working on a tool to automate risk analysis specifically to catch red flags that often get buried in 10-Ks and other news. I usually run it on companies I’m eyeing to see if I missed any structural risks. I recently ran it on Block (SQ) given the recent volatility and the \"AI pivot and Crypto\" narrative. While the stock has momentum, the tool surfaced some deep fundamental disconnects that go beyond the usual headlines. I wanted to share the 4 biggest risks it flagged to see if you guys think these are valid concerns or if the market is rightfully ignoring them. 1. The \"Value Destruction\" Gap (ROIC vs. WACC) This was the loudest signal. This was flagged a massive spread between return and cost: ROIC (Return on Invested Capital): \\\\\\~0.76% WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): \\\\\\~8.21% Despite reporting accounting profits, the business is technically destroying shareholder value on every dollar invested right now. Operational returns aren't covering the cost of capital. Usually, you see this in dying industries, not \"growth\" fintechs. Is this just temporary due to the restructuring, or is the core payments business losing efficiency? 2. Cash Flow Quality: Organic or Accounting Magic? Headline Operating Cash Flow looks incredible: jumping from 101M to 1.7B (2024). The Red Flag: The tool flagged that this wasn't driven purely by higher sales. It was driven by a sharp contraction in working capital. Receivables dropped from $7.19B → $5.67B. Payables fell from $141M → $118M. Retained Earnings swung wildly from -528M to +2.3B. This suggests the cash flow boom is largely \"one-off\" balance sheet timing (squeezing customers/suppliers) rather than a permanent improvement in earnings power. 3. The $11.4 Billion Goodwill Overhang Goodwill: $11.4B Intangibles: $1.4B Total: \\\\\\~35% of Total Assets. With the company pivoting focus toward Bitcoin and AI, and away from legacy integrations, the tool flagged a high risk of impairment. If the acquisitions that make up that $11B (like Afterpay) underperform, we could see a massive writedown that wipes out reported equity. 4. Borrowing to Buy Back Stock The financing activities section shows a contradiction. Long-term debt jumped from $4.97B to $6.4B. Simultaneously, they spent \\\\\\~$1.17B on equity repayments/buybacks. Leveraging up the balance sheet to buy back stock while ROIC is 0.76% seems like questionable capital allocation. Conclusion: The tool paints a picture of a company that is optically improving cash flow through working capital adjustments while the underlying capital efficiency (ROIC) is surprisingly weak. For those tracking SQ: Do you view the ROIC/WACC spread as a dealbreaker, or is it a lagging indicator that will catch up as the layoffs/restructuring fully take effect?",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been working on a tool to automate risk analysis specifically to catch red flags that often get buried in 10Ks and other news . I usually run it on companies I ’ m eyeing to see if I missed any structural risks . I recently ran it on Block SQ given the recent volatility and the AI pivot and Crypto narrative . While the stock has momentum the tool surfaced some deep fundamental disconnects that go beyond the usual headlines . I wanted to share the 4 biggest risks it flagged to see if you guys think these are valid concerns or if the market is rightfully ignoring them . 1 . The Value Destruction Gap ROIC vs. WACC This was the loudest signal . This was flagged a massive spread between return and cost ROIC Return on Invested Capital 0.76 % WACC Weighted Average Cost of Capital 8.21 % Despite reporting accounting profits the business is technically destroying shareholder value on every dollar invested right now . Operational returns arent covering the cost of capital . Usually you see this in dying industries not_growth fintechs . Is this just temporary due to the restructuring or is the core payments business losing efficiency 2 . Cash Flow Quality Organic or Accounting Magic Headline Operating Cash Flow looks incredible jumping from 101M to 1.7B 2024 . The Red Flag The tool flagged that this wasnt driven purely by higher sales . It was driven by a sharp contraction in working capital . Receivables dropped from $ 7.19B → $ 5.67B . Payables fell from $ 141M → $ 118M . Retained Earnings swung wildly from 528M to 2.3B . This suggests the cash flow boom is largely oneoff balance sheet timing squeezing customerssuppliers rather than a permanent improvement in earnings power . 3 . The $ 11.4 Billion Goodwill Overhang Goodwill $ 11.4B Intangibles $ 1.4B Total 35 % of Total Assets . With the company pivoting focus toward Bitcoin and AI and away from legacy integrations the tool flagged a high risk of impairment . If the acquisitions that make up that $ 11B like Afterpay underperform we could see a massive writedown that wipes out reported equity . 4 . Borrowing to Buy Back Stock The financing activities section shows a contradiction . Longterm debt jumped from $ 4.97B to $ 6.4B . Simultaneously they spent $ 1.17B on equity repaymentsbuybacks . Leveraging up the balance sheet to buy back stock while ROIC is 0.76 % seems like questionable capital allocation . Conclusion The tool paints a picture of a company that is optically improving cash flow through working capital adjustments while the underlying capital efficiency ROIC is surprisingly weak . For those tracking SQ Do you view the ROICWACC spread as a dealbreaker or is it a lagging indicator that will catch up as the layoffsrestructuring fully take effect"

META, MSFT, AAPL, next week AMZN, AMD and more all reporting Q4 2025 earnings. I think despite all the political and trade turmoil, big tech is doing better than just fine, they are still booming. META is expected to post an increasing profit in Q4 of $21B from $20.8B, YoY. CapEx from AI is what is making this increase so small, but I believe that to be priced in at this point when it fell below 600 last year. (although this might raise concerns for some). The standout number to me is the expected revenue of $58.45B from $48.39B, YoY. A staggering 20% increase in revenue YoY is what catches my eye that META is undervalued right now. Estimated Q4 adjusted eps at $9.03. And this time they won't miss due to a one time tax. All the analysts are coming in with price targets around 800 or above for META as well. To me, all this reads as a company ready to reclaim its proper valuation. With some good guidance from Zuck, I am setting a personal price target/option exit at $720. I bought 24 of these METU calls today around $32.30 with an exit plan of $41-$43. Option Contracts: 02/13 METU 32 C \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ EDIT: sold my options for $16k P&L: $9k",

META MSFT AAPL next week AMZN AMD and more all reporting Q4 2025 earnings . I think despite all the political and trade turmoil big tech is doing better than just fine they are still booming . META is expected to post an increasing profit in Q4 of $ 21B from $ 20.8B YoY . CapEx from AI is what is making this increase so small but I believe that to be priced in at this point when it fell below 600 last year . although this might raise concerns for some . The standout number to me is the expected revenue of $ 58.45B from $ 48.39B YoY . A staggering 20 % increase in revenue YoY is what catches my eye that META is undervalued right now . Estimated Q4 adjusted eps at $ 9.03 . And this time they wont miss due to a one time tax . All the analysts are coming in with price targets around 800 or above for META as well . To me all this reads as a company ready to reclaim its proper valuation . With some good guidance from Zuck I am setting a personal price targetoption exit at $ 720 . I bought 24 of these METU calls today around $ 32.30 with an exit plan of $ 41 $ 43 . Option Contracts 0213 METU 32 C ____________ EDIT sold my options for $ 16k PL $ 9k"

Yes they’re currently losing money but I think the market is missing the ramp up in revenue growth this year as they march towards profitability. They already have trucks on the ground in Texas running loads with plans to have more this year running loads into Phoenix among other places. Their tech is way ahead of anyone else’s.

      "selftext": "I have growing concerns regarding the current state of the US Dollar and its potential to trigger a global recession. The current administration has openly prioritized a weak dollar policy, evidenced by a 15% depreciation against the Euro since the term began. This is compounded by political pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to 1% and rising geopolitical friction with the EU, which risks a selloff of US Treasuries. My thesis suggests two likely, yet negative, outcomes: **The Path of Non-Intervention** If the dollar continues to devalue unchecked, we risk a surge in commodity prices (already underway), leading to cost-push inflation. While oil supply may mitigate some shocks, a severe spike could threaten the solvency of import-dependent nations. Furthermore, this dynamic encourages \"currency wars,\" where trading partners devalue their own currencies to remain competitive. This erosion of trust could destroy international trade, ultimately leading to stagflation and recession. **The Path of Delayed Intervention** If the US government eventually intervenes, it will likely be a reactive measure taken too late. This would force the Federal Reserve to enact drastic measures, similar to the \"Volcker Shock\" hiking rates aggressively to curb inflation. Alternatively, they might attempt to absorb massive amounts of liquidity. Both approaches would freeze capital expenditure and tighten the economy so severely that a crisis becomes inevitable. I'm struggling to see how the current narrative of the administration is avoiding to change their path for the Dollar, I understand how a small devaluation makes you more competitive when it comes to international trade, I feel we have reached the point where the constant weakening of the Dollar against all other currencies stops favoring the US and just starts destroying the global economy. I am seeking feedback on this assessment: Is this thesis economically sound, or am I overestimating the risks? I basically want to hear the rest of the people so I can atleast start seeing other points of views on how the US's narrative might make sense.",

      "selftext": "I have traded mostly stocks, ETFs and Options last year (around 200 executed orders in 2025) with a reasonable level of success (in a bull market anyone is a hero). Reviewing the trades it became clear I let my losers run too long and cut some winners short too early. I have set myself a goal of being more disciplined in trading this year and came up with the following strategy: # Overview: * Goal: 20%/year target return * Time horizon: 5 years * Max Drawdown: 25% # Additional constrains: * No single trade above 1% of portfolio total * Per-Ticker Limits: 10% single stock/20% single ETF * Asset type concentration limits: Stocks: 35%/ETFs: 45%/Options: 20% # Sector Allocations (soft limits): * Information Technology: 35% * Energy: 5% * Large Blend: 30% (mostly for indexed ETFs - VOO, etc...) * Other sectors: 30% # How I plan on implement the rules: 1. All assets held must have a stop-loss/trailing stop-loss set at 15%-20% of either current price or entry price (use TA to identify support levels near the trigger value) 2. Option count against underlying ticker concentration - *100 Shares of NVDA + 1 short Put NVDA Contract = 200 share commitment.* 3. If total stock allocation is met, use LEAPS as stock replacement up to the 20% limit As I'm investing across a range of account types (401K Traditional and Brokerage, Roth IRA, Taxable Brokerage, HSA), there are differences in types of operations I can make in each one of them. It gets a bit complicated but I try to use LEAPS across Roth IRA and Taxable Brokerage, while I can Wheel assets on the 401K Brokerage. I need to stick with the selection of mutual funds in 401K traditional. I don't understand Options enough to operate multi-leg strategies so I don't play with them. # Current portfolio: Current stocks held in descending order of value: NVDA, PLTR, NOW, SMCI, CALM, GOOG, IREN, ADBE, OKTA, FISV, SPT Current ETFs held in descending order of value: IWB, VOO, MGK, SMH Current open option contracts: Long LEAPS on the following underlying: NVO, NVDA, PLTR, NOK, KLAR, KVUE/A few Covered Calls on SMH, NOW, IREN, OKTA # Feedback Request Before I implement the strategy and limits, I would like to get feedback on the overall framework. Specific questions: \\- Should I tighten up the stop-loss limit on Stocks/ETFs and use the slack to broaden up the stop-loss limits for LEAPS/Options - keeping the 25% drawdown total? \\- Should I consider stashing 5% os total invested in corporate bonds (ETF along the lines of IGIB) as dry powder to buy significant dips? \\- Any glaring holes or immediate improvements to be made? \\- Anyone operates under a similar framework and can share experience?

Her: \"Why dad?\" Me: \"Well, It supposedly dropped due to the kids using it less\" Her: \"But dad every single person i know plays Roblox and everyone is addicted to it. <Insert friends name here> even SPENDS REAL MONEY on it!!\" Me: \"I know that, so can not really explain it, but let us just hope your friends start to spend more money on it haha.

      "selftext": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) - a stock that has burned Retail Traders and Wall Street analysts, has confirmed Q2 earnings for 2/3/26 after market close. They are forecasted to announce revenue $10-11 B and EPS $.45-$.54. At a $18B market cap, this is very attractive valuation for an AI stock, even an AI stock on the wrong end of the chip business. However, Wall Street does not believe a word they are saying. After 2 years of earnings misses and declining margins, SMCI is poised to explode either up or down. My completely uneducated and NOT FINANCIAL advice suggests SMCI stock is going to either $15 or $50 in the next two weeks. Acting on this hypothesis, I have opened a 2-13-26 dated $30 straddle position. Please balance your risk and reward and diversify your stock portfolio.",

I remember when semiconductor stocks were being talked about everywhere in 2016 (when they were unknown and lowkey) all the nerds were posting legit analysis about DRAM prices, implementation in various hardware products, how it would track with the crypto boom due to CPUs/GPUs, etc. seriously, how is Reddit goin to make money? the ads are irrelevant and from no name companies. I see the same posts reposted 5x a week to karma farm “whats the biggest regret of your life” lmfao i love Reddit (the subreddit niches helped me alot in my career and early life) and normally buy what use, but the concerns are genuine. AI and bot posts are way more common, constantly reposts of the same shit, and this place in general is a liberal echo box which will deter the masses downvote all you want but this is a public company now, to capture the young demographic entirely I’m sure they don’t want to log-in everyday and see a post on [r/all](/r/all/) about ONLY vaccines and left wing propoganda. Why the fuck is the number one post some corny picture of a soilder Punching a nazi? it should be something trendy and relevant like that idiot clavicular EDIT: do you guys SEE what i MEAN? isnt the controversy and polarizing opinion of MINE getting the JUICES FLOWING and real human emotion involved thus higher comments and replies in this post? there should be 100,000 of me, i cant do this alone. this is what reddit should turn into, not an echobox full of censoring, not AI slop, not 10 posts a day about why i should get vaccinated. i want to log into [r/all]( one day and see dslr pics of a trump rally and another being a post about how those who didnt get the covid vaccine will die in 5 years. im tired of logging in everyday and seeing the same post \"people in their 30s, what do you regret in your 20s\" or ONLY \"Study: why letting my 12 year old son chop his weiner off and change genders will reduce his depression rate\" [u/spez]( hire me i know how to get the job done, let me take this bad boy to $1k a share",

      "title": "Does flexibility meaningfully improve long-term portfolio outcomes, or is full investment still optimal?",
      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over extended periods, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing, drawdown deployment, or reduced forced selling during stress periods. While this approach may lower expected returns, it could potentially improve risk-adjusted outcomes and reduce forced selling during market stress, depending on how it is implemented. From a structural perspective, this raises a broader question: should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management, or simply an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? For those focused on long horizons, how do you think about this tradeoff in practice? Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework, or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested?",

      "selftext_processed": "In longterm portfolio construction being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments . Over extended periods idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark . At the same time some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing drawdown deployment or reduced forced selling during stress periods . While this approach may lower expected returns it could potentially improve riskadjusted outcomes and reduce forced selling during market stress depending on how it is implemented . From a structural perspective this raises a broader question should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management or simply an inefficiency that longterm investors should minimize For those focused on long horizons how do you think about this tradeoff in practice Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested"

The main goal is: Capital should stay safe No stock market or risky investments Monthly income of around ₹80k–₹1 lakh to manage regular expenses Minimal monitoring and no stress Basically looking for something stable where the money stays intact and generates a predictable monthly income. Just wanted to understand from people here: Is this kind of monthly income realistic without taking risk? If yes, what kind of options should we look at? If not, what would be a sensible expectation from a completely safe setup? Would really appreciate advice from anyone who has dealt with retirement planning or similar situations. Thanks.",

      "selftext": "While any specific thoughts on the individual stock (CENX/Century Aluminum) are welcome, I'm also/more broadly interested in how folks handle your unexpected wins that wildly exceed your expectations especially in the realm of small caps where you readily realize you just got lucky. FWIW, my brokerage account I used for individual stock picks is a pretty tiny portion of my overall portfolio -- I am no pro, nor any kind of day trader and mostly, I stick with large/mega caps. Still, I always told myself \"If you can't keep pace with the S&P, you've just got an expensive hobby\". Over 6 years now - I've held my own or better, thanks largely to getting in early on NVDA and standard stalwarts like AMZN and AAPL. Anyway, I don't usually bother with small caps - but \\~3 years ago, I read an interesting article in Kiplinger about potential under the radar beneficiaries of the 2021/2022 infrastructure/manufacturing bills. CENX was one of the names mentioned. I read more - they had some aggressive expansion plans, including some new tech/methods. I did - as I always try to do - pored over the 10-K/10-Qs and thought the finances looked solid. Bought in further in 2024 - quite clear no matter who won the election, such public investment wasn't going away. I wouldn't ask this sort of question about large caps, but small caps... oy. Not a charts guy, but short% creeping towards 20%. CENX missed earnings throughout 2025, but still had an unbelievable year price-wise. Sector averages on P/E, now even growth? Don't look good. And worst of all? \"Materials\" is just not a sector I'm familiar with. My *gut* \\- every ounce of it - says take the money and run... I'm now, total cash basis - up nearly 500%, long on all positions. What was really a pretty small total investment has suddenly become real money. However, my gut isn't always very smart. And I'm really just a \"buy-and-hold\" guy. AND - as the title says, I believe in \"cut your weeds, not your flowers\". Like I said, any specific thoughts on it are welcome -- but more broadly, ***especially*** from more seasoned investors. How and when do you decide that even your \"winners\" have exceeded expectations and you start to wonder whether its time to take the profits and reallocate to \"safer\" investments? Or - do you not? Even crashing out - the position here wouldn't hurt me in the grand scheme.",

FWIW my brokerage account I used for individual stock picks is a pretty tiny portion of my overall portfolio I am no_pro nor any kind of day trader and mostly I stick with largemega caps . Still I always told myself If you cant keep pace with the SP youve just got an expensive hobby . Over 6 years now Ive held my own or better thanks largely to getting in early on NVDA and standard stalwarts like AMZN and AAPL . Anyway I dont usually bother with small caps but 3 years ago I read an interesting article in Kiplinger about potential under the radar beneficiaries of the 20212022 infrastructuremanufacturing bills . CENX was one of the names mentioned . I read more they had some aggressive expansion plans including some new techmethods . I did as I always try to do pored over the 10K10Qs and thought the finances looked solid . Bought in further in 2024 quite clear no_matter who won the election such public investment wasnt going away . I wouldnt ask this sort of question about large caps but small caps ... oy . Not_a charts guy but short % creeping towards 20 % . CENX missed earnings throughout 2025 but still had an unbelievable year pricewise . Sector averages on PE now even growth Dont look good . And worst of all Materials is just not_a sector Im familiar with . My gut every ounce of it says take the money and run ... Im now total cash basis up nearly 500 % long on all positions . What was really a pretty small total investment has suddenly become real money . However my gut isnt always very smart . And Im really just a buyandhold guy . AND as the title says I believe in cut your weeds not_your flowers . Like I said any specific thoughts on it are welcome but more broadly especially from more seasoned investors . How and when do you decide that even your winners have exceeded expectations and you start to wonder whether its time to take the profits and reallocate to safer investments Or do you not_Even crashing out the position here wouldnt hurt me in the grand scheme ."

I wanted to buy Nasdaq futures and just hold them forever, I said we will never see these lows again. However Silver futures at the time got trounced from $35 down to $30 in 2 days, a once in a lifetime move at the time so I decided to go all in and put every penny I had into silver futures. Had about $600,000 (I am not even rich, I just had won a lot in sports betting, put it in the market and made even more) and I bought 41 Silver future contracts on a Friday for about $29.75. For that amount of futures it is $210,000 for every dollar silver moved, had it gone back up to just $35 it was 2 days ago I would up $1 million dollars but I was ready to hold it for years, I thought would get to $50 or so and make a killing..... By the time the market opened up on Sunday night the futures got crushed and opened even lower at $28 and dropped all the way to $27.54 a low that will never be seen again. At that point I was down $460,000 and all but wiped out = a few more ticks lower and it would have been a margin call and automatic sale from TD. About to go broke I said a prayer and low and behold the market rallied and not even 3 hours later I actually sold the futures at $30.02 for a $50,000 profit. I had no choice, I couldn't take the chance it dropped again and wipe me out, my dreams of holding for the long term was over. I moved on and in grand tard fashion ended up losing every single penny of that money on other futures and options trades over the next month But the killer is Silver made the move I knew would happen and is now $100+. I knew it was going back up (i thought maybe $50, never though $100), I knew I wanted to hold it forever. If I was able to hold it until now that that would be a profit of over $14 million dollars on the 41 contracts. But even worse my plan was that as I made profits I would just keep buying more futures as it went up. I would have had at least 500 contracts by now easily would have made over $100 Million dollars on this trade. And that puts me as the #1 grand tard of all the grand tards in this sub. I know it would happen, I made the trade, and I still lost all my money Have a good day",

I wanted to buy Nasdaq futures and just hold them forever I said we will never_see these lows again . However Silver futures at the time got trounced from $ 35 down to $ 30 in 2 days a once in a lifetime move at the time so I decided to go all in and put every penny I had into silver futures . Had about $ 600000 I am not_even rich I just had won a lot in sports betting put it in the market and made even more and I bought 41 Silver future contracts on a Friday for about $ 29.75 . For that amount of futures it is $ 210000 for every dollar silver moved had it gone back up to just $ 35 it was 2 days ago I would up $ 1 million dollars but I was ready to hold it for years I thought would get to $ 50 or so and make a killing ..... By the time the market opened up on Sunday night the futures got crushed and opened even lower at $ 28 and dropped all the way to $ 27.54 a low that will never_be seen again . At that point I was down $ 460000 and all but wiped out a few more ticks lower and it would have been a margin call and automatic sale from TD . About to go broke I said a prayer and low and behold the market rallied and not_even 3 hours later I actually sold the futures at $ 30.02 for a $ 50000 profit . I had no_choice I couldnt take the chance it dropped again and wipe me out my dreams of holding for the long term was over . I moved on and in grand tard fashion ended up losing every single penny of that money on other futures and options trades over the next month But the killer is Silver made the move I knew would happen and is now $ 100 . I knew it was going back up i thought maybe $ 50 never_though $ 100 I knew I wanted to hold it forever . If I was able to hold it until now that that would be a profit of over $ 14 million dollars on the 41 contracts . But even worse my plan was that as I made profits I would just keep buying more futures as it went up . I would have had at least 500 contracts by now easily would have made over $ 100 Million dollars on this trade . And that puts me as the 1 grand tard of all the grand tards in this sub . I know it would happen I made the trade and I still lost all my money Have a good day"

      "selftext": "Hey all, So, just a bit about myself & my investing journey: I'm from Hong Kong & was first introduced to investing at 13 after reading bits of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Having an older baby boomer British father who always thought stocks were \"gambling\", I struggled with the scarcity mindset that I was brought up with & had to take the longest time trying to change this mindset. I never started investing till I was about 22 back in 2020 & even then, I was a very conservative investor & only invested about US$130 a month into a unit trust fund from my bank (HSBC) - I blame my lack of financial literacy at the time as I didn't know how to open an investment account & was so hesitant to transfer money out of my bank account. (What a waste of an opportunity.) Later that year, I got thrust into the world of speculation after being asked to recommend stocks by a friend who wanted a very aggressive approach with his investing (At one point, he wanted to go all in on one stock.) As I was risk averse, I never attempted to try picking stocks with my own money & as it turned out, using Reddit as my main source of information as a retail investor, my stock picks were actually winners if I had sold them at the right time at the time - I looked into BYD, NIO, PLTR, MARA, DDD, OCGN, GME. Fast forward 5 years & my financial literacy has improved as I spent hours listening to finance podcasts & reading investing books. I've managed to put in consistently put money into VT each month & the more financial content I consume, the more I realize that I'm more geared towards being a broad index investor rather than a stock picker. I still haven't started picking stocks & I can't help but beat myself up for not taking the risk back then. The hindsight bias has been brutal & taxing to my mental health knowing how life changing the potential return could've been but anyway, would've, could've, should've, I understand Hindsight is 20/20. I still have these lingering questions at the back of my head: * Am I bad at taking risks? * How do I make of this experience when I was an absolute beginner? (Was I too harsh on myself?) * Should I even be trying to pick stocks based on Reddit advice knowing how indecisive I can be making such decisions as we all know markets are forward looking & the stock prices have the possibility of already being priced in? * How do I learn from the experience & most importantly, moving forward, how do I develop the CORRECT mindset for my investing journey & rid myself of the regret from the hindsight bias I've been struggling with for some time now? I would love all your feedback & opinions on this & would love to know if you have any stories related to this that you would be happy to share. (It would definitely help a lot!)",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey all So just a bit about myself my investing journey Im from Hong Kong was first introduced to investing at 13 after reading bits of Rich Dad Poor Dad . Having an older baby boomer British father who always thought stocks were gambling I struggled with the scarcity mindset that I was brought up with had to take the longest time trying to change this mindset . I never_started investing till I was about 22 back in 2020 even then I was a very conservative investor only invested about US $ 130 a month into a unit trust fund from my bank HSBC I blame my lack of financial literacy at the time as I didnt know how to open an investment account was so hesitant to transfer money out of my bank account . What a waste of an opportunity . Later that year I got thrust into the world of speculation after being asked to recommend stocks by a friend who wanted a very aggressive approach with his investing At one point he wanted to go all in on one stock . As I was risk averse I never_attempted to try picking stocks with my own money as it turned out using Reddit as my main source of information as a retail investor my stock picks were actually winners if I had sold them at the right time at the time I looked into BYD NIO PLTR MARA DDD OCGN GME . Fast forward 5 years my financial literacy has improved as I spent hours listening to finance podcasts reading investing books . Ive managed to put in consistently put money into VT each month the more financial content I consume the more I realize that Im more geared towards being a broad index investor rather than a stock picker . I still havent started picking stocks I cant help but beat myself up for not_taking the risk back then . The hindsight bias has been brutal taxing to my mental health knowing how life changing the potential return couldve been but anyway wouldve couldve shouldve I understand Hindsight is 2020 . I still have these lingering questions at the back of my head Am I bad at taking risks How do I make of this experience when I was an absolute beginner Was I too harsh on myself Should I even be trying to pick stocks based on Reddit advice knowing how indecisive I can be making such decisions as we all know markets are forward looking the stock prices have the possibility of already being priced in How do I learn from the experience most importantly moving forward how do I develop the CORRECT mindset for my investing journey rid myself of the regret from the hindsight bias Ive been struggling with for some time now I would love all your feedback opinions on this would love to know if you have any stories related to this that you would be happy to share . It would definitely help a lot"

      "selftext": "India's oil minister says US-India talks are \"very advanced,\" eyeing a quick sign-off. But Trump's crew is slamming 50% tariffs on Indian goods (punishing Russian oil buys) and criticizing the new EU-India \"mother of all deals.\" Is this a breakthrough or a trap that spikes China tensions and tanks EM funds? Bearish vibes strong. Even platforms like Bitget with tokenized stocks are mirroring the volatility in Indian equities amid these tariff threats. Key red flags are piling up based on fresh reports: the U.S. has already hammered India with 50% duties on certain goods, while Treasury pick Scott Bessent blasts the EU-India FTA as \"financing war against themselves\" through indirect Russia ties, and Trump's broader threats, like 100% tariffs on Canada and 25% on South Korea, could easily escalate the mess. Meanwhile, the EU-India power move, a landmark deal slashing tariffs on 96.6% of goods and boosting EU exports to India, significantly reduces U.S. leverage according to experts. This geopolitical fallout might heighten U.S.-China friction even further, putting intense pressure on emerging market ETFs like INDA and EEM through potential outflows. If it lands, it could stabilize supply chains and boost bilateral trade (currently \\~$200B), giving U.S. firms better access to India's market amid China decoupling. But experts like former trade officials say the EU deal gives India \"immediate price advantages,\" making U.S. negotiations tougher. what's your take? Is the deal a done thing, or will tariffs kill it?",

Since then I've been diversifying - etf, bonds and fu\\*\\* stock picking. And this last one is killing me. I want to buy a new house in the next 3y and I know I'm not going make a fortune from all that money... but hey, look at sandisk. What if I bought 100 shares a year ago? I decided since the beginning that I'm on the market for long term, but at the same time I lost some money for bad decisions (quantum computing, pinterest) and lost important money for my house. This thoughts are killing me. I wanted to surf the wave, make good money and leave. I have a friend who's always green - always making money - essentially surfing this market. No financial background, just surfing. I don't want that risk... but he has been soooo lucky. And I'm not. He doesn't do any company analysis. He doesn't care about earnings... on the other side, In the past 3 months I've been spending too much energy creating python scripts to analyse companies, earnings, ps ratio, dilution, etc...... too much energy. At the same time I know I'm right: focused ln the long term. But the other side is saying: you could also surf this bull marker wave and make money. And you're not. You could put money in Siemens Energy at 75€ (seriously I had the opportunity) but I didn't because I didn't know if I should. Now it's \"just\" 141€. Felling guilty, feeling I'm loosing the wave... because seems a good opportunity, and I know we don't know the future. My friend goes from the \"feeling\", and succeeded. I try to understand things and could make money, and I'm not. Feeling anxious because could making good money, an extra help for my house and I'm not. Feel lost sometimes. I don't want to beat the market, I know I can't . I'm always with yahoo finance open, tracking news and companies, trying to undertsif it's a good time to invest in a company. I don't want to be a gambler, but feel that if I would (with some money) I could have more money. beeing rich is not the main poin here.",

I did no small cap, value, or growth since I thought S&P500 and target dated fund already covers those. I didn’t do international either since the target date fund has that too. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "Here is a DD, fellow window lickers. The Europoors have an investible asset for once. The pride of the Italian construction worker & Dubai sheikh. Ferrari: $RACE The most profitable car company on earth by a % basis. Its business model, demand dynamics, and customer behavior place it closer to Hermès than to any mass-market OEM. Hermès trades at roughly fifty times trailing earnings, while Ferrari trades closer to the mid-thirties at the moment. Based on trailing EPS, a Hermès-level earnings multiple would imply a share price roughly sixty percent higher than current levels. The gap is not due to inferior fundamentals, but because the market still partially misclassifies Ferrari as an auto manufacturer rather than a luxury scarcity brand. Ferrari’s demand profile is insulated from the typical macroeconomic pressures that affect the automotive sector. The company sells to high NW buyers whose purchasing power is not meaningfully impacted by interest rates, inflation, or consumer credit conditions. For their customers, availability, allocation, and status matter far more than financing rates or monthly payment considerations, . As a result, revenue stability, pricing power, and margins behave more like high-end luxury goods than cyclical vehicles. Order books remain deep, consistently extending beyond two years. Even in cases where a model receives mixed feedback from enthusiasts, allocations sell out because buyers are playing a longer reputation game. Taking delivery of a less-desired model today increases the probability of earning a rarified allocation tomorrow. This behavior mirrors the Patek Philippe model, where customers accept less sought-after references to build credibility with the brand, and where the real product being sold is not the object itself but the access. Recent analyst downgrades tied to the rollout cadence of the F80 are reflective of short-term sentiment more than any deterioration in operational performance. Delivery expectations have shifted modestly on certain tranches, but projected units, mix, and pricing still support the broader earnings profile. F80 demand remains oversubscribed at the high end, and the release does not carry long-term revenue consequences. The temporary softness in sentiment is a function of modeling timelines rather than weakening fundamentals. The tipping point for the recent stock slide was based on an underinvestment/production reduction in EVs. This should be positive with the current political climate. Regardless, who tf wants a EV Ferrari? It should be easily priced at $500. The drawdown has stabilized with earning ahead, I’m looking for a meaningful push into the low 400 shortly.

      "selftext": "I'm seriously thinking about dumping all my Bitcoin at a loss, but I want to make sure its a good idea first. I've been holding bitcoin at roughly a 24% loss for around 6 months or more, and I'm starting to think it was a bad investment. I was expecting Bitcoin to be a hedge against possible US dollar devaluation and more continued interest in the expansion of Bitcoin investment vehicles like people being able to invest into it with their 401ks. However, Bitcoin hasn't lived up to my expectations. I'll be honest, mostly I invested in Bitcoin because the chart was going up into the right, and up into the right is good lol, but now it isn't. Silver and gold are doing the work of hedging against US dollar devaluation, mainly with major world banks buying it up. The major banks have more power than every day people like you and I, so I can't go against their game. Supposedly JP Morgan is keeping the price of Bitcoin down with them shorting Microstrategy stock (I don't understand this too well I could be wrong). More and more I'm thinking Warren Buffet was right on Bitcoin. What intrinsic value does Bitcoin have? What other major functions can you do with Bitcoin besides buying and holding and then selling later? I know its obviously a currency, but the only other major use case I know of for Bitcoin is buying drugs off the dark web. At least with gold and silver, you can melt it down and make electronics and jewelry. Maybe things will change in the future and Bitcoin will become the world reserve currency replacing the dollar, since you can't really buy goods and services with silver and gold. But then again, maybe someone will come up with another electronic coin backed by gold and silver. I want to know what you guys think. I might have some misconstrued views on Bitcoin and may not be seeing the whole picture.",

Ive been holding bitcoin at roughly a 24 % loss for around 6 months or more and Im starting to think it was a bad investment . I was expecting Bitcoin to be a hedge against possible US dollar devaluation and more continued interest in the expansion of Bitcoin investment vehicles like people being able to invest into it with their 401ks . However Bitcoin hasnt lived up to my expectations . Ill be honest mostly I invested in Bitcoin because the chart was going up into the right and up into the right is good lol but now it isnt . Silver and gold are doing the work of hedging against US dollar devaluation mainly with major world banks buying it up . The major banks have more power than every day people like you and I so I cant go against their game . Supposedly JP Morgan is keeping the price of Bitcoin down with them shorting Microstrategy stock I dont understand this too well I could be wrong . More and more Im thinking Warren Buffet was right on Bitcoin . What intrinsic value does Bitcoin have What other major functions can you do with Bitcoin besides buying and holding and then selling later I know its obviously a currency but the only other major use case I know of for Bitcoin is buying drugs off the dark web . At least with gold and silver you can melt it down and make electronics and jewelry . Maybe things will change in the future and Bitcoin will become the world reserve currency replacing the dollar since you cant really buy goods and services with silver and gold . But then again maybe someone will come up with another electronic coin backed by gold and silver . I want to know what you guys think . I might have some misconstrued views on Bitcoin and may not_be seeing the whole picture ."

      "selftext": "Been digging into Alphabet's financials and wanted to share some findings that go beyond the surface level bullish narrative. This isn't investment advice, just my analysis. The headline numbers look great: Net income up 36% YoY to $100.1B Operating cash flow jumped to $125.3B Stock up \\\\\\\\\\\\\\~65% in 2025 But here's what's getting buried: 1. Free Cash Flow is compressing despite higher earnings CapEx jumped 63% ($32.3B → $52.5B) while cash on hand stayed flat at $23.5B. Net income is up, but FCF margin is declining. That's a red flag most screens won't catch. 2. Hidden leverage nobody talks about Long-term debt looks manageable at $10.9B. But capital lease obligations are $14.6B more than the debt itself. All those data centers aren't free. 3. Liquidity is shifting long-term at the worst time Short-term investments dropped from $86.9B to $72.2B while long-term investments increased. They're locking up liquidity right when CapEx is peaking. 4. AI might cannibalize before it monetizes Here's the contrarian take: AI-generated answers bypass traditional ad clicks. Investors are pricing AI as additive revenue, but it could redistribute value within Google's ecosystem rather than expand it. 5. Receivables growing at revenue pace Receivables up 9% YoY. If those AI/Cloud contracts have delayed payment milestones, working capital strain could hit during any downturn. 6. Governance risk is real Dual-class structure means founders maintain control regardless of what shareholders want. Limited influence on capital allocation or dividend policy. Finding this stuff took hours of digging through filings. If you're a value investor tired of fragmented research and information overload causing you to miss risk signals. There are tools to surface these kinds of non-obvious risks. Anyone else concerned about the CapEx ramp or see it differently?",

      "selftext_processed": "Been digging into Alphabets financials and wanted to share some findings that go beyond the surface level bullish narrative . This isnt investment advice just my analysis . The headline numbers look great Net income up 36 % YoY to $ 100.1B Operating cash flow jumped to $ 125.3B Stock up 65 % in 2025 But heres whats getting buried 1 . Free Cash Flow is compressing despite higher earnings CapEx jumped 63 % $ 32.3B → $ 52.5B while cash on hand stayed flat at $ 23.5B . Net income is up but FCF margin is declining . Thats a red flag most screens wont catch . 2 . Hidden leverage nobody_talks about Longterm debt looks manageable at $ 10.9B . But capital lease obligations are $ 14.6B more than the debt itself . All those data centers arent free . 3 . Liquidity is shifting longterm at the worst time Shortterm investments dropped from $ 86.9B to $ 72.2B while longterm investments increased . Theyre locking up liquidity right when CapEx is peaking . 4 . AI might cannibalize before it monetizes Heres the contrarian take AIgenerated answers bypass traditional ad clicks . Investors are pricing AI as additive revenue but it could redistribute value within Googles ecosystem rather than expand it . 5 . Receivables growing at revenue pace Receivables up 9 % YoY . If those AICloud contracts have delayed payment milestones working capital strain could hit during any downturn . 6 . Governance risk is real Dualclass structure means founders maintain control regardless of what shareholders want . Limited influence on capital allocation or dividend policy . Finding this stuff took hours of digging through filings . If youre a value investor tired of fragmented research and information overload causing you to miss risk signals . There are tools to surface these kinds of nonobvious risks . Anyone else concerned about the CapEx ramp or see it differently"

      "selftext": "Built a data platform as a side project. Used it to analyse sector rotation patterns across 27 years of S&P 500 sector ETF data. --- **Methodology** - **Data:** S&P 500 Sector SPDR ETFs (XLK, XLE, XLF, XLV, XLY, XLP, XLI, XLB, XLU, XLRE, XLC) - **Period:** 1999-2026 (XLRE from 2015, XLC from 2018) - **Approach:** Rank all sectors by annual return, track year-over-year transitions, count reversals **Why ETFs, not stock averages:** Market-cap weighted. A $3T company has more influence than a $100M micro-cap. I initially used FMP's sector_performance data (simple averages) but got garbage. +73% single-day sector returns from micro-cap noise. ETFs reflect actual investable returns. --- **Results** | Metric | Count | |:-------|:------| | Total year-over-year transitions | 246 | | Bottom-3 → Top-3 next year | 27 (11%) | | Top-3 → Bottom-3 next year | 34 (14%) | | Major reversals (either direction) | 61 (25%) | No sector stayed #1 for more than 2 consecutive years. --- **Recent rankings (2024-2026)** | Year | #1 | #2 | #3 | Worst | |:-----|:---|:---|:---|:------| | 2024 | Comm Services (+36%) | Financials | Consumer Disc | Materials (0%) | | 2025 | Technology (+25%) | Comm Services | Industrials | Utilities (-43%) | | 2026 YTD | Materials (+7%) | Energy | Consumer Staples | Financials (-2%) | Materials: worst in 2024, leading 2026 YTD.

A family is considering allocating $1–2 million into a long-term investment vehicle with the objective of generating a sustainable \\~5% annual return while preserving capital.

Background is that I would like to secure my family's future and organize some sort of trust fund or something like that so we would have some sort of passive income. I now use CDs but the rates are not great and they will probably go lower. I want to keep 5% at min, and I would like to increase the asset base (insh) in the coming years. So that's the background. I am not familiar with any firms or advisors, so I think I will talk to Schwab or someone similar. Anyone who gave advice, I am greatful. I am a trader and I have been in the markets since 2013. Actively since 2017, and I am 42. So trying to plan my fams future. That's it. Don't want to take market risk, as I have plenty of capital under risk daily anyways.",

      "selftext": "There's something truly different about gold/metals ATH right now. As many have pointed out, these are safe haven assets. When there is turmoil in the world, when the value of government currencies are uncertain, equities are uncertain, this is where the money flows. Can't make more of it, no government can affect it, can hold, can travel. EDIT Previous highs, like the 70's, functioned in this way. Gold at all time highs. Equities in the cellar, bonds in the cellar. The dollar was weak and losing credibility — that's what drove gold up. Critically, central banks weren't buying gold back then — many were selling or holding, believing the price had gotten too high. The rally was driven purely by private investors panicking about inflation. Eventually, Volcker jacked rates to 20%, which crushed inflation, strengthened the dollar, and brought strong demand for US treasury bills back. Gold then entered a 20-year bear market, with central banks continuing to sell throughout the 80s and 90s (most famously, the UK dumped half its reserves at the bottom in 1999). In the 70's we were in stagflation (high inflation low growth) in the US though, so interest rates were rising to try to limit inflation, but inflation remained high and growth was low... so demand for t bills was still weak, high inflation. So the fed made a crazy move - pegged interest to 20%. This killed inflation, and brought strong interest back to the dollar, and gold went into a 20 year decline. They can't do that anymore. The US has gotten into a situation where the treasury needs to service debt more than a third of our annual GDP. How do we service that debt? We issue more bonds. If those bonds paid 20%, we'd go bankrupt. So back to the beginning, what's special about right now. We have never had this situation. Equities are near all time highs. CAPE, which measures P/E ratio of the market, is over 40 for the second time in history, implying very high valuations. The buffet factor, which compares GDP to the value of stocks is at 224%, the highest ever. And we know metals are also at ATH's. What is happening? Everyone knows the fed sets interest rates, but in the 90's, Japan taught all the feds around the world a new trick. Treasury issues bonds. Fed buys them. They just create the money and give it to the treasury. They collect payments. Then they send the interest collected back to the treasury. US does this the most, but everyone has allowed it because there's no better currency. When COVID hit, the fed kicked this into high gear to prevent recession. In one month, they bought $1.3T of bonds (April 2020). They agree to buy $120B per month thereafter. In the last five years, the money in the world has increased from $15T >>> $22T. This is unprecedented, and rightfully so, countries' central banks were feeling like the dollar may be a little less safe if they're just going apeshit printing money. (Also that COVID money went straight to people via stimulus checks and PPP \"loans\" that were forgiven --->> all that extra money drove up equities, properties, groceries... it's the root of the hyper inflation.) Ok we're almost there. 2022. Russia invades Ukraine. US freezes $300B of Russia's dollars. OH shit the dollar isn't what it used to be they are printing it like mad and if they don't like us they can just cancel it. Central banks changed their rainy day fund strategy. Instead of buying \\~400 tons of gold per year (about 12% of demand) they started buying 1200 tons - 25% of demand in 2024. Now they are buying 900. They are only buying less because the price is up, they don't care about the price they are buying anyway. Jewelry is still buying the same 1200 tons regardless of price. Retail is buying 1000 tons because of the same reason central banks are, and industry can't buy less. They are buying less treasury bonds. So the dollar has fallen 15% in the last year. Tariffs just making it worse for the dollar. So why would this stop? US deficit just got way bigger with the big beautiful bill. Which means more t bills, and the interest rate is starting to divorce from fed rate changes because there is too much supply. They can't raise interest rates like the 70's. If stagflation hits (low growth, high unemployment AND high inflation) we are fucked. Remember our clever friend Japan? Well they just kept buying their t bills. Then they started buying nikkei stocks too. They hold 226% of their gdp in debt, interest is zero, and the yen is cratering. (One of the only places to take your dollar on vacation right now, FYI.) Stocks WILL drop - who knows when exactly, but the highest CAPE ever was 44 in the dotcom era, we're at 40+. Oh and another record - $1.3T of those stocks are leveraged. When the drop happens where is the safe haven now? Dollar is no longer safe haven. This is why I think gold, silver, platinum could double again. Side note: as soon as the world accepts bitcoin does in fact check every box gold does in these situations I think it goes apeshit too. Signs are already there - in October is started behaving a little differently - it's not a high risk asset that should track equities, it's a safety asset. Quantum computing the core risk there IMO.",

      "selftext_processed": "Theres something truly different about goldmetals ATH right now . As many have pointed out these are safe haven assets . When there is turmoil in the world when the value of government currencies are uncertain equities are uncertain this is where the money flows . Cant make more of it no_government can affect it can hold can travel . EDIT Previous highs like the 70s functioned in this way . Gold at all time highs . Equities in the cellar bonds in the cellar . The dollar was weak and losing credibility — thats what drove gold up . Critically central banks werent buying gold back then — many were selling or holding believing the price had gotten too high . The rally was driven purely by private investors panicking about inflation . Eventually Volcker jacked rates to 20 % which crushed inflation strengthened the dollar and brought strong demand for US treasury bills back . Gold then entered a 20year bear market with central banks continuing to sell throughout the 80s and 90s most famously the UK dumped half its reserves at the bottom in 1999 . In the 70s we were in stagflation high inflation low growth in the US though so interest rates were rising to try to limit inflation but inflation remained high and growth was low ... so demand for t bills was still weak high inflation . So the fed made a crazy move pegged interest to 20 % . This killed inflation and brought strong interest back to the dollar and gold went into a 20 year decline . They cant do that anymore . The US has gotten into a situation where the treasury needs to service debt more than a third of our annual GDP . How do we service that debt We issue more bonds . If those bonds paid 20 % wed go bankrupt . So back to the beginning whats special about right now . We have never_had this situation . Equities are near all time highs . CAPE which measures PE ratio of the market is over 40 for the second time in history implying very high valuations . The buffet factor which compares GDP to the value of stocks is at 224 % the highest ever . And we know metals are also at ATHs . What is happening Everyone knows the fed sets interest rates but in the 90s Japan taught all the feds around the world a new trick . Treasury issues bonds . Fed buys them . They just create the money and give it to the treasury . They collect payments . Then they send the interest collected back to the treasury . US does this the most but everyone has allowed it because theres no_better currency . When COVID hit the fed kicked this into high gear to prevent recession . In one month they bought $ 1.3T of bonds April 2020 . They agree to buy $ 120B per month thereafter . In the last five years the money in the world has increased from $ 15T $ 22T . This is unprecedented and rightfully so countries central banks were feeling like the dollar may be a little less safe if theyre just going apeshit printing money . Also that COVID money went straight to people via stimulus checks and PPP loans that were forgiven all that extra money drove up equities properties groceries ... its the root of the hyper inflation . Ok were almost there . 2022 . Russia invades Ukraine . US freezes $ 300B of Russias dollars . OH shit the dollar isnt what it used to be they are printing it like mad and if they dont like us they can just cancel it . Central banks changed their rainy day fund strategy . Instead of buying 400 tons of gold per year about 12 % of demand they started buying 1200 tons 25 % of demand in 2024 . Now they are buying 900 . They are only buying less because the price is up they dont care about the price they are buying anyway . Jewelry is still buying the same 1200 tons regardless of price . Retail is buying 1000 tons because of the same reason central banks are and industry cant buy less . They are buying less treasury bonds . So the dollar has fallen 15 % in the last year . Tariffs just making it worse for the dollar . So why would this stop US deficit just got way bigger with the big beautiful bill . Which means more t bills and the interest rate is starting to divorce from fed rate changes because there is too much supply . They cant raise interest rates like the 70s . If stagflation hits low growth high unemployment AND high inflation we are fucked . Remember our clever friend Japan Well they just kept buying their t bills . Then they started buying nikkei stocks too . They hold 226 % of their gdp in debt interest is zero and the yen is cratering . One of the only places to take your dollar on vacation right now FYI . Stocks WILL drop who knows when exactly but the highest CAPE ever was 44 in the dotcom era were at 40 . Oh and another record $ 1.3T of those stocks are leveraged . When the drop happens where is the safe haven now Dollar is no_longer safe haven . This is why I think gold silver platinum could double again . Side note as soon as the world accepts bitcoin does in fact check every box gold does in these situations I think it goes apeshit too . Signs are already there in October is started behaving a little differently its not_a high risk asset that should track equities its a safety asset . Quantum computing the core risk there IMO ."

      "selftext": "hi all, my elderly parents \\[63 & 70\\] are sitting on a decent amount of combined cash, roughly around $200k. the money is just decaying in their bank account, and they asked me to \"do something with it\" we moved to the us 10 years ago, and we do not own a home here and have 0 investments in the country(besides my own roth ira, brokerage and 401k) I\\[23\\] work full time in finance and am essentially the main bread winner of the house given they cannot really work at this point(they have their pension coming from Turkey but its very small given USD/TRY conversion). we have a home in Turkey but for some reason they do not want to move back. their brilliant idea is to put all of this CASH (our only cash) as down-payment on a potential home and have me take out a mortgage. but in these market conditions that feels like absolute suicide. not to mention I only make 75k a year so unsure if i’d be a eligible to buy a decent house. Plan is to somehow invest their money and convince them to move back. I was thinking putting the money into money markets and bonds. Apologies for the word vomit and a subsequent rant. would appreciate any advice.",

Plan is to somehow invest their money and convince them to move back . I was thinking putting the money into money markets and bonds . Apologies for the word vomit and a subsequent rant . would appreciate any advice ."

      "selftext": "TLDR: in September Snapchat announced that users with more than 5GB of memories would have to start paying on a monthly basis or their excess photos/videos would be deleted in September 2026. Users were outraged; investors seem to think it will flop. But I manually collected data that suggests otherwise: **EDIT: I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning. Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat+ revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts. This will address the main complaints from your comments.** I was using Snapchat last weekend when I tapped on my memories and discovered that Snapchat gave me a figure for how many of my friends are already subscribed to Snapchat+ ($5/mo standard rate)... So I started asking everyone on my friends list to tell me how many total friends they have vs how many of their friends subscribe to Snapchat+. This got me to 5.5k total friends of friends. Then I hopped on Omegle for a few hours and asked a bunch of strangers for their data. That’s how I got to 13k+ total friends of friends. “Other Revenue” from the Q3 2025 10-Q was $189M and stated as “majority coming from Snapchat+”. It accounted for 9% of total revenue. According to demandsage (dot) com, Snapchat+ had 17M subscribers as of the Q3 Earnings report. **477M Daily Active Users -> 3.56% of DAUs were subscribed. At 900M Monthly Users -> 1.88% of MAUs were subscribed** (MAUs may be a more effective metric. See end). **And Subscription revenue is often valued twice as much as ad revenue.** **Sources of Error:** * “Total users” from the polling includes inactive accounts. This is why I suspect Snap+/MAUs is a better comparison than DAUs (the Snapchat+ rate as a percentage of DAUs could be higher than the sample). * Snapchat Platinum ($15/mo) and the cheaper storage option ($2/mo) are both excluded. * Subscription rates (as a percentage of users) could go up even more over the year as the memory deletion date (Sep 2026) approaches. * Snap gives discounts when buying annually as opposed to monthly. **Of course, the sample size is only a fraction of the total user base.** **And that’s where the regard army comes in.** Help me take this from 13k to 100k+ datapoints. Regards, I call upon thee! **HOW TO FIND HOW MANY FRIENDS HAVE SNAPCHAT+** Step 1: Go to your profile and tap on the “Try Snapchat+” button at the top. NOTE: Only appears for users who don’t have Snapchat+. Step 2: Write down the circled number. If it doesn’t appear, restart the app and try again. **HOW TO FIND YOUR TOTAL FRIEND COUNT:** Step 1: Click this smiley face in the bottom right of the main screen Step 2: Search for “How many” and click the first filter. Write down the number above your head. **Please put your stats in the comments!** If you include your age and rough location, I’ll add your data to my dataset. My hunch is that older folks will have lower total friend count and percent of snapchat+ users. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH** **EDIT: I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning. Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat+ revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts. This should address the main complaints from your comments.**",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR in September Snapchat announced that users with more than 5GB of memories would have to start paying on a monthly basis or their excess photosvideos would be deleted in September 2026 . Users were outraged investors seem to think it will flop . But I manually collected data that suggests otherwise EDIT I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning . Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts . This will address the main complaints from your comments . I was using Snapchat last weekend when I tapped on my memories and discovered that Snapchat gave me a figure for how many of my friends are already subscribed to Snapchat $ 5mo standard rate ... So I started asking everyone on my friends list to tell me how many total friends they have vs how many of their friends subscribe to Snapchat . This got me to 5.5k total friends of friends . Then I hopped on Omegle for a few hours and asked a bunch of strangers for their data . That ’ s how I got to 13k total friends of friends . “ Other Revenue ” from the Q3 2025 10Q was $ 189M and stated as “ majority coming from Snapchat ” . It accounted for 9 % of total revenue . According to demandsage dot com Snapchat had 17M subscribers as of the Q3 Earnings report . 477M Daily Active Users 3.56 % of DAUs were subscribed . At 900M Monthly Users 1.88 % of MAUs were subscribed MAUs may be a more effective metric . See end . And Subscription revenue is often valued twice as much as ad revenue . Sources of Error “ Total users ” from the polling includes inactive accounts . This is why I suspect SnapMAUs is a better comparison than DAUs the Snapchat rate as a percentage of DAUs could be higher than the sample . Snapchat Platinum $ 15mo and the cheaper storage option $ 2mo are both excluded . Subscription rates as a percentage of users could go up even more over the year as the memory deletion date Sep 2026 approaches . Snap gives discounts when buying annually as opposed to monthly . Of course the sample size is only a fraction of the total user base . And that ’ s where the regard army comes in . Help me take this from 13k to 100k datapoints . Regards I call upon thee HOW TO FIND HOW MANY FRIENDS HAVE SNAPCHAT Step 1 Go to your profile and tap on the “ Try Snapchat ” button at the top . NOTE Only appears for users who don ’ t have Snapchat . Step 2 Write down the circled number . If it doesn ’ t appear restart the app and try again . HOW TO FIND YOUR TOTAL FRIEND COUNT Step 1 Click this smiley face in the bottom right of the main screen Step 2 Search for “ How many ” and click the first filter . Write down the number above your head . Please put your stats in the comments If you include your age and rough location I ’ ll add your data to my dataset . My hunch is that older folks will have lower total friend count and percent of snapchat users . DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH EDIT I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning . Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts . This should address the main complaints from your comments ."

Invested that way for a while but it ebbed and flowed. First child comes a long and teaching went to the way side, day trading idea went out the window and there was not enough time in the day. Started maxing 401K investing MF and forget. Kids are older and have more time opted to try more of swing trading approach. About 5 years ago I changed again to a buy hold and buy dips. That has worked out pretty well. However when I choose to rebalance I slip into a swing trading mode which I should not do. 2 thing influence the habit a stock rockets and I take profit or I reach a negative threshold and sell to reinvest. How do you change your habits to be more patient? I do have some stocks that are very volatile and I do wait out the swings with those but I am confident with those. It is the newer stocks that I research that create that behavior.",

Started maxing 401K investing MF and forget . Kids are older and have more time opted to try more of swing trading approach . About 5 years ago I changed again to a buy hold and buy dips . That has worked out pretty well . However when I choose to rebalance I slip into a swing trading mode which I should not_do . 2 thing influence the habit a stock rockets and I take profit or I reach a negative threshold and sell to reinvest . How do you change your habits to be more patient I do have some stocks that are very volatile and I do wait out the swings with those but I am confident with those . It is the newer stocks that I research that create that behavior ."

      "selftext": "I am in love with the stock market and I recently came up with (what I think may be) a fun idea: A website/app for ranked trading and investing. Here's the rundown: \\- You connect your broker account or manually input all positions to track your portfolio \\- There will be daily, weekly, monthly and YTD leaderboards based on your return. \\-From there it's simple, outperform 90% of other investors in the time period? You get a high rank and officially earn bragging rights. Blow 100% of your portfolio buying penny stocks with 1000x leverage? You get a low rank and get shamed by other users. Personally, I think this will be great, it gamifies the stock market and allows you and your friends to get a little more competitive. I do have some other ideas as well, however these do stray a little from the core of the idea: \\- Social feed to share ideas on your stock picks \\- Built in news tab \\- A daily quiz about recent news, where correct answers grant you entries into prize draws. \\- Built-in trading companions to win prizes. I'm really excited about this idea and I would love to make it happen. If there's any feedback you have please let me know in the comments.",

Heres the rundown You connect your broker account or manually input all positions to track your portfolio There will be daily weekly monthly and YTD leaderboards based on your return . From there its simple outperform 90 % of other investors in the time period You get a high rank and officially earn bragging rights . Blow 100 % of your portfolio buying penny stocks with 1000x leverage You get a low rank and get shamed by other users . Personally I think this will be great it gamifies the stock market and allows you and your friends to get a little more competitive . I do have some other ideas as well however these do stray a little from the core of the idea Social feed to share ideas on your stock picks Built in news tab A daily quiz about recent news where correct answers grant you entries into prize draws . Builtin trading companions to win prizes . Im really excited about this idea and I would love to make it happen . If theres any feedback you have please let me know in the comments ."

      "selftext": "If you want to last, **cheat the institutions**. Not by fighting them. By **observing them**. Tether purchased 27 tons of gold in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the acquisition currently valued at approximately $4.4 billion according to Reuters. This purchase follows a 26-ton acquisition in Q3 2025, bringing Tether's total reported gold holdings to over 140 tons. In the same quarter, Tether also acquired 8,888 Bitcoin worth about $850 million. We can talk all day about strategies, indicators, setups. But one thing is certain: institutions don’t just set the direction, they almost always **hold the best cards**. They see it first. They position first. And most importantly, they never get attached to a narrative. While many were still debating, **gold printed a new ATH at 5100**. And that didn’t happen by accident. Tether, on its side, positioned itself **at the right time**: 27 tons of gold bought in Q4 2025. No tweet. No speech. Just action. Now, with the current headlines, I honestly think this is **only the beginning**. Intel stock took its share, dropping -17% in a single day. At that point, it became very clear to me that I had made the right decision by getting out and focusing only on the short term, using Bitget Stock Futures for easy entries, trading long or short Temporarily. The entire market could react even worse with what’s coming: tariffs, politics, macro, liquidity. And that’s where my real questions begin: **Gold at 5100 is it still possible to enter?** **Is this really the right moment to take a position?**",

Tether purchased 27 tons of gold in the fourth quarter of 2025 with the acquisition currently valued at approximately $ 4.4 billion according to Reuters . This purchase follows a 26ton acquisition in Q3 2025 bringing Tethers total reported gold holdings to over 140 tons . In the same quarter Tether also acquired 8888 Bitcoin worth about $ 850 million . We can talk all day about strategies indicators setups . But one thing is certain institutions don ’ t just set the direction they almost always hold the best cards . They see it first . They position first . And most importantly they never_get attached to a narrative . While many were still debating gold printed a new ATH at 5100 . And that didn ’ t happen by accident . Tether on its side positioned itself at the right time 27 tons of gold bought in Q4 2025 . No_tweet . No_speech . Just action . Now with the current headlines I honestly think this is only the beginning . Intel stock took its share dropping 17 % in a single day . At that point it became very clear to me that I had made the right decision by getting out and focusing only on the short term using Bitget Stock Futures for easy entries trading long or short Temporarily . The entire market could react even worse with what ’ s coming tariffs politics macro liquidity . And that ’ s where my real questions begin Gold at 5100 is it still possible to enter Is this really the right moment to take a position"

      "title": "$NOW (ServiceNow): premium valuation, but elite fundamentals",
      "selftext": "($NOW) and I’m curious why it gets relatively little attention compared to more visible AI or semiconductor names. A few fundamentals that stand out to me: • \\~20–21% subscription revenue growth at large scale • Renewal rate consistently around 97–98% • Non-GAAP operating margin above 30% • Strong free cash flow generation (\\~30%+ FCF margin annually) • RPO and cRPO both growing >20% YoY, giving solid revenue visibility What I like is that this isn’t an “AI hype” story. AI is embedded into existing enterprise workflows (IT, HR, finance, customer operations) that companies already rely on. These are mission-critical systems with high switching costs, which explains the low churn and steady expansion within accounts. Valuation is clearly premium, so this isn’t a cheap stock. But the combination of durable growth, margin expansion and predictable cash flow makes it look more like a long-term compounder than a short-term trade. I recently started building a position and plan to add on pullbacks rather than chase momentum. Curious how others here see $NOW: • Worth the premium vs peers like Salesforce? • Any long-term risks I might be underestimating? Not investment advice, just sharing research and looking for different perspectives.",

      "selftext": "I landed an analyst role at a small but ambitious firm. What I’ve seen there has honestly confused me. I’m trying to figure out whether this is something interesting or just a clever idea that doesn’t hold up in the real world. This firm isn’t focused on the usual private equity, venture capital, or hedge fund activities. They’re not betting on growth stories, turnarounds, or “great management teams.” Their entire thesis is built on one uncomfortable idea: Public markets have many companies trading for less than what they already own. Not “undervalued future potential.” Not “great product, bad quarter.” It’s literally cash, securities, or other liquid assets on the balance sheet that exceed the company’s market cap. The types of companies they look at are usually: \\- Cash-burning \\- Strategically dead or stuck in R&D limbo \\- Unloved by the market But still public, regulated, and liquid. Instead of trying to fix these businesses, the idea is much colder: Buy control or influence, shut down what doesn’t work, liquidate or distribute assets, and turn that “trapped” public-market capital into cash. So far, that part at least makes sense to me. Where I start to feel conflicted is what comes next. They don’t just liquidate, return cash, and move on. The idea is to pool the realized capital into a permanent public vehicle that: \\- Recycles that capital repeatedly \\- Tries to use equity more than debt \\- Focuses on growing NAV per share, not revenue or EPS optics \\- Allocates part of the treasury into Bitcoin (which I know is controversial) The internal framing is basically: “We’re arbitraging public-market mispricing, not running operating companies.” No hero CEOs. No turnaround fantasies. No “this biotech pipeline will work eventually.” Just: buy assets cheaper than they’re worth, realize value, redeploy, repeat. Apparently, there’s historical precedent for this working in individual cases discounts to NAV closing, liquidations happening, and capital being returned. What’s less clear to me is whether this works systematically and at scale, especially when you try to keep recycling capital within one structure. On one hand, the logic feels clean. It avoids a lot of operational execution risk and doesn’t rely on market optimism just arithmetic. On the other hand, public markets are messy: Boards resist. Shareholder votes take time. Regulators interfere. Discounts don’t always close. Cash burn and dilution can quietly eat the upside. Once you start recycling instead of returning capital, timing and incentives suddenly matter a lot more. So I’m not posting this to promote anything. I’m genuinely trying to build judgment early and would appreciate reality checks. For people who’ve seen similar strategies up close: Does public-market NAV arbitrage actually scale as a long-term strategy? Is capital recycling inside a permanent structure where this usually breaks? Or is this one of those ideas that looks elegant on paper but gets crushed by time, politics, and dead capital? I’d really appreciate blunt feedback. If this is naive, I’d prefer to learn that now.",

I ’ m trying to figure out whether this is something interesting or just a clever idea that doesn ’ t hold up in the real world . This firm isn ’ t focused on the usual private equity venture capital or hedge fund activities . They ’ re not_betting on growth stories turnarounds or “ great management teams. ” Their entire thesis is built on one uncomfortable idea Public markets have many companies trading for less than what they already own . Not_ “ undervalued future potential. ” Not_ “ great product bad quarter. ” It ’ s literally cash securities or other liquid assets on the balance sheet that exceed the company ’ s market cap . The types of companies they look at are usually Cashburning Strategically dead or stuck in RD limbo Unloved by the market But still public regulated and liquid . Instead of trying to fix these businesses the idea is much colder Buy control or influence shut down what doesn ’ t work liquidate or distribute assets and turn that “ trapped ” publicmarket capital into cash . So far that part at least makes sense to me . Where I start to feel conflicted is what comes next . They don ’ t just liquidate return cash and move on . The idea is to pool the realized capital into a permanent public vehicle that Recycles that capital repeatedly Tries to use equity more than debt Focuses on growing NAV per share not_revenue or EPS optics Allocates part of the treasury into Bitcoin which I know is controversial The internal framing is basically “ We ’ re arbitraging publicmarket mispricing not_running operating companies. ” No_hero CEOs . No_turnaround fantasies . No_ “ this biotech pipeline will work eventually. ” Just buy assets cheaper than they ’ re worth realize value redeploy repeat . Apparently there ’ s historical precedent for this working in individual cases discounts to NAV closing liquidations happening and capital being returned . What ’ s less clear to me is whether this works systematically and at scale especially when you try to keep recycling capital within one structure . On one hand the logic feels clean . It avoids a lot of operational execution risk and doesn ’ t rely on market optimism just arithmetic . On the other hand public markets are messy Boards resist . Shareholder votes take time . Regulators interfere . Discounts don ’ t always close . Cash burn and dilution can quietly eat the upside . Once you start recycling instead of returning capital timing and incentives suddenly matter a lot more . So I ’ m not_posting this to promote anything . I ’ m genuinely trying to build judgment early and would appreciate reality checks . For people who ’ ve seen similar strategies up close Does publicmarket NAV arbitrage actually scale as a longterm strategy Is capital recycling inside a permanent structure where this usually breaks Or is this one of those ideas that looks elegant on paper but gets crushed by time politics and dead capital I ’ d really appreciate blunt feedback . If this is naive I ’ d prefer to learn that now ."

They don't make their own memory modules, so they are very much under the boot of big data centers buying up all the wafers and memory modules at the moment. But once that supply unblocks their COGS will drop dramatically, at which point I'm betting on a considerable stock rebound. What other stocks are dramatically down right now because they can't get their much-needed supplies due to data center demand saturation?",

Reasonable valuation with room for synergies: procurement scale benefits, overhead reduction, expanding Purells retail presence. What do you guys think of the deal?

The share price is a discount from Friday’s closing price of $92.98. >“CoreWeave’s deep AI factory expertise, platform software, and unmatched execution velocity are recognized across the industry,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Together, we’re racing to meet extraordinary demand for NVIDIA AI factories—the foundation of the AI industrial revolution.” >Nvidia’s investment will help CoreWeave accelerate its buildout of “5 gigawatts of AI factories by 2030,” the companies said. >A gigawatt is a measure of power that’s becoming an increasingly common metric for describing AI data center capacity. Five gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 4 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration. >CoreWeave primarily generates revenue by building and renting out data centers that are full of Nvidia’s graphics processing units, which are key for training models and running large AI workloads. The company, which some investors have classified as a “neocloud,” has become a crucial player in an increasingly interconnected web of AI infrastructure partners. >Nvidia is already a major CoreWeave backer. >In September, CoreWeave disclosed an order worth at least $6.3 billion from Nvidia in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Nvidia has an obligation to buy the “residual unsold capacity through April 2032, according to the agreement. >CoreWeave went public on the Nasdaq in March, and the company raised billions of dollars in debt and equity, including from Nvidia. >As AI startups race to build out their computing infrastructure, CoreWeave has been on a deal-making blitz. The company announced in September that it agreed to provide Meta with $14.2 billion of AI cloud infrastructure, just days after expanding its contract with OpenAI to $22.4 billion.",

The share price is a discount from Friday ’ s closing price of $ 92.98 . “ CoreWeave ’ s deep AI factory expertise platform software and unmatched execution velocity are recognized across the industry ” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement . “ Together we ’ re racing to meet extraordinary demand for NVIDIA AI factories—the foundation of the AI industrial revolution. ” Nvidia ’ s investment will help CoreWeave accelerate its buildout of “ 5 gigawatts of AI factories by 2030 ” the companies said . A gigawatt is a measure of power that ’ s becoming an increasingly common metric for describing AI data center capacity . Five gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 4 million U.S. households according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration . CoreWeave primarily generates revenue by building and renting out data centers that are full of Nvidia ’ s graphics processing units which are key for training models and running large AI workloads . The company which some investors have classified as a “ neocloud ” has become a crucial player in an increasingly interconnected web of AI infrastructure partners . Nvidia is already a major CoreWeave backer . In September CoreWeave disclosed an order worth at least $ 6.3 billion from Nvidia in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . Nvidia has an obligation to buy the “ residual unsold capacity through April 2032 according to the agreement . CoreWeave went public on the Nasdaq in March and the company raised billions of dollars in debt and equity including from Nvidia .

      "selftext": "I had wanted to post this play on Friday evening but preparations for the looming snowstorms delayed things a bit. This past week, we witnessed a precipitous decline in the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies like the euro, Swiss franc, and British pound. Movement that might normally be attributed to recent geopolitical concerns was driven, in part, by another factor. That is, on Friday, the Bank of Japan reached out to the U.S. Treasury Department to ask the U.S. Federal Reserve for a rate check. Murmurs about this rate check trickled out from various currency dealers just before lunchtime on the East Coast in the U.S. It was a widely known secret about an hour afterwards, which led to further downward pressure on the yen that also carried over to the U.S. dollar. I believe that most of the dealers were authorized to publicly comment on the request after the closing bell in New York. For those of you who do not dabble in currencies, rate checks are one way for central banks to strengthen their own currencies. Doing so avoids the hassle of directly raising rates and the negative effects those rate changes can have on domestic growth. Despite the Japanese Ministry of Finance's unprecedented rate increases this year, the yen has been somewhat sluggish to gain favor against other currencies. Japan has fiscal and political concerns that are depressing the yen. Both the Korean won and Taiwanese dollar are similarly weak. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent commented on this currency weakness about a few days ago and presumably again at sidebars at the World Economic Forum meeting. He has probably already started coordinating a strengthening of those currencies against the dollar. Due to these factors, we will see one of two outcomes that play out very soon. If the Japanese Ministry of Finance does not respond promptly, then there will likely be a short squeeze of the yen-dollar currency pair and a further debasement of the yen. If the Japanese Ministry of Finance acts, then it will do so by either raising rates further or offloading U.S. dollars for yen. Swapping currencies was the preferred approach by the two previous Japanese administrations and may be adopted by the current one. Either of these outcomes will undoubtedly lead to further declines of the dollar relative to the yen and other currencies. Rate increases would likely have the longest-lasting impact on depressing the dollar. Yen-denominated bonds would start to look even more attractive compared to dollar-based treasuries while coming with significantly fewer political concerns. This could lead to an outflow of dollars in favor of the yen. Alternatively, a sharp yen rally absent a rate hike would likely cause another violent drop of the U.S. dollar. This would be coupled with the potential for a slow dollar recovery rally against the yen a few weeks later, though. This knowledge leads to a few YOLO plays especially if no actions are taken by Japan during overnight hours on Sunday and pre-market hours on Monday. My preferred play is to continue to trade a market with which I am familiar, which is commodities. In particular, I am banking on the fact that a continuously declining dollar, caused in the short term by the forced strengthening of certain Asian currencies, will act as a short-term and medium-term backstop against any large pullbacks in precious metals like gold. If anything, it may allow for continued upwards movement in spot gold prices going into earnings season for gold and silver miners. That, in turn, could raise forward guidance for miners and lead to a few surprise gains for the biggest entities. My plan is to continue to hold approximately $6.61M in UGL (90000 shares) and $2.08M in GDXU (4500 shares) for a bit longer than I had planned. I have entered into and exited from these positions a few times over an extended period and typically held them for about two to three months each stretch. I was able to ride the rallies from near their beginnings and skip the dips at the expense of a huge tax bill. I most recently re-entered into these positions at the beginning of the new year and accelerated purchasing two weeks ago. I will be paring those positions and rotating most of the principal back into their non-leveraged versions and various, non-leveraged equities once I hit certain targets. Also, since I will likely get asked about this, I prefer to hold leveraged ETF/ETN shares versus LEAPS contracts for large positions like these that are highly speculative. Holding shares allows me to buy and sell during pre-market hours and thus start trimming to lock in gains when there is a wave of negative sentiment forming. This has been useful several times. In December, I was able to dodge a 10% overall decline in UGL and a 25% decline on GDXU, which was spurred by CME's margin capital increase, by selling right at pre-market open. My draw down was only in the 2-4% range for both positions. Similarly, in October, I was able to walk away with only a 3-6% decline in both positions versus an approximately 10-15% total decrease had I been forced to wait until market open.",

      "selftext_processed": "I had wanted to post this play on Friday evening but preparations for the looming snowstorms delayed things a bit . This past week we witnessed a precipitous decline in the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies like the euro Swiss franc and British pound . Movement that might normally be attributed to recent geopolitical concerns was driven in part by another factor . That is on Friday the Bank of Japan reached out to the U.S. Treasury Department to ask the U.S. Federal Reserve for a rate check . Murmurs about this rate check trickled out from various currency dealers just before lunchtime on the East Coast in the U.S . It was a widely known secret about an hour afterwards which led to further downward pressure on the yen that also carried over to the U.S. dollar . I believe that most of the dealers were authorized to publicly comment on the request after the closing bell in New York . For those of you who do not_dabble in currencies rate checks are one way for central banks to strengthen their own currencies . Doing so avoids the hassle of directly raising rates and the negative effects those rate changes can have on domestic growth . Despite the Japanese Ministry of Finances unprecedented rate increases this year the yen has been somewhat sluggish to gain favor against other currencies . Japan has fiscal and political concerns that are depressing the yen . Both the Korean won and Taiwanese dollar are similarly weak . U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent commented on this currency weakness about a few days ago and presumably again at sidebars at the World Economic Forum meeting . He has probably already started coordinating a strengthening of those currencies against the dollar . Due to these factors we will see one of two outcomes that play out very soon . If the Japanese Ministry of Finance does not_respond promptly then there will likely be a short squeeze of the yendollar currency pair and a further debasement of the yen . If the Japanese Ministry of Finance acts then it will do so by either raising rates further or offloading U.S. dollars for yen . Swapping currencies was the preferred approach by the two previous Japanese administrations and may be adopted by the current one . Either of these outcomes will undoubtedly lead to further declines of the dollar relative to the yen and other currencies . Rate increases would likely have the longestlasting impact on depressing the dollar . Yendenominated bonds would start to look even more attractive compared to dollarbased treasuries while coming with significantly fewer political concerns . This could lead to an outflow of dollars in favor of the yen . Alternatively a sharp yen rally absent a rate hike would likely cause another violent drop of the U.S. dollar . This would be coupled with the potential for a slow dollar recovery rally against the yen a few weeks later though . This knowledge leads to a few YOLO plays especially if no_actions are taken by Japan during overnight hours on Sunday and premarket hours on Monday . My preferred play is to continue to trade a market with which I am familiar which is commodities . In particular I am banking on the fact that a continuously declining dollar caused in the short term by the forced strengthening of certain Asian currencies will act as a shortterm and mediumterm backstop against any large pullbacks in precious metals like gold . If anything it may allow for continued upwards movement in spot gold prices going into earnings season for gold and silver miners . That in turn could raise forward guidance for miners and lead to a few surprise gains for the biggest entities . My plan is to continue to hold approximately $ 6.61M in UGL 90000 shares and $ 2.08M in GDXU 4500 shares for a bit longer than I had planned . I have entered into and exited from these positions a few times over an extended period and typically held them for about two to three months each stretch . I was able to ride the rallies from near their beginnings and skip the dips at the expense of a huge tax bill . I most recently reentered into these positions at the beginning of the new year and accelerated purchasing two weeks ago . I will be paring those positions and rotating most of the principal back into their nonleveraged versions and various nonleveraged equities once I hit certain targets . Also since I will likely get asked about this I prefer to hold leveraged ETFETN shares versus LEAPS contracts for large positions like these that are highly speculative . Holding shares allows me to buy and sell during premarket hours and thus start trimming to lock in gains when there is a wave of negative sentiment forming . This has been useful several times . In December I was able to dodge a 10 % overall decline in UGL and a 25 % decline on GDXU which was spurred by CMEs margin capital increase by selling right at premarket open . My draw down was only in the 24 % range for both positions . Similarly in October I was able to walk away with only a 36 % decline in both positions versus an approximately 1015 % total decrease had I been forced to wait until market open ."

      "title": "Impinj DD - RAIN RFID for consumers?",
      "selftext": "My position details: I own 1,982 shares of Impinj (PI) stock. PI market cap: $4.8B Impinj manufactures UHF (RAIN) RFID tag integrated circuits (ICs). They sell more than about 15 billion per year. Impinj might sell a tag IC for $0.005-$0.02. Impinj sells the tag ICs to inlay manufacturers like Avery Denison and others. Inlay manufacturers sell inlays (tag IC + antenna + substrate) to end customers to attach to their products. Tags can be little stickers, adhered to paper clothing tags, sewed nearly invisibly into clothing, hidden inside anything non-metallic or non-liquid, etc. Impinj also manufactures expensive stand-alone RFID readers, but also sells the reader IC used by several other companies who then sell their cheaper readers to end customers. I don't have much to say about their readers. Impinj competes with NXP in tag ICs/chips. Impinj won lawsuit against NXP in 2024 and receives license fee yearly. Part of settlement beyond the yearly cash is a 10-year agreement to not sue over patents, which is a huge relief for Impinj through 2034. David defeated Goliath once and Impinj has 8 more years before any possible rematches. For the next 8 years, Impinj has freedom to grow aggressively without fear of immediate retaliatory litigation from NXP. RAIN RFID is currently used in places like: Walmart, Inditex (clothing), UPS (package tracking, package-on-right-truck verification), Delta and United (baggage tracking), medicine tracking, car tires and other parts, etc. Supply chains and clothing, primarily. Recent investor calls show they're starting to push food with Kroger. Food opportunity for Impinj and tagging is obviously very large compared to their current markets, which may explain their current valuation, which is arguably high. They're starting in the bakery sections now. Engineering deets you can skip if you're not technical: Tag ICs have been improving in performance, usually about 1-2dB (RF link budget spec for tag sensitivity) per generation / node shrink. This has been essential to the technology's capability and expanded usage. I asked Gemini about next node and it's guessing 20-something nm will be the final node and its reasons are sound, which means tag chip analog performance improvement is nearing its end and the analog circuitry will not get smaller. Impinj knows this. Digital performance/capability/featureset may yet still improve with even smaller nodes. Impinj has been focusing on broadening featureset like cryptography and gen2x and is clearly leading and driving its technology. Also, smaller node = more tag ICs per wafer = cheaper tag ICs, so Impinj still certainly has one more significant margin increase ahead. 20-something nm nodes are well matured at this point and should not have a premium. Impinj requires cheap wafers. Impinj likes to talk about the European DPP initiative in their investor calls (do your own reading on this). I know Trump is fucking over US-EU relations and is causing EU re-evaluation of large initiatives and regulations, so I have my doubts about DPP ever using RAIN RFID at all, even as a option/backup. HOWEVER, Impinj clearly sees it as a backdoor into the real endgame: retail consumers. Right now, RAIN RFID tags are always killed at checkout. The EU DPP would expand RAIN RFID adoption obviously, but more importantly would necessarily keep tags alive after item purchase. Consumer use is the reason for Impinj's new \"Protected Mode\". Tags with Protected mode look dead and only wake up if given the right PIN. Retailer controls PIN and can transfer PIN to consumer via smartphone, or Kroger could set PIN(s) for all its products and allow consumers to query their groceries' tags at home for pantry inventory, etc. You get the idea. There's also insights into Impinj's thoughts from press releases on Gen2x, which extends the protocol the tag ICs use: \"It \\[Gen2x\\] addresses consumer privacy at point-of-sale.. \\[...\\] We are today focused on enterprise use cases, but tomorrow’s emphasis will be on consumer use cases, including consumer safety and item sustainability.\" \"Inhibits tag and item counterfeiting, fraudulent returns, or both.\" \"Impinj Protected Mode tag data protection Makes a RAIN tag invisible to RAIN readers. When necessary, the tag can be returned to normal operation using a secure PIN.\" \"Impinj Authenticity cryptographic authentication Verifies a product’s authenticity using a challenge-response protocol, preventing counterfeits and securing the supply chain.\" I suspect that authentication requires a centralized database to verify that the tag chip itself is authentic. Impinj must control that. I doubt that Impinj will control the item info itself ('this is a Nike Air shoe, number 123456' for example) but will control authentication and will certainly charge a fee per scan for authentication ('Impinj indeed made this tag IC, it matches code xyzpdq in our authentication database'). So Impinj won't know what the product is (only the brands will, like Walmart or Nike), but Impinj uniquely will be involved in \\*every tag scan for authentication\\*. Impinj will not make ad revenue on item data itself - only end-users like Nike or Kroger would. However, Impinj will certainly charge for authentication events like store purchases/returns. Imagine getting an additional few cents return per tag IC via the authentication service. Impinj is clearly trying to get into consumer phones. Qualcomm Q-6690 - UHF (RAIN) RFID integrated into mobile processor for the first time. Commercial/industrial device focus only. It's a relatively easy jump to consumer smartphones from here now that a UHF/RAIN RFID radio has been integrated into an IC. That will unlock tons more potential. Smartphone manufactueres may be excited about finally introducing a significant new feature. I see this playing out like so: 1. Consumer enables RFID reading on their household grocery items via Kroger (or their clothing items via Kohls or whoever) 2. For the first time, companies get information on where items go once they leave the stores and how long they stay there. 3. Companies know what food is in someone's house and how long it's been there. 4. Companies know what clothing is in someone's house and how long it's been there. 5. Fundamentally, Companies know identifying information of any UHF (RAIN) RFID tagged item in anyone's house (if the tag IC is alive and enabled), as long as consumers have a phone that can read them AND as long as consumers allow the tags to be read again with the PIN from the store they bought their stuff from. 6. Advertiser potential galore for whoever has this information. Impinj won't make money off this directly, but this'll push more tags to be in more things. 7. Companies will want to tag fucking everything, so Impinj sells 100s of billions of tags per year instead of 15 billion. I'd say >20x growth potential, reasonably, not including the value of authentication services which is fuzzy to me. Wiliot has been brought up as an existential threat to RAIN RFID because it uses Bluetooth (which everyone already has) but I don't see it. Inlays are 2-5x as expensive, read rate is 100x to >1000x slower, tag beacons its info out randomly instead of upon query by a reader/interrogator, tag beaconing interval depends on ambient energy levels which vary everywhere. I'd forget about it. I think Impinj needs to hit +20% yearly growth by gaining enterprise customers to meet investor expectations and today's valuation. Hitting those high targets will reward Impinj with consistent $200+/share. Consumer market is the moonshot / gamble for long term holders. Authentication, to me, is a positive thing of unknown magnitude/effect, though it'd definitely improve margins. Risks: \\-Trump's continued antagonizing of Europe (and the world) may harm/kill RAIN RFID consumer adoption via DPP as EU countries reprioritize and/or may create preference for NXP within the EU. Reducing global cooperation is bad for global standards for RAIN RFID. \\-Stock is unusually volatile despite being recently added to S&P smallcap 600. Seems to have a strong yearly cycle based on retail/holiday cycle. Many sudden ups/downs based on enterprise performance and news and whether investors believe in the company's growth as a result. Be patient and only buy in low if you buy in. \\-The timeline to break into the consumer space, if it ever does, may still be long. Obstacles: \\-Tagging metal surfaces (like canned goods or foil-lined bags) can be done and the physics has been solved, but crucially it remains expensive at >$0.60 per tag. A normal RAIN RFID tag (tag IC + inlay) might be $0.035-$0.05. A cost breakthrough for metal surfaces would be big news. Until then, this fundamentally limits RAIN RFID in grocery and remains a barrier for the technology. \\-Breaking into consumer (normal person) smartphones for the high growth trajectory. Impinj is making all the right moves so far, but it's a barrier that hasn't been broken yet. Bulls: \\-If you hear about major new enterprise customers, that's bullish. Imipnj can dream about getting Amazon. \\-If you hear about the launch of an Impinj authentication service, that's bullish. \\-If you hear that RAIN RFID tags for metal surfaces have a cost breakthrough, that's very bullish. \\-If the EU \\*mandates\\* RAIN RFID for DPP, that's very bullish (whereas if RAIN RFID is just an option, that's somewhat bullish). \\-If any major smartphone manufacturer announces UHF (RAIN) RFID capability built into consumer phones, that's extremely bullish. Bears: \\-If Impinj fails to secure new large enterprise accounts, that's bearish. \\-If Impinj's only growth over the next two years is through increasing its market share (like vs NXP) rather than new market growth, that's very bearish. Recommendation: Diversify your portfolio with Impinj if it dips below \\~$110. Buy a large amount if it ever dips below $70 (like last April) because I'd peg Impinj at roughly $50-$60 without its growth premium at all. Sit on it for 3 years and then re-evaluate.",

      "selftext_processed": "My position details I own 1982 shares of Impinj PI stock . PI market cap $ 4.8B Impinj manufactures UHF RAIN RFID tag integrated circuits ICs . They sell more than about 15 billion per year . Impinj might sell a tag IC for $ 0.005 $ 0.02 . Impinj sells the tag ICs to inlay manufacturers like Avery Denison and others . Inlay manufacturers sell inlays tag IC antenna substrate to end customers to attach to their products . Tags can be little stickers adhered to paper clothing tags sewed nearly invisibly into clothing hidden inside anything nonmetallic or nonliquid etc . Impinj also manufactures expensive standalone RFID readers but also sells the reader IC used by several other companies who then sell their cheaper readers to end customers . I dont have much to say about their readers . Impinj competes with NXP in tag ICschips . Impinj won lawsuit against NXP in 2024 and receives license fee yearly . Part of settlement beyond the yearly cash is a 10year agreement to not_sue over patents which is a huge relief for Impinj through 2034 . David defeated Goliath once and Impinj has 8 more years before any possible rematches . For the next 8 years Impinj has freedom to grow aggressively without fear of immediate retaliatory litigation from NXP . RAIN RFID is currently used in places like Walmart Inditex clothing UPS package tracking packageonrighttruck verification Delta and United baggage tracking medicine tracking car tires and other parts etc . Supply chains and clothing primarily . Recent investor calls show theyre starting to push food with Kroger . Food opportunity for Impinj and tagging is obviously very large compared to their current markets which may explain their current valuation which is arguably high . Theyre starting in the bakery sections now . Engineering deets you can skip if youre not_technical Tag ICs have been improving in performance usually about 12dB RF link budget spec for tag sensitivity per generation node shrink . This has been essential to the technologys capability and expanded usage . I asked Gemini about next node and its guessing 20something nm will be the final node and its reasons are sound which means tag chip analog performance improvement is nearing its end and the analog circuitry will not_get smaller . Impinj knows this . Digital performancecapabilityfeatureset may yet still improve with even smaller nodes . Impinj has been focusing on broadening featureset like cryptography and gen2x and is clearly leading and driving its technology . Also smaller node more tag ICs per wafer cheaper tag ICs so Impinj still certainly has one more significant margin increase ahead . 20something nm nodes are well matured at this point and should not_have a premium . Impinj requires cheap wafers . Impinj likes to talk about the European DPP initiative in their investor calls do your own reading on this . I know Trump is fucking over USEU relations and is causing EU reevaluation of large initiatives and regulations so I have my doubts about DPP ever using RAIN RFID at all even as a optionbackup . HOWEVER Impinj clearly sees it as a backdoor into the real endgame retail consumers . Right now RAIN RFID tags are always killed at checkout . The EU DPP would expand RAIN RFID adoption obviously but more importantly would necessarily keep tags alive after item purchase . Consumer use is the reason for Impinjs new Protected Mode . Tags with Protected mode look dead and only wake up if given the right PIN . Retailer controls PIN and can transfer PIN to consumer via smartphone or Kroger could set PINs for all its products and allow consumers to query their groceries tags at home for pantry inventory etc . You get the idea . Theres also insights into Impinjs thoughts from press releases on Gen2x which extends the protocol the tag ICs use It Gen2x addresses consumer privacy at pointofsale .. ... We are today focused on enterprise use cases but tomorrow ’ s emphasis will be on consumer use cases including consumer safety and item sustainability . Inhibits tag and item counterfeiting fraudulent returns or both . Impinj Protected Mode tag data protection Makes a RAIN tag invisible to RAIN readers . When necessary the tag can be returned to normal operation using a secure PIN . Impinj Authenticity cryptographic authentication Verifies a product ’ s authenticity using a challengeresponse protocol preventing counterfeits and securing the supply chain . I suspect that authentication requires a centralized database to verify that the tag chip itself is authentic . Impinj must control that . I doubt that Impinj will control the item info itself this is a Nike Air shoe number 123456 for example but will control authentication and will certainly charge a fee per scan for authentication Impinj indeed made this tag IC it matches code xyzpdq in our authentication database . So Impinj wont know what the product is only the brands will like Walmart or Nike but Impinj uniquely will be involved in every tag scan for authentication . Impinj will not_make ad revenue on item data itself only endusers like Nike or Kroger would . However Impinj will certainly charge for authentication events like store purchasesreturns . Imagine getting an additional few cents return per tag IC via the authentication service . Impinj is clearly trying to get into consumer phones . Qualcomm Q6690 UHF RAIN RFID integrated into mobile processor for the first time . Commercialindustrial device focus only . Its a relatively easy jump to consumer smartphones from here now that a UHFRAIN RFID radio has been integrated into an IC . That will unlock tons more potential . Smartphone manufactueres may be excited about finally introducing a significant new feature . I see this playing out like so 1 . Consumer enables RFID reading on their household grocery items via Kroger or their clothing items via Kohls or whoever 2 . For the first time companies get information on where items go once they leave the stores and how long they stay there . 3 . Companies know what food is in someones house and how long its been there . 4 . Companies know what clothing is in someones house and how long its been there . 5 . Fundamentally Companies know identifying information of any UHF RAIN RFID tagged item in anyones house if the tag IC is alive and enabled as long as consumers have a phone that can read them AND as long as consumers allow the tags to be read again with the PIN from the store they bought their stuff from . 6 . Advertiser potential galore for whoever has this information . Impinj wont make money off this directly but thisll push more tags to be in more things . 7 . Companies will want to tag fucking everything so Impinj sells 100s of billions of tags per year instead of 15 billion . Id say 20x growth potential reasonably not_including the value of authentication services which is fuzzy to me . Wiliot has been brought up as an existential threat to RAIN RFID because it uses Bluetooth which everyone already has but I dont see it . Inlays are 25x as expensive read rate is 100x to 1000x slower tag beacons its info out randomly instead of upon query by a readerinterrogator tag beaconing interval depends on ambient energy levels which vary everywhere . Id forget about it . I think Impinj needs to hit 20 % yearly growth by gaining enterprise customers to meet investor expectations and todays valuation . Hitting those high targets will reward Impinj with consistent $ 200share . Consumer market is the moonshot gamble for long term holders . Authentication to me is a positive thing of unknown magnitudeeffect though itd definitely improve margins . Risks Trumps continued antagonizing of Europe and the world may harmkill RAIN RFID consumer adoption via DPP as EU countries reprioritize andor may create preference for NXP within the EU . Reducing global cooperation is bad for global standards for RAIN RFID . Stock is unusually volatile despite being recently added to SP smallcap 600 . Seems to have a strong yearly cycle based on retailholiday cycle . Many sudden upsdowns based on enterprise performance and news and whether investors believe in the companys growth as a result . Be patient and only buy in low if you buy in . The timeline to break into the consumer space if it ever does may still be long . Obstacles Tagging metal surfaces like canned goods or foillined bags can be done and the physics has been solved but crucially it remains expensive at $ 0.60 per tag . A normal RAIN RFID tag tag IC inlay might be $ 0.035 $ 0.05 . A cost breakthrough for metal surfaces would be big news . Until then this fundamentally limits RAIN RFID in grocery and remains a barrier for the technology . Breaking into consumer normal person smartphones for the high growth trajectory . Impinj is making all the right moves so far but its a barrier that hasnt been broken yet . Bulls If you hear about major new enterprise customers thats bullish . Imipnj can dream about getting Amazon . If you hear about the launch of an Impinj authentication service thats bullish . If you hear that RAIN RFID tags for metal surfaces have a cost breakthrough thats very bullish . If the EU mandates RAIN RFID for DPP thats very bullish whereas if RAIN RFID is just an option thats somewhat bullish . If any major smartphone manufacturer announces UHF RAIN RFID capability built into consumer phones thats extremely bullish . Bears If Impinj fails to secure new large enterprise accounts thats bearish . If Impinjs only growth over the next two years is through increasing its market share like vs NXP rather than new market growth thats very bearish . Recommendation Diversify your portfolio with Impinj if it dips below $ 110 . Buy a large amount if it ever dips below $ 70 like last April because Id peg Impinj at roughly $ 50 $ 60 without its growth premium at all . Sit on it for 3 years and then reevaluate ."
