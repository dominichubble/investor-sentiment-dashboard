      "selftext": "On a serious note, weeks like this always remind me why I started paying attention to macro trends beyond just stocks or crypto, I remember during a previous period of market stress, I ignored metals completely and stayed overexposed to risk assets, only to watch everything dip together. Since then, I’ve made it a habit to at least track gold and silver during volatile periods like this, not necessarily to rush in, but to understand where capital is flowing and what investors are nervous about. Seeing metals run again while equities struggle feels like one of those moments worth paying attention to. Looking at Gold just hitting an all time high with Silver not being left behind, breaking $100 an ounce for the first time. Geopolitical tensions, like the situation in Greenland, and expectations that the Fed might cut rates later this year seem to be driving safe haven demand. Even crypto and trading platforms are feeling the momentum, because I just realized that Bitget TradFi reported hitting $4B in daily trading volume, which shows how active globally the markets are. Meanwhile, U.S. stocks have been unstable. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 are down this week, and individual stocks like Intel have seen sharp drops. Meanwhile, gold miners are seriously benefiting, with shares in companies like Iamgold (IAG), AngloGold Ashanti (AU), and Kinross (KGC) gaining as Gold rises. It’s an interesting week for investors; traditional safe havens like gold and silver are surging while the rest of the market remains unstable.",

      "selftext": "I’m trying to choose a simple long term setup for gold and silver using ETFs and would appreciate some perspectives. The plan is to dollar cost average a small amount every week and hold for 20 plus years with no trading or market timing. This is meant to be a buy and forget hedge alongside equities. For gold, I’m specifically looking at GLD versus IAU. For silver, I’m looking at SLV versus SLVR. I’m mainly concerned with long term reliability, expense ratios, liquidity, tracking accuracy, and any structural risks that could matter over decades. For someone taking a steady weekly DCA approach over a very long time horizon, which gold ETF and which silver ETF would you choose and why?",

      "selftext": "Gold and Silver up recently. Danger territory, it can grow further or decline. If positions closed now the current profit will be locked, but the **future profit missed**. What to do? (no good solution for Silver) **Gold**: protect with puts x0.85 6months. Puts are cheap, good solution. Won't protect against slow and long decline though. **Silver**: no good solution, options are very, very, very expensive. **1)** Close 50-100% of silver positions and move it into Gold protected with puts. **2)** Explosive hedge. Buy large volume (x4 of stock volume), of cheap far otm puts x0.5 4months. Won't help in small-medium decline. But for large sudden drop could go x10 and reduce losses. **3)** Close silver positions and move to silver miners (say WPM). They say silver miners are not yet fully appreciate silver metal up move, so for silver miners the upside potential could be higher. Silver Miners are more reactive than the silver, both up and down. Yet - strangely, puts on miners are a little bit cheaper than puts on silver. So strange situations - more volatile with higher up potential and with cheaper puts. I think at least 30% of silver positions should be closed and go into silver miners protected with puts. Still puts are very costly. **4)** Close silver positions, use 5-10% of money to buy WPM call x1.5 1-2years. The call is insanely costly and would go almost to zero with medium decline, yet 90% of silver profit will stay safe and there will be some exposure to future up move. I have been thinking about this for days, can't decide what to do with silver, any **better ideas**? Note - in my opinion options are better on GLD/SLV because of high liquidity. Yet for positions it's safer to use PHYS/PSLV or miners stocks.",

      "selftext": "I have an asset allocation target including various percentages of: * VOO (VFIAX, S&P 500 index fund) * VB (VSMAX, Small-Cap index fund) * VTV (VVIAX, Value index fund) (along with other non-US-stock and non-stock securities). My retirement accounts currently reflect that target. However, I also have some VTI (VTSAX, Total Stock Market Index) in a taxable account. I don't want to sell that taxable-account VTI to actually reallocate it to VOO, VB, and VTV. (I don't want to trigger capital gains now.) However, I would like to factor that VTI in to my asset allocation (that is, in my retirement accounts, reduce each of VOO, VB, and VTV holdings a bit, since VTI overlaps with those (and increase the other securities correspondingly)). What percentages of VOO, VB, and VTV is VTI roughly equivalent to? If I'm not missing something, VTI is equivalent to some amounts of VOO, VB, and VTV, plus some of whatever VTI covers but those three do not. (Right?) Does anyone here know, or can anyone tell how to find out or compute, those proportions of VOO, VB, and VTV, and that uncovered portion? (Or just: What fractions of the VTI should I consider as counting toward the VOO allocation, the VB allocation, and the VTV allocation? I know it can't be exactly equivalent (since VTI contains things not in funds in my target allocation); I'm just looking for a first-order approximation.) Thanks.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been digging a bit more into META recently and something stood out when I looked at earnings over the last several quarters. Actual EPS has consistently come in above expectations, and forward estimates haven’t rolled over going into the next report (Jan 28). At META’s scale, that kind of sustained earnings momentum feels harder to dismiss than a one-off beat. I’m not ignoring valuation here META isn’t cheap on traditional multiples but the earnings trajectory looks stronger than the broader narrative I still see around the stock. What I’ve found helpful is tracking earnings vs expectations over time (I use Blossom to visualize this across quarters), because it makes it easier to separate short-term price noise from underlying execution. For those who follow META or large-cap tech more generally: Do you still weigh earnings momentum heavily at this size? Or does valuation dominate once companies reach this scale?[](",

Actual EPS has consistently come in above expectations and forward estimates haven ’ t rolled over going into the next report Jan 28 . At META ’ s scale that kind of sustained earnings momentum feels harder to dismiss than a oneoff beat . I ’ m not_ignoring valuation here META isn ’ t cheap on traditional multiples but the earnings trajectory looks stronger than the broader narrative I still see around the stock . What I ’ ve found helpful is tracking earnings vs expectations over time I use Blossom to visualize this across quarters because it makes it easier to separate shortterm price noise from underlying execution . For those who follow META or largecap tech more generally Do you still weigh earnings momentum heavily at this size Or does valuation dominate once companies reach this scale"

      "selftext": "I keep seeing posts claiming “European pension funds are selling US Treasuries” and that it’s some major “Sell America” wave. But if you look at the official U.S. Treasury TIC data, total foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities are at/near all time highs. Treasury TIC (Major Foreign Holders/ able 5) shows the “Grand Total”, around $9.36T (recent monthly data). That’s the opposite of a mass exit. Even Reuters just reported Europe accounted for a huge share of foreign Treasury buying over recent months (The “Europe is dumping” narrative doesn’t match flows). Yes, some specific funds may divest for their own reasons (for example: Denmark had a pension fund selling a $100M Treasury position). But $100M is basically a rounding error vs a $9+ trillion foreign-held market. So in my opinion a lot of this “Europe is dumping bonds” stuff looks like headline amplification/fear engagement farming rather than reality.

      "selftext": "I have the 4/17 $4 calls and shares Talkspace Inc. (NASDAQ: TALK) is a virtual behavioral health company that connects users with licensed therapists and psychiatrists through its digital platform, offering text, audio, and video sessions. The company has successfully pivoted from a direct-to-consumer model to a payer-centric strategy, which has significantly driven its recent growth. Talkspace reported Q3 2025 revenue of $59.4 million, up 25% year-over-year, with payer revenue growing 42%. The company has achieved profitability, posting positive EPS of $0.03 over the last twelve months and EBITDA of $3.35 million. Management narrowed full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $226–$230 million, implying 20–23% year-over-year growth, and expects at least 20% growth to continue into 2026. Strengthening payer relationships have been key to this momentum, with active payer members increasing 29% year-over-year to over 120,000 in Q3 2025. Talkspace is expanding through additional payer integrations expected by Q1 2026 and renewed its Sourcewell cooperative purchasing contract to serve government agencies, educational institutions, and nonprofits across North America. Analyst sentiment remains highly positive, with Buy ratings from Canaccord Genuity ($6 price target), Needham ($5), and KeyBanc ($5), representing meaningful upside from current levels. Investments in AI, including proprietary risk algorithms and plans for an in-house AI chatbot in 2026, position Talkspace well for continued innovation in the digital mental health space. Risks include high valuation multiples, competitive pressures, and gross margin compression from increased payer mix. Despite this, strong cash reserves, sustained revenue growth, and a strategic focus on payer relationships support a favorable long-term outlook.",

      "selftext": "The ongoing proceedings have confirmed that Google’s \"Play Store\" dominance is being challenged not just on a monetary basis (the 30% fee), but on a technical infrastructure level. The court is focused on the \"friction\" Google creates to prevent third-party app stores and direct installations. 1. The Risk for Google ($GOOGL): Google’s high-margin Services segment relies on the \"toll-gate\" model. If the judge enforces the October Injunction (as indicated in the Jan 22nd hearing), Google loses the ability to mandate the Play Store billing system. \"Scare Screens\" Ban: The court is moving toward banning the \"warning\" messages users see when side-loading apps. This removes Google’s primary psychological and technical barrier to competition. Google is under fire for trying to implement \"security fees\" to replace lost commissions. The judge has signaled he may reject any fees that aren't based on actual marginal costs. 2. The Opportunity for Digital Turbine ($APPS): The SingleTap Patent Moat: During the trial, it was revealed that Epic conducted A/B testing with Digital Turbine. The results showed a massive increase in conversion when using DT’s \"frictionless\" installation technology compared to Google’s standard flow. As the \"Gatekeeper\" walls fall, third-party stores (Xbox Mobile, Epic Store, Meta Direct Ads) need a delivery mechanism. Digital Turbine’s SingleTap is the only patented technology currently integrated with Carriers and OEMs that can bypass the Play Store friction legally. The \"March 2026\" Inflection Point: With the judge rejecting a \"sweetheart deal\" between Google and Epic on Jan 22, the original, more aggressive injunction remains the baseline. This paves the way for a massive scaling of installations/day for DT starting in H2 2026. 3. The Epic Games Factor: Epic isn't just fighting for Fortnite; they are fighting for the right to run a full-scale mobile marketplace. Their reliance on DT’s tech during testing proves that the \"Alternative Distribution\" market is ready for commercial scale. The market is currently pricing in \"uncertainty,\" but the technical filings suggest a structural shift. If Google is forced to open its APIs by March, the \"operating leverage\" for platform companies like Digital Turbine could trigger a significant re-rating as they transition from ad-networks to core utility infrastructure for Android.

The court is focused on the friction Google creates to prevent thirdparty app stores and direct installations . 1 . The Risk for Google $ GOOGL Google ’ s highmargin Services segment relies on the tollgate model . If the judge enforces the October Injunction as indicated in the Jan 22nd hearing Google loses the ability to mandate the Play Store billing system . Scare Screens Ban The court is moving toward banning the warning messages users see when sideloading apps . This removes Google ’ s primary psychological and technical barrier to competition . Google is under fire for trying to implement security fees to replace lost commissions . The judge has signaled he may reject any fees that arent based on actual marginal costs . 2 . The Opportunity for Digital Turbine $ APPS The SingleTap Patent Moat During the trial it was revealed that Epic conducted AB testing with Digital Turbine . The results showed a massive increase in conversion when using DT ’ s frictionless installation technology compared to Google ’ s standard flow . As the Gatekeeper walls fall thirdparty stores Xbox Mobile Epic Store Meta Direct Ads need a delivery mechanism . Digital Turbine ’ s SingleTap is the only patented technology currently integrated with Carriers and OEMs that can bypass the Play Store friction legally . The March 2026 Inflection Point With the judge rejecting a sweetheart deal between Google and Epic on Jan 22 the original more aggressive injunction remains the baseline . This paves the way for a massive scaling of installationsday for DT starting in H2 2026 . 3 . The Epic Games Factor Epic isnt just fighting for Fortnite they are fighting for the right to run a fullscale mobile marketplace . Their reliance on DT ’ s tech during testing proves that the Alternative Distribution market is ready for commercial scale . The market is currently pricing in uncertainty but the technical filings suggest a structural shift . If Google is forced to open its APIs by March the operating leverage for platform companies like Digital Turbine could trigger a significant rerating as they transition from adnetworks to core utility infrastructure for Android .

That implies whatever Tesla is doing is going to be wildly profitable. But what evidence is there that this business model can even do that? So far Tesla's best competitor is Waymo, a subsidiary of Google, who are the number one name in autonomous taxis. The thing is, on Google's [SEC filings]( Waymo's revenue is just grouped into the \"Other Bets\" category and that came to only $344M in revenue (not profits) in Q3 2025. If being placed into the \"Other Bets\" category doesn't inspire confidence, what can? Now for comparison, Tesla's total [Q3 revenue]( was $21B, and that number needs to be meaningfully improved by future taxi revenue. So we are to believe Tesla is going to come onto the scene and in a matter of a few years do something to this industry that Waymo couldn't do in over a decade? All while having worse self driving technology and being further from approval than Waymo was several years ago? Ok.",

The market is basically saying \"prove it\" on the chart. What could shift the risk premium is the financing move: NextNRG terminated its At-the-Market Sales Agreement with ThinkEquity, H.C. Wainwright & Co., and Roth Capital Partners effective Jan 17, 2026, and stated it has no immediate plans to set up another ATM in the near future, per the release. Instead, they mentioned prioritizing value-add strategic investors for long-term growth and operational expansion. If thats true, it potentially changes how traders model dilution risk versus upside if execution continues. Do you treat ATM termination as a meaningful catalyst for NXXT, or just a temporary sentiment bump? NFA.",

The market is basically saying prove it on the chart . What could shift the risk premium is the financing move NextNRG terminated its AttheMarket Sales Agreement with ThinkEquity H.C. Wainwright Co. and Roth Capital Partners effective Jan 17 2026 and stated it has no_immediate plans to set up another ATM in the near future per the release . Instead they mentioned prioritizing valueadd strategic investors for longterm growth and operational expansion . If thats true it potentially changes how traders model dilution risk versus upside if execution continues .

      "selftext": "I’ve been watching gold for a while, and this move doesn’t feel like a quick spike anymore. Futures pushing through $4,900 after making repeated highs in such a short time feels more like a structural shift than a trade. What stood out to me is that banks like Goldman are saying private investors are now competing with central banks for supply, mostly through ETFs, after rate cuts kicked in. Their $5,400 target for next year is aggressive, but the logic is that this money isn’t “hot” it’s allocation-driven. Geopolitics keeps reinforcing it too. Every major headline this year Venezuela, tariffs, broader policy uncertainty gold catches a bid. UBS basically echoed the same view, calling gold a reliable hedge again, with $5k as a base case and upside if tensions stick around. With gold already up double digits YTD after last year’s run, it feels like a lot of people are treating it less like insurance and more like a core macro position. Personally, I’ve been following it more closely since getting easier TradFi access on platforms like Bitget TradFi, where tracking gold alongside other macro markets is pretty straightforward. Curious how others here are thinking about this move late stage, or still room to run?",

      "selftext": "Been doing a bit of digging on AIG lately and I’m genuinely surprised how little attention it gets relative to its fundamentals and upcoming catalysts. **1. Valuation is still cheap vs peers** AIG is still trading at a noticeable discount to peers on most metrics (P/E, P/B, and even forward EV/earnings), despite having completed a multi-year restructuring that materially de-risked the business and improved underwriting discipline. The market seems to be pricing AIG like it’s still stuck in the pre-Corebridge days, even though a big part of that drag has already been carved out. **2. The CEO turnover panic looks overdone** The latest selloff was mostly sentiment-driven around the CEO transition. But if you actually read the details, it’s not a messy exit. The succession plan was already in place, the incoming CEO has a very solid profile for the role, and the outgoing CEO isbecoming Executive Chairman. That actually reduces transition risk because the strategic direction isn’t getting ripped up overnight. The anouncement was a bit of a surprise so knee-jerk dip was expected… but the underlying business didn’t suddenly change because someone moved one seat over. **3. Earnings catalyst on deck** AIG tends to beat forecasts more often than not, and we’re heading into the next report after a period of multiple tailwinds: underwriting continues to improve pricing in commercial lines is still favorable capital returns have been strong no obvious blow-ups on the balance sheet If that pattern repeats (and historically it often has), you get the double effect of “oh, the numbers are actually fine” + “the transition isn’t a disaster.” That’s exactly the kind of setup that re-rates a stock from sentiment lows. Not saying it’s guaranteed, but structurally there is room for a sharp sentiment reversal in the next few weeks if earnings come in strong and guidance holds especially since the bear case for the dip was mostly narrative, not fundamentals. Lemme know your thoughts and prayers.",

I can see Average annual total return and Cumulative Total Returns for the stocks my plan limits me to. How can I compare if the stocks I'm limited to are better/worse versus VTI/VOO/VTSAX, etc?

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned. Useful links: * [Investopedia page]( on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow]( analysis; see [definition here]( and read [their PDF on the topic.]( * [FINVIZ]( for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news * [Earnings Whisper]( for earnings details See our past [daily discussions here.]( Also links for: [Technicals]( Tuesday, [Options Trading]( Thursday, and [Fundamentals]( Friday.",

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned . Useful links Investopedia page on fundamental analysis including Discounted Cash Flow analysis see definition here and read their PDF on the topic .

      "selftext": "Transelated version; > The civil service pension fund ABP holds significantly less US debt than it did in March 2025, just before President Trump imposed import tariffs around the world. This is evident from their most recent investment overview, which ABP always publishes with a three-month delay. > At the end of March, the value of US government bonds in ABP's books was still more than €29 billion. At the end of September, ABP was lending only €19 billion to the US, more than a third less. > Experts believe that such a rapid reduction reflects a lack of confidence in the financial stability of the US. The billions that are no longer invested in US government bonds are instead being lent to the Netherlands and Germany. During the same period, ABP lent an additional €3 billion to the Netherlands and more than €6 billion to Germany. > In an interview with Fox News yesterday, Trump threatened “major retaliation” if European countries sell US stocks or bonds. With around €500 billion in pension funds, ABP is the largest fund in the Netherlands and also an important institutional investor worldwide. > **Multiple factors** > The question is whether ABP is deliberately withdrawing money from America or whether the amount lent has decreased in value. Rising interest rates on government bonds, for example, can depress their value. In addition, the new Dutch pension system may also play a role. Pension funds are now allowed to invest more riskily than before and are therefore likely to be selling off relatively safe bonds. > In this case, the higher interest rates are not playing a major role, according to pension experts. Shortly after Trump's announcement of import tariffs in April 2025, bond interest rates rose sharply, but that increase has been virtually wiped out. So that would only explain to a very limited extent why US bonds are recorded at a much lower value, says Bas Werker, professor of pensions and affiliated with the pension think tank Netspar. > Nor does the phasing out of bonds due to the new pension system seem to be on the agenda at ABP, according to Jacintha van Bijnen of pension advisor AON: “If you exchange US bonds for European bonds, you are not disposing of bonds.” > **Selling** > ABP's deliberate policy, i.e., selling or not repurchasing, therefore seems to play a major role. “Trump's unpredictability, and in a broader sense the increasing geopolitical uncertainty, are leading pension funds to take a more critical look than before at their financial and non-financial resilience,” says Pim Zomerdijk of investment advisor Sprenkels. > ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trump's policies. A spokesperson said that they could not comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “protect the interests of our participants.” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell, which could reduce the value of the investment. > ABP seeks stability in order to invest and protect pension funds effectively. “That is what our investment mix is aimed at,” said the spokesperson. Government bonds are generally considered to be a hedge against sharp fluctuations in the stock markets and currencies. > **US debt** > For decades, the US has been considered the safe haven of the financial world, but rising government spending is increasing the national debt. This is raising doubts about whether America is still able to repay those debts. > High debt is not a problem as long as enough countries, investors, and individuals are willing to hold dollars. Trump's import tariffs are putting pressure on trade with other countries. Since his second term as president, the value of the dollar has fallen by more than 10 percent. > Trump is also putting pressure on the central bank, the Fed, to lower interest rates and is threatening to dismiss Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This fall, the Dutch Central Bank also warned of the risk of financial instability and weaker US government bonds. > **Danish pension funds** > This week, it was announced that two pension funds from Denmark have sold their US government bonds. These are funds in which teachers and academics accrue pension rights. A pension fund from Greenland has also said it wants to withdraw investments from the US in response to Trump's threat to take Greenland. > “This decision is the result of weak US public finances,” said Anders Schelde, head of investments at the Danish teachers' pension fund. According to him, it is a matter of risk management. The money is now being invested in less risky investments. > Like ABP, the Danish teachers' pension fund says that the disposal of US debt securities is not directly linked to the rising tensions between the US and Europe. Nevertheless, the two cannot be viewed entirely separately: “Of course, that doesn't make it any easier to take such a decision,” said Schelde. I thought this part was interesting; > ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trump's policies. A spokesperson said that they could not comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “protect the interests of our participants.” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell, which could reduce the value of the investment. Refusing to comment as to why, sounds like they're planning to sell off more?",

      "selftext_processed": "Transelated version The civil service pension fund ABP holds significantly less US debt than it did in March 2025 just before President Trump imposed import tariffs around the world . This is evident from their most recent investment overview which ABP always publishes with a threemonth delay . At the end of March the value of US government bonds in ABPs books was still more than €29 billion . At the end of September ABP was lending only €19 billion to the US more than a third less . Experts believe that such a rapid reduction reflects a lack of confidence in the financial stability of the US . The billions that are no_longer invested in US government bonds are instead being lent to the Netherlands and Germany . During the same period ABP lent an additional €3 billion to the Netherlands and more than €6 billion to Germany . In an interview with Fox News yesterday Trump threatened “ major retaliation ” if European countries sell US stocks or bonds . With around €500 billion in pension funds ABP is the largest fund in the Netherlands and also an important institutional investor worldwide . Multiple factors The question is whether ABP is deliberately withdrawing money from America or whether the amount lent has decreased in value . Rising interest rates on government bonds for example can depress their value . In addition the new Dutch pension system may also play a role . Pension funds are now allowed to invest more riskily than before and are therefore likely to be selling off relatively safe bonds . In this case the higher interest rates are not_playing a major role according to pension experts . Shortly after Trumps announcement of import tariffs in April 2025 bond interest rates rose sharply but that increase has been virtually wiped out . So that would only explain to a very limited extent why US bonds are recorded at a much lower value says Bas Werker professor of pensions and affiliated with the pension think tank Netspar . Nor does the phasing out of bonds due to the new pension system seem to be on the agenda at ABP according to Jacintha van Bijnen of pension advisor AON “ If you exchange US bonds for European bonds you are not_disposing of bonds. ” Selling ABPs deliberate policy i.e . selling or not_repurchasing therefore seems to play a major role . “ Trumps unpredictability and in a broader sense the increasing geopolitical uncertainty are leading pension funds to take a more critical look than before at their financial and nonfinancial resilience ” says Pim Zomerdijk of investment advisor Sprenkels . ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trumps policies . A spokesperson said that they could not_comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “ protect the interests of our participants. ” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell which could reduce the value of the investment . ABP seeks stability in order to invest and protect pension funds effectively . “ That is what our investment mix is aimed at ” said the spokesperson . Government bonds are generally considered to be a hedge against sharp fluctuations in the stock markets and currencies . US debt For decades the US has been considered the safe haven of the financial world but rising government spending is increasing the national debt . This is raising doubts about whether America is still able to repay those debts . High debt is not_a problem as long as enough countries investors and individuals are willing to hold dollars . Trumps import tariffs are putting pressure on trade with other countries . Since his second term as president the value of the dollar has fallen by more than 10 percent . Trump is also putting pressure on the central bank the Fed to lower interest rates and is threatening to dismiss Fed Chairman Jerome Powell . This fall the Dutch Central Bank also warned of the risk of financial instability and weaker US government bonds . Danish pension funds This week it was announced that two pension funds from Denmark have sold their US government bonds . These are funds in which teachers and academics accrue pension rights . A pension fund from Greenland has also said it wants to withdraw investments from the US in response to Trumps threat to take Greenland . “ This decision is the result of weak US public finances ” said Anders Schelde head of investments at the Danish teachers pension fund . According to him it is a matter of risk management . The money is now being invested in less risky investments . Like ABP the Danish teachers pension fund says that the disposal of US debt securities is not_directly linked to the rising tensions between the US and Europe . Nevertheless the two can not be viewed entirely separately “ Of course that doesnt make it any easier to take such a decision ” said Schelde . I thought this part was interesting ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trumps policies . A spokesperson said that they could not_comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “ protect the interests of our participants. ” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell which could reduce the value of the investment . Refusing to comment as to why sounds like theyre planning to sell off more"

      "title": "USA DEBT issue Global Debt!",
      "selftext": "It’s funny looking back at how many times people have panicked about the national debt. We freaked out at 1 trillion, then 5, then 10, 20, 30… every single milestone was supposed to be “the breaking point.” And nothing happened. Markets kept going, the dollar very volatile but always ended up OK even strong at points, the world keeps buying Treasuries. Even though headlines always said they will dump The big thing most people miss is that government debt doesn’t work like personal debt. Countries don’t pay it off like a credit card. They roll it over forever. What matters isn’t the number, it’s whether the world trusts your currency and wants your bonds. For the U.S., that answer is yes, and has been for decades. Treasuries are basically the plumbing of the entire global financial system. Banks, funds, foreign governments, the repo market, insurance companies, they all need Treasuries as collateral. If the U.S. ever stopped issuing debt, the global economy would actually fall apart. People don’t realize how central it is. And the U.S. issues debt in dollars. That alone changes the entire conversation. A country can’t “go bankrupt” on debt it owes in its own currency. The real constraint isn’t the debt number, it’s inflation and interest costs. As long as those are manageable, the size of the debt doesn’t mean much. Just a Number! Plus, every major country is in the same boat or worse. Japan is over 250 percent debt to GDP. Italy is around 140 percent. China has a massive pile of hidden local and off book debt. Nobody collapses because the modern financial world literally runs on this system. At the end of the day, the U.S. still has the reserve currency, the biggest capital markets, the most trusted debt, and the tech and military power that props the whole thing up. The debt number could be 60 trillion and people would still be buying Treasuries. So yeah, after freaking out at every milestone for 40 years, it’s pretty clear the number is mostly just a number. The structure underneath is what actually matters. Please explain what if I missed anything ??",

Markets kept going the dollar very volatile but always ended up OK even strong at points the world keeps buying Treasuries . Even though headlines always said they will dump The big thing most people miss is that government debt doesn ’ t work like personal debt . Countries don ’ t pay it off like a credit card . They roll it over forever . What matters isn ’ t the number it ’ s whether the world trusts your currency and wants your bonds . For the U.S. that answer is yes and has been for decades . Treasuries are basically the plumbing of the entire global financial system . Banks funds foreign governments the repo market insurance companies they all need Treasuries as collateral . If the U.S. ever stopped issuing debt the global economy would actually fall apart . People don ’ t realize how central it is . And the U.S. issues debt in dollars . That alone changes the entire conversation . A country can ’ t “ go bankrupt ” on debt it owes in its own currency . The real constraint isn ’ t the debt number it ’ s inflation and interest costs . As long as those are manageable the size of the debt doesn ’ t mean much . Just a Number Plus every major country is in the same boat or worse . Japan is over 250 percent debt to GDP . Italy is around 140 percent . China has a massive pile of hidden local and off book debt . Nobody_collapses because the modern financial world literally runs on this system . At the end of the day the U.S. still has the reserve currency the biggest capital markets the most trusted debt and the tech and military power that props the whole thing up . The debt number could be 60 trillion and people would still be buying Treasuries . So yeah after freaking out at every milestone for 40 years it ’ s pretty clear the number is mostly just a number . The structure underneath is what actually matters . Please explain what if I missed anything"

      "selftext": "[]( MANAGEMENT IS NOT INSANE, THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS Dilution isn't *as* bad as it seems, as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year, but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing Snapchat glasses are releasing this year If the glasses fail and he scraps them, Snapchat saves roughly $1B a year in R&D, turns cash-flow positive, slows dilution, buys back more stock, and the market probably re-rates the company. If the glasses actually work, the upside is even bigger. Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never scrapped the project, but I believe this time is different. Looking back at 2016, this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no other tech giant had entered the arena. They rushed a product into a market that wasn’t ready, with technology that was too early for its time. The versions failed for simple reasons, including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn’t advanced enough. By 2021, while they finally had actual augmented reality, the battery life was horrible. One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $400 million/year deal with Perplexity. Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat, and this is huge for both companies. Young people love AI and they love Snapchat. It’s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity, likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year. It’s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity’s AI in its glasses. Another thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage. Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat+ for a small premium. This is huge, as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memory/storage features, and soon they will be charging for it. Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company, but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave. **Q2 2025 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): \\~$2.87 / 3 ≈ $0.96 per user per month** Snapchat+ is $3.99 per month. For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs, just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back. So the answer to my question is: yes, the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave, from a financial standpoint. And let’s be honest, the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal. They likely won’t save their photos to the app, but users will still use the app. One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don’t want to pay is that they’ll end up saving storage costs for the company, lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG. Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for “Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. We completed this program in May 2025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $500.6 million, including costs associated with the repurchases.” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2025, Snap had $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This means dilution, despite still being high, is much lower than what others are reporting. They bought back $500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025. RSUs were valued at $1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $1 billion in 2024–2025, which is by no means low, but it’s important to mention that no one mentions the buybacks. Numbers are better, everything from EPS, revenue is better then 2022, but the stock is down 50% from this time, primarily due to them burning cash (which will end once they release these glasses) and Apple's ad policy change Snapchat+ is growing steadily, making them 700 million/year A question many are asking is why Snapchat+ was released in 2022, yet the stock declined massively. This thought process is completely correct, but it’s important to look at why they’ve had massive drops during this time. Apple’s IDFA (privacy) changes, the post-pandemic tech stock drops, and the large cash burned on R&D were the main reasons for the stock dropping. However, a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money, and that they’re stepping away to other business models, which is huge. Snapchat is innovatingevery quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and non-paid subscribers. Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company, and Snapchat is not letting their app die.",

If the glasses actually work the upside is even bigger . Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never_scrapped the project but I believe this time is different . Looking back at 2016 this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no_other tech giant had entered the arena . They rushed a product into a market that wasn ’ t ready with technology that was too early for its time . The versions failed for simple reasons including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn ’ t advanced enough . By 2021 while they finally had actual augmented reality the battery life was horrible . One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $ 400 millionyear deal with Perplexity . Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat and this is huge for both companies . Young people love AI and they love Snapchat . It ’ s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year . It ’ s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity ’ s AI in its glasses . Another thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage . Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat for a small premium . This is huge as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memorystorage features and soon they will be charging for it . Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave . Q2 2025 ARPU Average Revenue Per User $ 2.87 3 ≈ $ 0.96 per user per month Snapchat is $ 3.99 per month . For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back . So the answer to my question is yes the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave from a financial standpoint . And let ’ s be honest the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal . They likely won ’ t save their photos to the app but users will still use the app . One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don ’ t want to pay is that they ’ ll end up saving storage costs for the company lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG . Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for “ Stock Repurchases In October 2024 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 500.0 million of our Class A common stock . We completed this program in May 2025 . For the nine months ended September 30 2025 we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $ 500.6 million including costs associated with the repurchases. ” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents . As of September 30 2025 Snap had $ 3.0 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities . This means dilution despite still being high is much lower than what others are reporting . They bought back $ 500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025 . RSUs were valued at $ 1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $ 1 billion in 2024–2025 which is by no_means low but it ’ s important to mention that no_one mentions the buybacks .

This thought process is completely correct but it ’ s important to look at why they ’ ve had massive drops during this time . Apple ’ s IDFA privacy changes the postpandemic tech stock drops and the large cash burned on RD were the main reasons for the stock dropping . However a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money and that they ’ re stepping away to other business models which is huge .

If the glasses actually work, the upside is even bigger. Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never scrapped the project, but I believe this time is different.

By 2021, while they finally had actual augmented reality, the battery life was horrible. One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $400 million/year deal with Perplexity. Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat, and this is huge for both companies. Young people love AI and they love Snapchat. It’s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity, likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year. It’s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity’s AI in its glasses. One thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage. Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat+ for a small premium. This is huge, as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memory/storage features, and soon they will be charging for it. Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company, but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave. **Q2 2025 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): \\~$2.87 / 3 ≈ $0.96 per user per month** Snapchat+ is $3.99 per month. For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs, just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back. So the answer to my question is: yes, the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave, from a financial standpoint. And let’s be honest—the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal. They likely won’t save their photos to the app, but users will still use the app. One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don’t want to pay is that they’ll end up saving storage costs for the company, lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG. Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for. Meta’s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms, unlike Snapchat’s, which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers; it’s not just a status thing. “Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock.

      "selftext_processed": "MANAGEMENT IS NOT_INSANE THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS Dilution isnt as bad as it seems as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing Snapchat glasses are releasing this year IT DOSENT MATTER IF THE GLASSES FLOP IT DOES NOT_IF IT FLOPS ITS GOOD EVEN If the glasses fail he will scraps them Snapchat will save roughly $ 1B a year in RD turns cashflow positive slows dilution buys back more stock and the market probably rerates the company . If the glasses actually work the upside is even bigger . Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never_scrapped the project but I believe this time is different . Looking back at 2016 this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no_other tech giant had entered the arena . They rushed a product into a market that wasn ’ t ready with technology that was too early for its time . The versions failed for simple reasons including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn ’ t advanced enough . By 2021 while they finally had actual augmented reality the battery life was horrible . One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $ 400 millionyear deal with Perplexity . Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat and this is huge for both companies . Young people love AI and they love Snapchat . It ’ s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year . It ’ s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity ’ s AI in its glasses . One thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage . Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat for a small premium . This is huge as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memorystorage features and soon they will be charging for it . Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave . Q2 2025 ARPU Average Revenue Per User $ 2.87 3 ≈ $ 0.96 per user per month Snapchat is $ 3.99 per month . For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back . So the answer to my question is yes the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave from a financial standpoint . And let ’ s be honest—the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal . They likely won ’ t save their photos to the app but users will still use the app . One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don ’ t want to pay is that they ’ ll end up saving storage costs for the company lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG . Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for . Meta ’ s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms unlike Snapchat ’ s which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers it ’ s not_just a status thing . “ Stock Repurchases In October 2024 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 500.0 million of our Class A common stock . We completed this program in May 2025 . For the nine months ended September 30 2025 we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $ 500.6 million including costs associated with the repurchases. ” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents . As of September 30 2025 Snap had $ 3.0 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities . This means dilution despite still being high is much lower than what others are reporting . They bought back $ 500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025 . RSUs were valued at $ 1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $ 1 billion in 2024–2025 which is by no_means low but it ’ s important to mention that no_one mentions the buybacks . Numbers are better everything from EPS revenue is better then 2022 but the stock is down 50 % from this time primarily due to them burning cash which will end once they release these glasses and Apples ad policy change Snapchat is growing steadily making them 700 millionyear A question many are asking is why Snapchat was released in 2022 yet the stock declined massively . This thought process is completely correct but it ’ s important to look at why they ’ ve had massive drops during this time . Apple ’ s IDFA privacy changes the postpandemic tech stock drops and the large cash burned on RD were the main reasons for the stock dropping . However a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money and that they ’ re stepping away to other business models which is huge . Snapchat is innovating—every quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and nonpaid subscribers . Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company and Snapchat is not_letting their app die ."

      "selftext": "Been investing for about 5 years now and I've noticed something weird about myself. I used to check my portfolio like 10 times a day, get stressed about red days, and try to time every little dip. My returns were mediocre. Then I realized I was basically gambling with a fundamental investing mindset, which is the worst combo. So I changed my approach. Instead of watching price action, I started tracking the stuff that actually moves markets long term. SEC filings, earnings calls, insider trades, congressional disclosures for companies I own. Sounds boring but it's genuinely changed how I think about my positions. Here's what I mean. I own some tech stocks and I used to panic when they'd drop 5% on some random Tuesday. But once I started actually reading the 10-Ks and 10-Qs, I realized most of those drops were noise. The fundamentals hadn't changed. On the flip side, I caught some early warning signs in other holdings by noticing patterns in insider selling that I would've completely missed if I was just staring at charts. The problem is this takes forever. I'm a software engineer so I'm used to automating stuff, and I got frustrated manually digging through SEC databases and trying to piece together what's actually happening with my holdings. That's when I realized how much of an advantage institutional investors have. They have teams of people doing this research. Retail investors like us are basically flying blind if we're just looking at price and volume. I started experimenting with different ways to streamline this. Tried a few different research tools and platforms. Some are clunky, some are expensive, some just regurgitate news headlines without any real insight. What actually helped was finding tools that could pull data from actual sources (SEC filings, exchange data, that kind of thing) and surface what's relevant to my specific holdings. Sounds simple but most tools just show you generic market news. Anyway, my point is this. If you're serious about fundamental investing, you need to actually know what's happening with your companies. Not the price, the actual business. And if you're like me and don't have 20 hours a week to dig through filings, you need to find a way to make that research efficient. Otherwise you're just guessing. My 1Y returns are up 29% and my 3Y average is 22%. I'm not saying that's because of this approach alone, but I'm definitely more confident in my positions now because I actually understand them. And I sleep better at night not checking my portfolio every 5 minutes. Anyone else struggle with this? How do you guys stay on top of the fundamentals without it consuming your entire life?",

But once I started actually reading the 10Ks and 10Qs I realized most of those drops were noise . The fundamentals hadnt changed . On the flip side I caught some early warning signs in other holdings by noticing patterns in insider selling that I wouldve completely missed if I was just staring at charts . The problem is this takes forever . Im a software engineer so Im used to automating stuff and I got frustrated manually digging through SEC databases and trying to piece together whats actually happening with my holdings . Thats when I realized how much of an advantage institutional investors have . They have teams of people doing this research . Retail investors like us are basically flying blind if were just looking at price and volume . I started experimenting with different ways to streamline this . Tried a few different research tools and platforms . Some are clunky some are expensive some just regurgitate news headlines without any real insight . What actually helped was finding tools that could pull data from actual sources SEC filings exchange data that kind of thing and surface whats relevant to my specific holdings . Sounds simple but most tools just show you generic market news . Anyway my point is this . If youre serious about fundamental investing you need to actually know whats happening with your companies . Not_the price the actual business . And if youre like me and dont have 20 hours a week to dig through filings you need to find a way to make that research efficient . Otherwise youre just guessing . My 1Y returns are up 29 % and my 3Y average is 22 % . Im not_saying thats because of this approach alone but Im definitely more confident in my positions now because I actually understand them . And I sleep better at night not_checking my portfolio every 5 minutes . Anyone else struggle with this How do you guys stay on top of the fundamentals without it consuming your entire life"

      "selftext": "**EDIT:** You guys rightfully tore me a mathematical asshole which I appreciate. After this post caught a little traction my 400 RKT shares magically appeared back into my account so maybe someone from RH saw this or they realized they fucked up, all is well now ________ This happened yesterday, January 21. I had 400 shares of RKT with an average price of $22.88. I was going to sell covered calls, I clicked the \"Trade\" button and saw the \"Ladder\" option which I had never seen before so wanted to check it out. This is the Ladder page on Robinhood As you can see the default setting is \"1 share\". I clicked \"Buy MKT\" to see how it worked and a popup came up saying something to the effect of 'Close and return' but I can't remember exactly what it said, I do know it said Close for sure and no buy or sell confirmation. I clicked it and the app immediately sold all 400 shares of my RKT stock at $21.28 resulting in a loss of -$651.50. After the trade happened I later checked the settings on the Ladder page and the \"Auto-send - Place orders without a confirmation\" was unchecked (it is by default) so I should've been to sent a confirmation page to confirm the order but I was not. Today I checked the Ladder page and now when you click \"Buy MKT\" it takes you to a totally separate page to confirm the order, input number of shares, set limit price, etc. I was not sent to this page yesterday. I spoke to RH support and was told they would talk to their back office to have the trade busted and my shares returned. I received an email today saying the back office was not able to bust the trade. Do I have any recourse here? I'm out 400 shares and -$651.50 directly caused by a bug on their app, isn't this a FINRA violation? Should I contact Robinhood again or file a complaint?

I clicked it and the app immediately sold all 400 shares of my RKT stock at $ 21.28 resulting in a loss of $ 651.50 . After the trade happened I later checked the settings on the Ladder page and the Autosend Place orders without a confirmation was unchecked it is by default so I shouldve been to sent a confirmation page to confirm the order but I was not_Today I checked the Ladder page and now when you click Buy MKT it takes you to a totally separate page to confirm the order input number of shares set limit price etc . I was not_sent to this page yesterday . I spoke to RH support and was told they would talk to their back office to have the trade busted and my shares returned . I received an email today saying the back office was not_able to bust the trade . Do I have any recourse here Im out 400 shares and $ 651.50 directly caused by a bug on their app isnt this a FINRA violation Should I contact Robinhood again or file a complaint Support chat and email I received Chat Email"

      "selftext": "As English is not my first language, I have used Gemini to help me. But you know what, see the positions first, cause that is all you degens care about and now the part which 99% of you guys wont read: So I have been digging through the biotech trash heap looking for gold, and I think I found the only ticker that Mr. Market is completely sleeping on. We are talking about **Altimmune ($ALT)**. If you’ve been watching the GLP-1 space (Lilly, Novo), you know the \"fat loss\" trade is crowded. But $ALT just pivoted to the holy grail: **MASH (liver disease) + Weight Loss.** And the setup right now is looking like a powder keg waiting for a match. Here is the DD. # 1. The Data is absolute fire (FDA Agrees) The market punished this thing last year because they wanted \"just another weight loss drug.\" $ALT gave them something better: **Pemvidutide.** * **BTD CONFIRMED:** As of Jan 5, 2026, the FDA granted them **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)** for MASH. This is huge. It means the FDA sees \"substantial improvement\" over existing therapies. This is also means chances of approval are now over 75%, FDA wants this drug **LET ME SAY THIS IN CAPS - BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL, only around 1/3 of applications gets accepted, and it tells big Pharma, FDA wants this drug, come fucking buy** * **The Kicker:** Unlike Madrigal’s drug (Rezdiffra) which just treats the liver, $ALT’s drug shreds fat too. Patients hit **7.5% weight loss at 48 weeks** on the high dose, and the chart showed *no plateau* (meaning they were still losing weight). It’s a two-for-one special: Fix the liver, lose the gut. # 2. The \"For Sale\" Sign is Blinking This is the most bullish part. Look at the C-Suite changes. They aren't building a 20-year dynasty; they are dressing the bride for a wedding. * **New CEO (Jan 2026):** Jerry Durso. Who is he? He was the CEO of Intercept Pharmaceuticals. **He literally just sold Intercept to Alfasigma.** He knows exactly how to package a liver drug for a buyout. * **New CFO (Nov 2024):** Greg Weaver. This guy was the CFO at Sirna (sold to Merck) and ILEX (sold to Genzyme). * **Translation:** You don't hire a liquidation squad if you plan to run independent trials for the next decade. # 3. Valuation is a Joke (The Value Play) Let’s look at the comps. This is why it’s the best value on the board. * **Madrigal ($MDGL):** Multi-Billion market cap. (Commercial stage, but expensive). * **Viking ($VKTX):** \\~$8B+ market cap. * Novo also got some company in this space for billions * **Altimmune ($ALT):** **\\~$450M - $550M Market Cap.** It is trading at cash + a handshake. If this gets even *half* the valuation of its peers, it’s a multi-bagger. The Phase 3 setup is fully aligned with the FDA. The ship is loaded. # 4. The Catalyst & The Risk * **The Hype:** The stock started heating up at the JPM Healthcare Conference (Jan 2026). Big Pharma is swimming in cash and looking for MASH assets because their patents are expiring. * **The Risk (The Bear Case):** Cash. They have \\~$210M (as of late 2025). Phase 3 is expensive. * *Scenario A:* They dilute. Stock dips, we cry, then it recovers. * *Scenario B:* Partnership (Non-dilutive cash). Stock moons. * *Scenario C:* Buyout. We retire. # Summary They have the **Data** (BTD granted), they have the **Management** (literally hired guys who sell companies), and they have the **Market Cap** (insanely low compared to peers). This isn't a pure obesity play anymore; it's the leading **MASH play** that makes you skinny. **TL;DR:** * **Ticker:** $ALT * **Catalyst:** FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation + Phase 3 start. * **Upside:** 3-5x to catch up to peer valuations. * **Risk:** Cash burn/Dilution (unless they partner/sell first). * **Prediction:** Jerry Durso didn't take this job to work a 9-5. He took it to sign a deal. bonus - 21% SI Not financial advice, but this could 2x to 10x , who the hell knows, but is should fly baby fly It ran 20 percent today for a reason.... Many people saying AI bots. Check my history, I am as degen and idiotic as any other regard. Now who comments on the threads, I can't control. Bonus - weight loss means bigger peepee Edit - if you guys made money take your profits. It's run harder than I thought, still keep skin in the game.",

      "selftext_processed": "As English is not_my first language I have used Gemini to help me . But you know what see the positions first cause that is all you degens care about and now the part which 99 % of you guys wont read So I have been digging through the biotech trash heap looking for gold and I think I found the only ticker that Mr. Market is completely sleeping on . We are talking about Altimmune $ ALT . If you ’ ve been watching the GLP1 space Lilly Novo you know the fat loss trade is crowded . But $ ALT just pivoted to the holy grail MASH liver disease Weight Loss . And the setup right now is looking like a powder keg waiting for a match . Here is the DD . 1 . The Data is absolute fire FDA Agrees The market punished this thing last year because they wanted just another weight loss drug . $ ALT gave them something better Pemvidutide . BTD CONFIRMED As of Jan 5 2026 the FDA granted them Breakthrough Therapy Designation BTD for MASH . This is huge . It means the FDA sees substantial improvement over existing therapies . This is also means chances of approval are now over 75 % FDA wants this drug LET ME SAY THIS IN CAPS BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL only around 13 of applications gets accepted and it tells big Pharma FDA wants this drug come fucking buy The Kicker Unlike Madrigal ’ s drug Rezdiffra which just treats the liver $ ALT ’ s drug shreds fat too . Patients hit 7.5 % weight loss at 48 weeks on the high dose and the chart showed no plateau meaning they were still losing weight . It ’ s a twoforone special Fix the liver lose the gut . 2 . The For Sale Sign is Blinking This is the most bullish part . Look at the CSuite changes . They arent building a 20year dynasty they are dressing the bride for a wedding . New CEO Jan 2026 Jerry Durso . Who is he He was the CEO of Intercept Pharmaceuticals . He literally just sold Intercept to Alfasigma . He knows exactly how to package a liver drug for a buyout . New CFO Nov 2024 Greg Weaver . This guy was the CFO at Sirna sold to Merck and ILEX sold to Genzyme . Translation You dont hire a liquidation squad if you plan to run independent trials for the next decade . 3 . Valuation is a Joke The Value Play Let ’ s look at the comps . This is why it ’ s the best value on the board . Madrigal $ MDGL MultiBillion market cap . Commercial stage but expensive . Viking $ VKTX $ 8B market cap . Novo also got some company in this space for billions Altimmune $ ALT $ 450M $ 550M Market Cap . It is trading at cash a handshake . If this gets even half the valuation of its peers it ’ s a multibagger . The Phase 3 setup is fully aligned with the FDA . The ship is loaded . 4 . The Catalyst The Risk The Hype The stock started heating up at the JPM Healthcare Conference Jan 2026 . Big Pharma is swimming in cash and looking for MASH assets because their patents are expiring . The Risk The Bear Case Cash . They have $ 210M as of late 2025 . Phase 3 is expensive . Scenario A They dilute . Stock dips we cry then it recovers . Scenario B Partnership Nondilutive cash . Stock moons . Scenario C Buyout . We retire . Summary They have the Data BTD granted they have the Management literally hired guys who sell companies and they have the Market Cap insanely low compared to peers . This isnt a pure obesity play anymore its the leading MASH play that makes you skinny . TLDR Ticker $ ALT Catalyst FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation Phase 3 start . Upside 35x to catch up to peer valuations . Risk Cash burnDilution unless they partnersell first . Prediction Jerry Durso didnt take this job to work a 95 . He took it to sign a deal . bonus 21 % SI Not_financial advice but this could 2x to 10x who the hell knows but is should fly baby fly It ran 20 percent today for a reason .... Many people saying AI bots . Check my history I am as degen and idiotic as any other regard . Now who comments on the threads I cant control . Bonus weight loss means bigger peepee Edit if you guys made money take your profits . Its run harder than I thought still keep skin in the game ."

Expect Wall Street to poke at why Q1 guidance is below expectations in both sales and margins during the company’s conference call. The good news? EPS for last quarter came in at $.15, significantly topping estiates of $.08. Revenue of $13.67 billion topped estimates of about $13.4 billion. The results for last quarter look solid. The problem is Q1 guidance, which is $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion. At the midpoint that’s below Wall Street’s estimate of $12.51 billion. Q1 EPS guidance is also poor.

From what I’ve saw the annual growth average is 10% so even just taking 5% out each year would be $50,000 of passive income while your money still grows in the stock. Now a lot of this does depend on how the fund does that year, but it’s a real thought. I’d love to know from people who actually know what they’re talking about. Thanks guys",

From what I ’ ve saw the annual growth average is 10 % so even just taking 5 % out each year would be $ 50000 of passive income while your money still grows in the stock . Now a lot of this does depend on how the fund does that year but it ’ s a real thought . I ’ d love to know from people who actually know what they ’ re talking about . Thanks guys"

      "selftext": "I’m looking to propose to my girlfriend of four years this year, and have put down two deposits for an engagement ring (one for the band, one for the diamond). I’m currently low on cash in my bank account to finish paying the rest of it off. I have a RH brokerage account that holds \\~20% VOO and the rest of it is individual stocks (TSM, WMT, RKLB, etc). I use this account to hold onto stocks long term. If I sell all of my VOO, I will have enough money to pay off the rest of the ring. I plan on getting back into S&P 500 exposure either through my job’s 401K plan or a Roth IRA. Or would it be better to hold VOO and sell some of the individual stocks I own? Please let me know what you guys think. Thank you! Edit: Want to clarify here since a lot of people are asking: the engagement ring is a lab grown diamond ring, only need $2,000 to pay off the rest of it, which is about how much I have in VOO.

Especially gold and silver have lately seen incredible inflows due to the lack of issuer risk. Are there any ETFs ex-US or stocks you'd recommend in this environment?

Basically this trade involves the rotation out of U.S. risk assets and treasuries due to the decline of the rule of law imperialist ambitions and a possible break with NATO and other allies . Especially gold and silver have lately seen incredible inflows due to the lack of issuer risk . Are there any ETFs exUS or stocks youd recommend in this environment How are you hedging the decline of the western bloc"

      "selftext": "As of writing this post gold is \\~$4900/oz and platinum is \\~$2550/oz. Platinum is estimated to be 30x rarer than gold, why is it 1/2 the cost? Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years. It has constant demand from central banks and will always be seen as the go to as a safe haven. There will always be a premium for it but 200% relative to platinum, a scarcer mineral, seems excessive. Silver I think is more comparable to platinum, it isn’t viewed in the same light as gold and doesn’t deserve the premium gold has. Yet silver has surged more than platinum, why? Perhaps it’s due to it being a cheaper alternative to gold but for every 1 oz of platinum mined there are 139 oz of silver mined. Based solely on that, silver is \\~$96, making platinum 26x more expensive. It surely has room to grow higher based only on scarcity. Platinum is primarily used in the automotive industry for catalytic converters. This provides a baseline demand and the market has seen a significant supply deficit for the past few years. Solely on this, the supply constraints will push up prices. There’s also growth as it’s used in hydrogen fuel cells as AI demands an increase in power outputs. The world spending on defence is also projected to increase due to Trump and it’s also used in manufacturing for various defence products. I see an opportunity for price increases due to scarcity and use case growth with limited downside due to baseline demand not even being met.

      "title": "Cavvy Energy is 7x-ing it's Sulphur Revenue This Year - Does the Market Know?",
      "selftext": "Cavvy Energy (CVVY.TO), a Canadian energy company, has been locked in a awful contract for years. This deal required 80% of their sulphur production to be sold at $6/mt. Compare that to the current market value of $260/mt, and you can see how awful this deal is. This has meant Cavvy received an average of $34/mt for their sulphur last quarter against the $260/mt they could've gotten. This changes this year. In November, they entered into a new contract, wherein 1/3 of their suplhur will be sold at $225/mt, 1/3 between $205-$250/mt, and 1/3 at full market value. Averaged out, this'd put the price they get at around $250/mt, or 7.3x what they got last quarter. Cavvy currently produces around 1,100 mt/d, but can expand that to 1,400 mt/d at peak periods. Averaged at 1200 mt/d, it means Cavvy currently receives around $14M a year from sulphur, but with the new deal would be getting around $100M a year (perhaps slightly less when factoring in costs of sulphur storage and transfer, which the current $34/mt accounts for). Last year, Cavvy made around $30M a quarter in total NOI, across all areas of their business: already a significant increase from the year before. Accounting for the new suplhur pricing, they could be adding $20M per quarter to that number, or around +60% compared to last year, or a total $200M NOI compared to $120M (although yearly figures seem to shift quite a lot for Cavvy, so it may not be indicative). They've been working down their debt every quarter, to currently $160M. The large uptick in revenue would certainly help clear that faster. Their net income per quarter often brushes break-even, or dips into the negatives somewhat, but this revenue increase should put them comfortably above 0. It seems like they'll break even for last year, which again, should put them in the green this year. At C$260M cap at the moment, it wouldn't take much profit to make them undervalued. The stock's already up 200% in the past year, and I think it could go higher. I will note that what values are in USD$ or Canadian $ is a bit blurry. The suplhur market price is in USD, but the market cap in C$, so numbers may vary a little.",

Accounting for the new suplhur pricing they could be adding $ 20M per quarter to that number or around 60 % compared to last year or a total $ 200M NOI compared to $ 120M although yearly figures seem to shift quite a lot for Cavvy so it may not_be indicative . Theyve been working down their debt every quarter to currently $ 160M . The large uptick in revenue would certainly help clear that faster . Their net income per quarter often brushes breakeven or dips into the negatives somewhat but this revenue increase should put them comfortably above 0 . It seems like theyll break even for last year which again should put them in the green this year . At C $ 260M cap at the moment it wouldnt take much profit to make them undervalued . The stocks already up 200 % in the past year and I think it could go higher . I will note that what values are in USD $ or Canadian $ is a bit blurry . The suplhur market price is in USD but the market cap in C $ so numbers may vary a little ."

      "selftext": "# The Monetization of Inertia: Why Davos 2026 wasn't a capitulation, but a signal that Microsoft is winning by servicing corporate inefficiency rather than fixing it. Davos 2026 take: Microsoft isn't \"slowing down.\" They are winning by letting corporate inertia kill SaaS. Everyone is talking about how \"depressing\" or \"pragmatic\" Nadella sounded at Davos this year. The narrative seems to be that the AI revolution is hitting a wall of supply-side issues or just slowing down. I think that's a total misread. I’ve been looking at the drop in SaaS valuations (Salesforce, Workday, Asana) vs Microsoft’s positioning, and honestly, MSFT isn't winning because their AI is \"smarter.\" They are winning because they are monetizing the fact that huge companies are too dysfunctional to change. Here is what I’m seeing: **1. The \"Middle-Management Firewall\"** We all thought AI would come in and optimize inefficiencies. But in the real world (logistics, law, old-school manufacturing), the data is such a mess that AI models just choke on it. Instead of fixing the data, companies are just buying Copilot to layer on top of the mess. It’s not a revolution; it’s a patch. Microsoft realized they don't need to fix the enterprise; they just need to tax its inefficiency. **2. SaaS is bleeding out** The whole \"seat-based\" pricing model is dying. You used to pay for Asana or Salesforce so humans could click buttons to manage work. But if AI agents start doing the work, you don't need the GUI. You need the API and the data. Microsoft owns the OS and the data layer (Graph/Office). The \"middleman\" apps that just manage complexity are losing their moat. That’s why their stocks are tanking while MSFT holds. **3. Legacy is the Moat** This is the most contrarian part: The sheer ugliness of legacy infrastructure (VBA macros, old ERPs, unstructured PDFs) is actually a defense mechanism. Agile AI startups can't integrate with this garbage. Microsoft can, because they built half of it. They are effectively selling \"safety\" to dinosaurs who are too scared to rebuild their stack. **My take:** This isn't a tech stagnation. It's a shift from a war of maneuver (startups breaking things) to a war of attrition. Microsoft is digging in. The \"inertia\" of the Global 2000 companies is the biggest asset class in the world right now, and Nadella is the only one servicing it. Thoughts? Is legacy debt a long-term moat or just a temporary speed bump before agents eat everything? *I wrote this because I believe we are missing the structural shift while focusing on rhetoric. Wondering if this \"inertia as defense\" is a temporary speedbump or the permanent state of our high-tech stagnation.*",

Davos 2026 take Microsoft isnt slowing down . They are winning by letting corporate inertia kill SaaS . Everyone is talking about how depressing or pragmatic Nadella sounded at Davos this year . The narrative seems to be that the AI revolution is hitting a wall of supplyside issues or just slowing down . I think thats a total misread . I ’ ve been looking at the drop in SaaS valuations Salesforce Workday Asana vs Microsoft ’ s positioning and honestly MSFT isnt winning because their AI is smarter . They are winning because they are monetizing the fact that huge companies are too dysfunctional to change . Here is what I ’ m seeing 1 . The MiddleManagement Firewall We all thought AI would come in and optimize inefficiencies . But in the real world logistics law oldschool manufacturing the data is such a mess that AI models just choke on it . Instead of fixing the data companies are just buying Copilot to layer on top of the mess . It ’ s not_a revolution it ’ s a patch . Microsoft realized they dont need to fix the enterprise they just need to tax its inefficiency . 2 . SaaS is bleeding out The whole seatbased pricing model is dying . You used to pay for Asana or Salesforce so humans could click buttons to manage work . But if AI agents start doing the work you dont need the GUI . You need the API and the data . Microsoft owns the OS and the data layer GraphOffice . The middleman apps that just manage complexity are losing their moat . That ’ s why their stocks are tanking while MSFT holds . 3 . Legacy is the Moat This is the most contrarian part The sheer ugliness of legacy infrastructure VBA macros old ERPs unstructured PDFs is actually a defense mechanism . Agile AI startups cant integrate with this garbage . Microsoft can because they built half of it . They are effectively selling safety to dinosaurs who are too scared to rebuild their stack . My take This isnt a tech stagnation . Its a shift from a war of maneuver startups breaking things to a war of attrition . Microsoft is digging in . The inertia of the Global 2000 companies is the biggest asset class in the world right now and Nadella is the only one servicing it . Thoughts Is legacy debt a longterm moat or just a temporary speed bump before agents eat everything I wrote this because I believe we are missing the structural shift while focusing on rhetoric . Wondering if this inertia as defense is a temporary speedbump or the permanent state of our hightech stagnation ."

      "selftext": "Equities moved slightly higher yesterday, but it didn’t feel like a “relief rally” driven by resolved headlines. If anything, markets seem to be pricing *less immediate downside*, not new certainty. There has been a lot of noise around geopolitics, trade rhetoric, and election-related risk, but no concrete policy shifts or confirmed deals that materially change the macro outlook. Tariff risks for Europe haven’t been removed, and broader trade uncertainty is still very much on the table. What likely supported stocks was positioning and rates. Bond yields stayed contained, volatility remained muted, and there was no catalyst forcing risk-off behavior. In that environment, even modest dip-buying can push indices higher. To me this looks more like patience than confidence. Markets aren’t panicking, but they’re also not celebrating. Until we see real policy clarity or stronger macro data, this feels like a range-bound grind where headline risk remains asymmetric. Interested how others read it. Is this just positioning ahead of upcoming data, or do you see genuine upside conviction building here?",

If anything markets seem to be pricing less immediate downside not_new certainty . There has been a lot of noise around geopolitics trade rhetoric and electionrelated risk but no_concrete policy shifts or confirmed deals that materially change the macro outlook . Tariff risks for Europe haven ’ t been removed and broader trade uncertainty is still very much on the table . What likely supported stocks was positioning and rates . Bond yields stayed contained volatility remained muted and there was no_catalyst forcing riskoff behavior . In that environment even modest dipbuying can push indices higher . To me this looks more like patience than confidence . Markets aren ’ t panicking but they ’ re also not_celebrating . Until we see real policy clarity or stronger macro data this feels like a rangebound grind where headline risk remains asymmetric . Interested how others read it . Is this just positioning ahead of upcoming data or do you see genuine upside conviction building here"

If you had to choose one to \"buy the dip\" at this particular moment in time, which one would you choose? Or would you hold off for the potential that they keep dipping? I know no one has a crystal ball, etc etc, I am just asking for your own personal opinions. UPDATE: Thanks for all your advice. I bought both, but more ASTS.",

If you had to choose one to buy the dip at this particular moment in time which one would you choose Or would you hold off for the potential that they keep dipping I know no_one has a crystal ball etc etc I am just asking for your own personal opinions .

The Kwikpen has been available in international markets but they will offer them here in the states presumably for Medicare and Medicaid coverage . The most interesting thing is the MultiDose vial . This one is likely for LillyDirect and a shot across the bow to compounders . With a MultiDose vial you can now personalize your dosing with the branded drug . Mounjaro Zepbound"

      "title": "$ATEX A Play on Exclusive Rights to Smart Grid Radiocommunications Wavelength & Modernisation Needs",
      "selftext": "I'll preface this by saying, this is a play on increases in mass energy needs, the need for grid modernisation as a result, and the underlying processes that allow Smart Grids to operate. Anterix (ATEX) is a deep-value play on Smart Grids' needs for critical radio frequency communication. \\*\\***As of writing, ATEX holds the exclusive nationwide license for the 900 MHz band, a specialised frequency critical for the multi-trillion dollar US grid modernisation**.\\*\\* The current market cap sits at approximately $473 million, with the spectrum pipeline valued at nearly $3B across 60+ potential utility customers. Financial filings reveal a pivot toward profitability, with the company reporting a stellar EPS of $2.86 and increasing projected cash proceeds to $100 million from the previous $80 million guidance. On a business metrics and stock mathematics level, there is a significant valuation gap and a debt-free balance sheet. ATEX currently trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 4.9x, a solid discount compared to the telecom industry average of \\~16x. This undervaluation is further apparent when considering the company’s $250 million authorised share repurchase program, which remains active through to September 2026. \\***As of the most recent filings, over $227 million remains on this authorisation - a figure representing nearly 48% of the company's total market capitalisation**.\\* This suggests that as Anterix continues to execute its monetisation strategy, it has the liquidity to significantly reduce its share count, effectively creating a buyback floor that amplifies per-share value as revenue from long-term utility contracts scales. From a technical and operational standpoint, the turnaround is validated by accelerating contracted proceeds and strategic de-risking. The company has moved from a development phase into an execution phase, evidenced by the $147 million in contracted proceeds already on the books and the launch of TowerX with Crown Castle to speed up utility deployments. The stock chart reflects this momentum; after bottoming in late 2025 near $18, ATEX has established a strong ascending channel, with current technical support firming up around $23.50 - $24.00. With $39 million in cash and zero debt, Anterix is positioned to navigate the lumpy nature of spectrum deals while waiting for the market to re-rate its share price toward a fair value consensus of $50 - $55, which aligns with conservative spectrum-valuation methodologies of \\~$0.40/MHz-pop. \\*\\*Wireless Company Valuation\\*\\* *Conservative* If one applies a conservative $0.40/MHz pop math to Anterix’s nationwide footprint: 2.0 Billion MHz-pops x $0.40 = $800 Million (Spectrum Value) Add: \\~$40M Cash + \\~$140M in Contracted Receivables. Subtract: liabilities/burn. Divide by: \\~18-19 million shares. This calculation results in a price per share in the $50 range *Bull* At (already in contract with SDG&E) $2/MHz pop, this valuation quickly shifts to $200-250/ps Entry: $23-26 Target: $65 LFG 🍀🥸",

      "selftext_processed": "Ill preface this by saying this is a play on increases in mass energy needs the need for grid modernisation as a result and the underlying processes that allow Smart Grids to operate . Anterix ATEX is a deepvalue play on Smart Grids needs for critical radio frequency communication . As of writing ATEX holds the exclusive nationwide license for the 900 MHz band a specialised frequency critical for the multitrillion dollar US grid modernisation . The current market cap sits at approximately $ 473 million with the spectrum pipeline valued at nearly $ 3B across 60 potential utility customers . Financial filings reveal a pivot toward profitability with the company reporting a stellar EPS of $ 2.86 and increasing projected cash proceeds to $ 100 million from the previous $ 80 million guidance . On a business metrics and stock mathematics level there is a significant valuation gap and a debtfree balance sheet . ATEX currently trades at a trailing PE ratio of 4.9x a solid discount compared to the telecom industry average of 16x . This undervaluation is further apparent when considering the company ’ s $ 250 million authorised share repurchase program which remains active through to September 2026 . As of the most recent filings over $ 227 million remains on this authorisation a figure representing nearly 48 % of the companys total market capitalisation . This suggests that as Anterix continues to execute its monetisation strategy it has the liquidity to significantly reduce its share count effectively creating a buyback floor that amplifies pershare value as revenue from longterm utility contracts scales . From a technical and operational standpoint the turnaround is validated by accelerating contracted proceeds and strategic derisking . The company has moved from a development phase into an execution phase evidenced by the $ 147 million in contracted proceeds already on the books and the launch of TowerX with Crown Castle to speed up utility deployments . The stock chart reflects this momentum after bottoming in late 2025 near $ 18 ATEX has established a strong ascending channel with current technical support firming up around $ 23.50 $ 24.00 . With $ 39 million in cash and zero debt Anterix is positioned to navigate the lumpy nature of spectrum deals while waiting for the market to rerate its share price toward a fair value consensus of $ 50 $ 55 which aligns with conservative spectrumvaluation methodologies of $ 0.40MHzpop . Wireless Company Valuation Conservative If one applies a conservative $ 0.40MHz pop math to Anterix ’ s nationwide footprint 2.0 Billion MHzpops x $ 0.40 $ 800 Million Spectrum Value Add $ 40M Cash $ 140M in Contracted Receivables . Subtract liabilitiesburn . Divide by 1819 million shares . This calculation results in a price per share in the $ 50 range Bull At already in contract with SDGE $ 2MHz pop this valuation quickly shifts to $ 200250ps Entry $ 2326 Target $ 65 LFG 🍀🥸"

Notably, this rally wasn't a market-wide one. It was driven by major AI and robotics companies, including Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Hyundai Motor Company. This is interpreted as a concentrated rally driven by increased global AI investment and momentum in the semiconductor market, rather than a general market uptrend. I'm curious to hear your thoughts.

Various customers thought this move was outside their longterm contract agreements for deliveries which obviously was not_the case and VG is winning the arbitration cases Stock is up well over 10 % and after hours trading and Likely will move higher Great investment opportunity moving forward because there ’ s a lot of move to run in .

      "selftext": "(I’m long on Nvidia and a dozen other major AI related stocks. I’m also in various S&P positions and funds. Just a disclaimer.) Congress is one step closer to gaining the authority to review artificial intelligence chip sales to China, a move likely to open a rift with the Trump administration over plans to let Nvidia Corp. sell its powerful H200 processors to the world’s second largest economy. A House committee focused on foreign affairs approved bipartisan legislation Wednesday that calls for arms-sale style congressional oversight of advanced AI chip exports. The text, endorsed by the panel’s Republicans and Democrats, would outright ban sales of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips to China for two years, codifying existing export controls into law. The bill marks a response to President Donald Trump’s decision last month to ease longstanding export controls on China, a move aimed at spurring adoption of American AI technology in global markets but one that drew strenuous objections from national security hawks in Congress. Trump’s approval for Nvidia’s H200 sales to Chinese customers was formalized by a new rule issued last week by the Commerce Department. The panel approved the bill by a 42-2 margin. It now heads to the House for a floor vote. The Senate has yet to release a companion version, but lawmakers there have introduced a separate bill that would effectively block H200 sales. Under the legislation, the administration would be required to notify Congress of advanced AI chip sales before they’re approved, giving lawmakers the power to review and block export licenses to China, Russia, Iran, and other adversaries through a joint resolution. The measure calls for allowing members of House Foreign Affairs and Senate Banking committees to see the numbers of chips up for export as well as the end-users buying them. It also creates a way for so-called “trusted” AI companies to receive license exemptions when sending chips to US allies and neutral countries, an approach commended by Microsoft Corp. executive Fred Humphries, and requires the administration to submit a strategy on its policy for maintaining the US lead in the AI race. Spokespeople for Nvidia didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Congress is one step closer to gaining the authority to review artificial intelligence chip sales to China a move likely to open a rift with the Trump administration over plans to let Nvidia Corp. sell its powerful H200 processors to the world ’ s second largest economy . A House committee focused on foreign affairs approved bipartisan legislation Wednesday that calls for armssale style congressional oversight of advanced AI chip exports . The text endorsed by the panel ’ s Republicans and Democrats would outright ban sales of Nvidia ’ s Blackwell chips to China for two years codifying existing export controls into law . The bill marks a response to President Donald Trump ’ s decision last month to ease longstanding export controls on China a move aimed at spurring adoption of American AI technology in global markets but one that drew strenuous objections from national security hawks in Congress . Trump ’ s approval for Nvidia ’ s H200 sales to Chinese customers was formalized by a new rule issued last week by the Commerce Department . The panel approved the bill by a 422 margin . It now heads to the House for a floor vote . The Senate has yet to release a companion version but lawmakers there have introduced a separate bill that would effectively block H200 sales . Under the legislation the administration would be required to notify Congress of advanced AI chip sales before they ’ re approved giving lawmakers the power to review and block export licenses to China Russia Iran and other adversaries through a joint resolution . The measure calls for allowing members of House Foreign Affairs and Senate Banking committees to see the numbers of chips up for export as well as the endusers buying them . It also creates a way for socalled “ trusted ” AI companies to receive license exemptions when sending chips to US allies and neutral countries an approach commended by Microsoft Corp. executive Fred Humphries and requires the administration to submit a strategy on its policy for maintaining the US lead in the AI race . Spokespeople for Nvidia didn ’ t immediately respond to a request for comment ."

He said: \"This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all Nato Nations. \"Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland. \"Further information will be made available as discussions progress. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and various others, as needed, will be responsible for the negotiations - They will report directly to me.

      "selftext": "Hey guys, so I am trying to figure out the proper way to do a stock and bond balance. I am currently 24 and have a ROTH IRA that is at 15k and fully invested in VT. I am planning on adding bonds when I get to 40 or so. At 40 I am thinking to get to 10% bonds, then increase by 1% each ear until I am at 30% at 60. I know that is is best to have bonds in a traditional IRA and keep the ROTH 100% VT. The problem I've been thinking about is when I'm 40, lets say the ROTH is at 100k or something with me contributing the max each year. If I just start the bonds at that point in a traditional IRA, how could I get the traditional to 10K? I know you cannot transfer funds from a ROTH to traditional, and the contribution limit is around 7k shared between both of them. I was thinking maybe if I get a 401k(which I dont currently have) I could transfer that to a traditional with funds already in there. It would be nice to just immediately transfer 10% of the funds from VT to bonds, but this doesn't seem possible between a ROTH and traditional. This all seems like a headache. What is the best way to go about the bond and stock balance?",

      "selftext": "**The 30-year backstory** Japan's economy melted down in 1990 with the popping of a huge real estate and equity bubble. To restore the economy, Japan pioneered the playbook central banks now run everywhere: slash interest rates to zero, then buy massive quantities of your own government bonds. This creates artificial demand that pushes yields (aka borrowing costs) even lower. It's a bit like your left pocket owing money to your right pocket. And being able to print money to pay it back. It let Japan run up the largest debt in the world. 1.3 quadrillion yen to be exact. That's quadrillion with a Q. It also opened up an obvious trade. If you can borrow money for free, and put it in something yielding 4, 5, 6%... you've found an infinite money glitch. Japanese investors plowed into US treasury bills. This made them the largest holder of US treasuries, with $1.2 trillion. The rest went into tech stocks and anything else going up. This worked great for thirty years until COVID. Governments were forced to print money en masse, and inflation finally arrived. Japan's playbook worked when inflation was dead. But when it finally came back and prices started rising, printing money would make it worse. So Japan has had to stop printing money, and raise rates. **The $1.2 trillion dollar question** So the reason people are freaking out about Japanese bond yields being up? Because Japanese bond yields have crossed 4% for the first time in decades. For thirty years, Japanese investors had to look abroad for yield. Now they can get it at home. That $1.2 trillion in US Treasuries starts to have a reason to head back to Tokyo. All that cheap Japanese money had to go somewhere. For thirty years, it went into Treasuries, tech stocks, everything. Now imagine it leaving. And that has markets on edge. **What's next?** I don't know how this shakes out. But when Ray Dalio talks about a \"changing world order,\" this is probably part of it. One of the global market's laws of nature, endless cheap Japanese money, is coming to an end. **Note:** I wrote this as an exercise to help myself understand the situation. By no means an expert, so let me know if I missed anything obvious.",

      "selftext_processed": "The 30year backstory Japans economy melted down in 1990 with the popping of a huge real estate and equity bubble . To restore the economy Japan pioneered the playbook central banks now run everywhere slash interest rates to zero then buy massive quantities of your own government bonds . This creates artificial demand that pushes yields aka borrowing costs even lower . Its a bit like your left pocket owing money to your right pocket . And being able to print money to pay it back . It let Japan run up the largest debt in the world . 1.3 quadrillion yen to be exact . Thats quadrillion with a Q . It also opened up an obvious trade . If you can borrow money for free and put it in something yielding 4 5 6 % ... youve found an infinite money glitch . Japanese investors plowed into US treasury bills . This made them the largest holder of US treasuries with $ 1.2 trillion . The rest went into tech stocks and anything else going up . This worked great for thirty years until COVID . Governments were forced to print money en masse and inflation finally arrived . Japans playbook worked when inflation was dead . But when it finally came back and prices started rising printing money would make it worse . So Japan has had to stop printing money and raise rates . The $ 1.2 trillion dollar question So the reason people are freaking out about Japanese bond yields being up Because Japanese bond yields have crossed 4 % for the first time in decades . For thirty years Japanese investors had to look abroad for yield . Now they can get it at home . That $ 1.2 trillion in US Treasuries starts to have a reason to head back to Tokyo . All that cheap Japanese money had to go somewhere . For thirty years it went into Treasuries tech stocks everything . Now imagine it leaving . And that has markets on edge . Whats next I dont know how this shakes out . But when Ray Dalio talks about a changing world order this is probably part of it . One of the global markets laws of nature endless cheap Japanese money is coming to an end . Note I wrote this as an exercise to help myself understand the situation . By no_means an expert so let me know if I missed anything obvious ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ ]( >The European Union's legislative body on Wednesday halted work on the formal approval and implementation of the trade deal it reached last summer with President Donald Trump. >\"Given the continued and escalating threats, including tariff threats, against Greenland and Denmark, and their European allies, we have been left with no alternative but to suspend work\" on the deal, said Bernd Lange, the chairman of the European Parliament's international trade committee. >\"Until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation,\" no steps to move the deal forward would be taken, Lange said in a statement. >\"Our sovereignty and territorial integrity are at stake,\" he added in a post on X. \"Business as usual impossible.\" >The announcement came after Trump on Saturday said he would hit seven European Union countries, plus the U.K., with tariffs if they did not allow the United States to control Greenland. >The E.U. trade deal was reached in July during a visit by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Trump's golf club in Turnberry, Scotland. >The core of the deal was a cap on U.S. tariffs applied to most imports from the E.U. at just 15%. The rate was among the lowest received by any trading partner last year. >Some imports from the E.U., such as generic pharmaceuticals would have had all tariffs removed. >In exchange for the lower tariff rate, the European Union, America's largest trading partner, would have lowered tariffs on some goods it imports from the United States. This would have helped American agricultural and industrial companies sell products into the 27-country bloc. >The total trading relationship between the U.S. and E.U. was worth $1.5 trillion in goods and services annually, as of 2024. The U.S. imports more than $600 billion in goods from the bloc each year on average, while Europeans buy more than $360 billion of U.S. goods, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative. >When the so-called \"Turnberry deal\" was first announced, the European Commission hailed its potential, saying it \"restores stability and predictability.\" >But all that changed with Trump's Saturday tariff threat. >\"In politics as in business, a deal is a deal\" Von der Leyen said on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"When friends shake hands, it must mean something.\" >During his own Davos speech, Trump said that the U.S. would not use force to seize Greenland. But he did not take his threat of a 10% tariff starting Feb. 1 off the table. >Lange, the E.U. trade official, held a press conference following Trump's speech and called the president's assurances about force in Greenland \"a small positive element.\" >Nonetheless, \"It's totally clear that with this 10%-25% \\[tariffs\\] pressure, he is really getting into a new quality of relation,\" said Lange. >As long as Trump's tariff threat remains in place, \"There will be no possibility for compromise\" Lange said. >On Thursday, leaders of the 27 E.U. countries will meet to discuss their coordinated response to Trump's Greenland threats. >This may include a package of retaliatory tariffs worth nearly $110 billion, which would impact a wide range of U.S. exports, from Boeing airplanes to soybeans to Kentucky bourbon. >Another potential retaliatory measure would be to deploy the bloc's \"Anti-Coercion Instrument,\" a policy option sometimes referred to as the E.U.'s trade \"bazooka.\" >The ACI would allow the European Commission to target nearly any U.S. goods or services in Europe with a wide range of restrictions and barriers. >These could include investment restrictions, the lifting of intellectual property protections for American companies, the suspension of business licenses, and outright bans on market access to the Eurozone. >Originally proposed in 2021 to give the E.U. a powerful set of tools to counter potential Chinese economic coercion, the trade bazooka has never been deployed before. >On Wednesday, Lange said he was in favor of putting the bazooka into use.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source The European Unions legislative body on Wednesday halted work on the formal approval and implementation of the trade deal it reached last summer with President Donald Trump . Given the continued and escalating threats including tariff threats against Greenland and Denmark and their European allies we have been left with no_alternative but to suspend work on the deal said Bernd Lange the chairman of the European Parliaments international trade committee . Until the US decides to reengage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation no_steps to move the deal forward would be taken Lange said in a statement . Our sovereignty and territorial integrity are at stake he added in a post on X . Business as usual impossible . The announcement came after Trump on Saturday said he would hit seven European Union countries plus the U.K. with tariffs if they did not_allow the United States to control Greenland . The E.U . trade deal was reached in July during a visit by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Trumps golf club in Turnberry Scotland . The core of the deal was a cap on U.S. tariffs applied to most imports from the E.U . at just 15 % . The rate was among the lowest received by any trading partner last year . Some imports from the E.U . such as generic pharmaceuticals would have had all tariffs removed . In exchange for the lower tariff rate the European Union Americas largest trading partner would have lowered tariffs on some goods it imports from the United States . This would have helped American agricultural and industrial companies sell products into the 27country bloc . The total trading relationship between the U.S. and E.U . was worth $ 1.5 trillion in goods and services annually as of 2024 . The U.S. imports more than $ 600 billion in goods from the bloc each year on average while Europeans buy more than $ 360 billion of U.S. goods according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative . When the socalled Turnberry deal was first announced the European Commission hailed its potential saying it restores stability and predictability . But all that changed with Trumps Saturday tariff threat . In politics as in business a deal is a deal Von der Leyen said on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland . When friends shake hands it must mean something . During his own Davos speech Trump said that the U.S. would not_use force to seize Greenland . But he did not_take his threat of a 10 % tariff starting Feb. 1 off the table . Lange the E.U . trade official held a press conference following Trumps speech and called the presidents assurances about force in Greenland a small positive element . Nonetheless Its totally clear that with this 10 % 25 % tariffs pressure he is really getting into a new quality of relation said Lange . As long as Trumps tariff threat remains in place There will be no_possibility for compromise Lange said . On Thursday leaders of the 27 E.U . countries will meet to discuss their coordinated response to Trumps Greenland threats . This may include a package of retaliatory tariffs worth nearly $ 110 billion which would impact a wide range of U.S. exports from Boeing airplanes to soybeans to Kentucky bourbon . Another potential retaliatory measure would be to deploy the blocs AntiCoercion Instrument a policy option sometimes referred to as the E.U.s trade bazooka . The ACI would allow the European Commission to target nearly any U.S. goods or services in Europe with a wide range of restrictions and barriers . These could include investment restrictions the lifting of intellectual property protections for American companies the suspension of business licenses and outright bans on market access to the Eurozone . Originally proposed in 2021 to give the E.U . a powerful set of tools to counter potential Chinese economic coercion the trade bazooka has never_been deployed before . On Wednesday Lange said he was in favor of putting the bazooka into use ."

      "title": "European lawmakers suspend U.S. trade deal amid Greenland tariff tensions",
      "selftext": "European lawmakers on Wednesday suspended the approval of the trade deal that the EU and U.S. agreed in July. In a statement on Wednesday, European Parliament member Bernd Lange, and INTA chair on EU-US trade relations, said the recent plans by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs of between 10% to 25% on European nations go against the terms of the trade pact. Referring to Trump’s address at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Lange said: “I guess he didn’t revise his position. He wants to have Greenland as part of the United States as quick as possible.” In his speech, the president called for “immediate negotiations” on the acquisition of the Arctic territory. Trump ruled out the use of military force in his speech, a commitment Lange described as a “small positive element.” However, Lange said the proposed 10% to 25% tariffs remain on the table, adding that, until the threat of them is over, “there will be no possibility of compromise.” “We will hold on the procedure... until there is clarity regarding Greenland and the threats,” he said. Lange said Trump is “using tariffs as an instrument of political pressure” as a way to buy Greenland, and described the move as “an attack against the economic and territorial sovereignty of the European Union.” Politics aside, this is good for Equities market all around. Expect markets to be ticking higher until end of earnings season.",

      "selftext": "I keep hearing people compare Nvidia to Cisco Systems circa 1999. Bulls say Nvidia is different. Bears say it's the dot-com bubble all over again. I own 190 shares and here's my honest assessment. First, the bull case. Nvidia's real moat isn't just GPUs. It's CUDA. 4.5M developers vs 1.8M in 2020. That's an ecosystem Cisco never had. Cisco laid 'dark fiber', infrastructure nobody used. Nvidia's GPUs are powering real products generating real revenue. There are already 10 AI products over $1B ARR, 50 over $100M. Enterprise AI spending is $37B in 2025, up from $11.5B in 2024. That's 3x growth. The demand is real, not hypothetical as it was for Cisco. But the bear case is legitimate. At 50x P/E, Nvidia is priced for perfection. If hyperscaler capex peaks or competition emerges, the stock has a long way to fall. Google's TPU, Amazon's Trainium, Microsoft's Maia - all custom chips designed to reduce Nvidia dependence. If any succeed at scale, Nvidia's moat gets tested (although these are arguably a long way off). The wildcard is export controls. As a lawyer and former compliance officer at a big bank, I see something most overlook - the US govt plans to take 25% of Nvidia's China chip sales. They've literally crowned Nvidia as the winner. This creates a regulatory moat. The government has skin in the game. But it's also a risk because China has to play along (which they soon likely will) and policy could change overnight. But here's the valuation reality - Nvidia needs \\~$198B earnings by 2028 to justify current prices. In my newsletter, I break down various scenarios: Bull case (25%): doubles from here. Base case (50%): down \\~15%. Bear case (25%): down \\~65%.",

      "selftext_processed": "I keep hearing people compare Nvidia to Cisco Systems circa 1999 . Bulls say Nvidia is different . Bears say its the dotcom bubble all over again . I own 190 shares and heres my honest assessment . First the bull case . Nvidias real moat isnt just GPUs . Its CUDA . 4.5M developers vs 1.8M in 2020 . Thats an ecosystem Cisco never_had . Cisco laid dark fiber infrastructure nobody_used . Nvidias GPUs are powering real products generating real revenue . There are already 10 AI products over $ 1B ARR 50 over $ 100M . Enterprise AI spending is $ 37B in 2025 up from $ 11.5B in 2024 . Thats 3x growth . The demand is real not_hypothetical as it was for Cisco . But the bear case is legitimate . At 50x PE Nvidia is priced for perfection . If hyperscaler capex peaks or competition emerges the stock has a long way to fall . Googles TPU Amazons Trainium Microsofts Maia all custom chips designed to reduce Nvidia dependence . If any succeed at scale Nvidias moat gets tested although these are arguably a long way off . The wildcard is export controls . As a lawyer and former compliance officer at a big bank I see something most overlook the US govt plans to take 25 % of Nvidias China chip sales . Theyve literally crowned Nvidia as the winner . This creates a regulatory moat . The government has skin in the game . But its also a risk because China has to play along which they soon likely will and policy could change overnight . But heres the valuation reality Nvidia needs $ 198B earnings by 2028 to justify current prices . In my newsletter I break down various scenarios Bull case 25 % doubles from here . Base case 50 % down 15 % . Bear case 25 % down 65 % ."

      "selftext": "So I've been watching Atlassian (**$TEAM**) stock for a while now and have personally decided to pull the trigger. If you don't know Atlassian, they're a software company who create productivity software and are massively used in the tech industry and in most companies that use Agile processes. Put it this way, I work in tech and the majority of companies I have worked in use Atlassian products, namely Confluence, Jira, Service desk and such. Also before anyone mentions it, the profitability of Atlassian is hidden because of SBC but this hasn't been a problem for the market in the past 5+ years. Plus they invest 30% in R&D! It has pulled back over 50% in the past year from its 52 week high of $326. The main reasoning for this is the insider selling, but this is just 10b5-1 plans which is expected... To counter this they currently have a $2.5b share buy back issued and I suspect they'll have more to come at these low prices. The other main reason is the AI fear. Why I think the stock will rise a lot from here: * AI replacing engineers is overhyped, so imo we won't be seeing less sales coming from this. If anything I think over the long term it will increase as more software products are desired and a bunch of mess from AI has to be cleaned up by real developers * AI being able to produce a product like Jira is even more overhyped/crazy. Its great for boilerplate code and basic apps if you know what you're doing, but thinking you can create a scalable, secure, production ready application set like what Atlassian has with all of the regulatory compliance and such built in is crazy... * Deeply embedded in many companies - as I mentioned whether you like Confluence/Jira or not it is used in so many companies and won't be going anywhere * The move away from self hosted to cloud based subscriptions is going to create even more revenue growth as the adoption continues * Rovo their AI tool that will be integrated in the Atlassian eco system will add even more value once further adoption occurs * Recent acquisitions will add further revenue Summary: TEAM often trades at massive multiples (25x-40x Sales). Today, trading around **4.7x** **EV/Sales** with a deeply entrenched moat embedded within thousands of large companies, 20%+ growth, and massive Free Cash Flow (FCF) margins. Currently sitting at a multi year support level ready for its next explosive recovery and new all time high in the next 6-24 months. Let me know what you think! Is the overhyped AI fear SaaS sell-off over?",

      "selftext_processed": "So Ive been watching Atlassian $ TEAM stock for a while now and have personally decided to pull the trigger . If you dont know Atlassian theyre a software company who create productivity software and are massively used in the tech industry and in most companies that use Agile processes . Put it this way I work in tech and the majority of companies I have worked in use Atlassian products namely Confluence Jira Service desk and such . Also before anyone mentions it the profitability of Atlassian is hidden because of SBC but this hasnt been a problem for the market in the past 5 years . Plus they invest 30 % in RD It has pulled back over 50 % in the past year from its 52 week high of $ 326 . The main reasoning for this is the insider selling but this is just 10b51 plans which is expected ... To counter this they currently have a $ 2.5b share buy back issued and I suspect theyll have more to come at these low prices . The other main reason is the AI fear . Why I think the stock will rise a lot from here AI replacing engineers is overhyped so imo we wont be seeing less sales coming from this . If anything I think over the long term it will increase as more software products are desired and a bunch of mess from AI has to be cleaned up by real developers AI being able to produce a product like Jira is even more overhypedcrazy . Its great for boilerplate code and basic apps if you know what youre doing but thinking you can create a scalable secure production ready application set like what Atlassian has with all of the regulatory compliance and such built in is crazy ... Deeply embedded in many companies as I mentioned whether you like ConfluenceJira or not_it is used in so many companies and wont be going anywhere The move away from self hosted to cloud based subscriptions is going to create even more revenue growth as the adoption continues Rovo their AI tool that will be integrated in the Atlassian eco system will add even more value once further adoption occurs Recent acquisitions will add further revenue Summary TEAM often trades at massive multiples 25x40x Sales . Today trading around 4.7x EVSales with a deeply entrenched moat embedded within thousands of large companies 20 % growth and massive Free Cash Flow FCF margins . Currently sitting at a multi year support level ready for its next explosive recovery and new all time high in the next 624 months . Let me know what you think Is the overhyped AI fear SaaS selloff over"

      "selftext": "President Trump said the U.S. wouldn't use force to acquire Greenland and was seeking negotiations on the acquisition of the territory, repeating his claim that only the U.S. is capable of defending it. In an address in Davos, Switzerland, he said the reason the U.S. needs to take control of Greenland is purely for security and has nothing to do with access to minerals. He opened his speech by saying Europe wasn't heading in the right direction, adding that “certain places in Europe are not recognizable” and criticizing the region's approach to energy. He also touted the successes of the U.S. economy, saying it was in the midst of the “most dramatic economic turnaround in history.” The speech came on the back of raised tensions between the U.S. and Europe over the president's designs on Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, with terse exchanges between officials at the Swiss gathering. Stock futures edged higher, while gold kept rallying. It’s going to be a good year. Market like stability and less so with uncertainty. DCA is the name of the game.",

In an address in Davos Switzerland he said the reason the U.S. needs to take control of Greenland is purely for security and has nothing_to do with access to minerals . He opened his speech by saying Europe wasnt heading in the right direction adding that “ certain places in Europe are not_recognizable ” and criticizing the regions approach to energy . He also touted the successes of the U.S. economy saying it was in the midst of the “ most dramatic economic turnaround in history. ” The speech came on the back of raised tensions between the U.S. and Europe over the presidents designs on Greenland a semiautonomous territory of Denmark with terse exchanges between officials at the Swiss gathering . Stock futures edged higher while gold kept rallying . It ’ s going to be a good year . Market like stability and less so with uncertainty . DCA is the name of the game ."

      "selftext": "Many of you know this but in the last century, money changed three times: 1. 1933-1934 During the Great Depression, the US government banned the ownership of gold. Citizens were required by law to turn in their gold for dollars at $20.67 per ounce. Shortly after people turned in their gold, the US government revalued gold at 35$ per ounce, effectively devaluing the dollar overnight. 2. 1944-1971 After World War II, a new system was created: the Bretton Woods system. The US dollar became the world's reserve currency, convertible to gold at $35 per ounce for foreign governments & central banks. Most global trade and reserves were held in dollars, while gold was stored in US government vaults. This system worked until foreign claims on US gold exceeded available reserves. 3. 1971 The US ended gold convertibility entirely. Money was backed by trust, institutions and policy. Under the gold standard and Bretton Woods, the Federal Reserve’s ability to expand the money supply was constrained by gold convertibility. After Bretton Woods ended in 1971, those constraints disappeared, giving the Fed far greater discretion to create liquidity Most of the US gold reserve (8 metric tons of gold) was accumulated before 1971, first through domestic gold confiscation in the 1930s and later through foreign gold inflows under the Bretton Woods system as dollars were exchanged for gold. The same \\~8,000 tons of US gold were valued at \\~$5B in 1933, \\~$9B after the 1934 revaluation, and would be worth over $1.25T today at market prices. This lead to assets going up in value drastically. \\- Today gold is valued at $4,880 per ounce. That means the dollar has lost it's value 233 times to gold since the 1930s. \\- Equities performed very well, despite early volatility. The S&P 500 rose from 90 in the early 1970s to almost hitting 7,000 recently (trading around 6,800 as I am writing this). \\- Real Estate compounded strongly. The Average Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States (ASPUS - a statistic from FRED) went from $19,300 in 1963 to $512,800 in Q2 of 2025. \\- Silver oscillated between monetary and industrial roles, rising from roughly $1.50/oz in the early 1970s to \\~$95/oz today. \\- Oil repriced meaningfully going from 3$ per barrel in the early 70s to \\~60$ per barrel. Early stock markets were far more volatile than today. During the Great Depression equities fell nearly 90%. Over time, owning productive businesses proved resilient not because volatility disappeared, but because companies could adapt and reprice under new monetary rules. Gold followed a similar path, from money to restricted asset, to restricted reserve and finally a long-term hedge against currency debasement. Today, digital assets exist alongside the traditional assets mentioned above and they appear to be at an earlier stage of that same maturation process. Bitcoin introduced a globally transferable asset with a hard capped supply. Whether this asset ultimately becomes a long term store of value, settlement infrastructure or simply another category of risk asset is still uncertain. How do you think monetary policy will evolve? Do you think digital assets have a part in this evolution?",

      "selftext_processed": "Many of you know this but in the last century money changed three times 1 . 19331934 During the Great Depression the US government banned the ownership of gold . Citizens were required by law to turn in their gold for dollars at $ 20.67 per ounce . Shortly after people turned in their gold the US government revalued gold at 35 $ per ounce effectively devaluing the dollar overnight . 2 . 19441971 After World War II a new system was created the Bretton Woods system . The US dollar became the worlds reserve currency convertible to gold at $ 35 per ounce for foreign governments central banks . Most global trade and reserves were held in dollars while gold was stored in US government vaults . This system worked until foreign claims on US gold exceeded available reserves . 3 . 1971 The US ended gold convertibility entirely . Money was backed by trust institutions and policy . Under the gold standard and Bretton Woods the Federal Reserve ’ s ability to expand the money supply was constrained by gold convertibility . After Bretton Woods ended in 1971 those constraints disappeared giving the Fed far greater discretion to create liquidity Most of the US gold reserve 8 metric tons of gold was accumulated before 1971 first through domestic gold confiscation in the 1930s and later through foreign gold inflows under the Bretton Woods system as dollars were exchanged for gold . The same 8000 tons of US gold were valued at $ 5B in 1933 $ 9B after the 1934 revaluation and would be worth over $ 1.25T today at market prices . This lead to assets going up in value drastically . Today gold is valued at $ 4880 per ounce . That means the dollar has lost its value 233 times to gold since the 1930s . Equities performed very well despite early volatility . The SP 500 rose from 90 in the early 1970s to almost hitting 7000 recently trading around 6800 as I am writing this . Real Estate compounded strongly . The Average Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States ASPUS a statistic from FRED went from $ 19300 in 1963 to $ 512800 in Q2 of 2025 . Silver oscillated between monetary and industrial roles rising from roughly $ 1.50oz in the early 1970s to $ 95oz today . Oil repriced meaningfully going from 3 $ per barrel in the early 70s to 60 $ per barrel . Early stock markets were far more volatile than today . During the Great Depression equities fell nearly 90 % . Over time owning productive businesses proved resilient not_because volatility disappeared but because companies could adapt and reprice under new monetary rules . Gold followed a similar path from money to restricted asset to restricted reserve and finally a longterm hedge against currency debasement . Today digital assets exist alongside the traditional assets mentioned above and they appear to be at an earlier stage of that same maturation process . Bitcoin introduced a globally transferable asset with a hard capped supply . Whether this asset ultimately becomes a long term store of value settlement infrastructure or simply another category of risk asset is still uncertain . How do you think monetary policy will evolve Do you think digital assets have a part in this evolution"

      "selftext": "Looking at the cross-asset snapshot (SPY/QQQ down \\~2%, ARKK down more, BTC/ETH weak, long yields still elevated, and gold up hard), the message doesn’t feel like a clean “growth scare” or a clean “inflation scare.” It reads more like: the constraint is financing, and the adjustment is getting pushed into the places that can move fastest (risk premia, multiples, labor). A useful way to frame it is: stop asking “soft landing or recession?” and ask “where does the system externalize adjustment: prices, profits, or people?” In a slowdown with high fixed costs and still-meaningful financing rates, companies tend to defend mrgns first. This often means labor becomes the shock absorber (hiring slows, layoffs, wage pressure), while capex gets more selective, concentrated into productivity tech and “bottleneck control, not broad expansion. The non-obvious link here is the long end. When long yields stay firm while equities sell off, that’s not the market offering relief. It’s tightening the hurdle rate. That’s also why gold ripping while the long end doesn’t fall is interesting: it can be less “inflation hedge” and more “trust hedge/regime hedge.” This is the kind of tape where liquidity is selective, some things find bids, a lot of things don’t. **Quick asset paths (just how I’d map scenarios):** Gold: can keep working if stress is about confidence/term premium, even if stocks are weak. If yields actually roll over cleanly, gold can go sideways while risk re-rates. BTC: tends to trade like liquidity sensitivity + reflexivity. If the funding constraint persists, BTC can stay heavy; if policy/liquidity engineering shows up, it can move violently. ETH: usually higher beta than BTC, often needs “easy conditions” more. Watch ETH/BTC for whether liquidty is broadening. Tech companies like AMD/NVDA: caught between AI capex resilience and rate sensitivity (duration). If yields stabilize/fall, multiples can re-rate fast; if term premium stays sticky, “good company, bad tape” can persist. If this is the right read, “solutions” probably don’t look like a simple Fed cut story. More likely it’s a mix of liquidity plumbing, debt management, and,or implicit yield management when volatility becomes unacceptable. The trade-off is you don’t get a stable “everything rallies” regime, you get dispersion and capital concentrating in whoever can fund themselves cheaply and control bottlenecks.",

A useful way to frame it is stop asking “ soft landing or recession ” and ask “ where does the system externalize adjustment prices profits or people ” In a slowdown with high fixed costs and stillmeaningful financing rates companies tend to defend mrgns first . This often means labor becomes the shock absorber hiring slows layoffs wage pressure while capex gets more selective concentrated into productivity tech and “ bottleneck control not_broad expansion . The nonobvious link here is the long end . When long yields stay firm while equities sell off that ’ s not_the market offering relief . It ’ s tightening the hurdle rate . That ’ s also why gold ripping while the long end doesn ’ t fall is interesting it can be less “ inflation hedge ” and more “ trust hedgeregime hedge. ” This is the kind of tape where liquidity is selective some things find bids a lot of things don ’ t . Quick asset paths just how I ’ d map scenarios Gold can keep working if stress is about confidenceterm premium even if stocks are weak . If yields actually roll over cleanly gold can go sideways while risk rerates . BTC tends to trade like liquidity sensitivity reflexivity . If the funding constraint persists BTC can stay heavy if policyliquidity engineering shows up it can move violently . ETH usually higher beta than BTC often needs “ easy conditions ” more . Watch ETHBTC for whether liquidty is broadening . Tech companies like AMDNVDA caught between AI capex resilience and rate sensitivity duration . If yields stabilizefall multiples can rerate fast if term premium stays sticky “ good company bad tape ” can persist . If this is the right read “ solutions ” probably don ’ t look like a simple Fed cut story . More likely it ’ s a mix of liquidity plumbing debt management andor implicit yield management when volatility becomes unacceptable . The tradeoff is you don ’ t get a stable “ everything rallies ” regime you get dispersion and capital concentrating in whoever can fund themselves cheaply and control bottlenecks ."

Following recent news, and recent Trump administraion 'tendencies', I dont have a feeling of investing in the US anymore. The US find and have showed that they have unmatched power, they can do what they want. But without the rest of the world, being isolated, that power will be no more than just a bluff. I find it is the time to sell all my US stocks, leave the damn market, put that money into Europe, where there are still lots of great companies. I would like to hear opinions from Americans and Europeans as well. Edit: thank you guys for sharing the thoughts. Somebody judged that my thought is childish and emotional. Well, yes and no. It is not only that I am unhappy or mad at Trump and his fellows, it is more about showing to the US the resistance once they have stepped too far. Me alone is just a grain of sand, but with the many of Europeans or else where, it will not be an insignificant negative impact on the US market (which Trump cares very much). So hopefully, he realizes a borderline. But well, I am cashing out quite some portion of the US part, not completely yet. Hope to see a better US, with more respect from both directions.",

Following recent news and recent Trump administraion tendencies I dont have a feeling of investing in the US anymore . The US find and have showed that they have unmatched power they can do what they want . But without the rest of the world being isolated that power will be no_more than just a bluff . I find it is the time to sell all my US stocks leave the damn market put that money into Europe where there are still lots of great companies . I would like to hear opinions from Americans and Europeans as well . Edit thank you guys for sharing the thoughts . Somebody judged that my thought is childish and emotional . Well yes and no_It is not_only that I am unhappy or mad at Trump and his fellows it is more about showing to the US the resistance once they have stepped too far . Me alone is just a grain of sand but with the many of Europeans or else where it will not_be an insignificant negative impact on the US market which Trump cares very much . So hopefully he realizes a borderline . But well I am cashing out quite some portion of the US part not_completely yet . Hope to see a better US with more respect from both directions ."

This year, some people have asked a great question: Why is the Trump administration going to Davos at all? Why show up and participate when we’ve been so clear that the old globalist line of thinking has been a disaster for America? >The answer is simple: we’re not going to Davos to uphold the status quo. We’re going to confront it head-on. >For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world. Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary, borders were not, and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good. That approach failed the US, crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well. It destroyed industries, weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind. ... >We are here at Davos to make one thing crystal clear: With President Trump, capitalism has a new sheriff in town. For decades, countries were told there was only one acceptable model. They were forced to depend on global supply chains and foolishly trust that global institutions would have their backs. That model put America dead last, and left countless others weaker as well. There's other crazy stuff in there like taking credit for the uptick in overseas stock markets. No mention of the Greenland/NATO stuff. EDIT: [FT now reporting]( that Lutnick got heckled and jeered at a Davos dinner last night, with some attendees walking out. It's going to be a messy day.",

      "selftext_processed": "Another delusional and unhinged oped in the FT from the Trump admin this time from Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick Every year in January leaders gather in Davos Switzerland for the World Economic Forum to discuss the global economy . This year some people have asked a great question Why is the Trump administration going to Davos at all Why show up and participate when we ’ ve been so clear that the old globalist line of thinking has been a disaster for America The answer is simple we ’ re not_going to Davos to uphold the status quo . We ’ re going to confront it headon . For far too long the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America ’ s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world . Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary borders were not_and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good . That approach failed the US crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well . It destroyed industries weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind . ... We are here at Davos to make one thing crystal clear With President Trump capitalism has a new sheriff in town . For decades countries were told there was only one acceptable model . They were forced to depend on global supply chains and foolishly trust that global institutions would have their backs . That model put America dead last and left countless others weaker as well . Theres other crazy stuff in there like taking credit for the uptick in overseas stock markets . No_mention of the GreenlandNATO stuff . EDIT FT now reporting that Lutnick got heckled and jeered at a Davos dinner last night with some attendees walking out . Its going to be a messy day ."

      "title": "Why Are People So Negative on HIMS? “No Moat” Argument Feels Overblown",
      "selftext": "I’ve been seeing a lot of bearish takes on HIMS lately, and the most common criticism seems to be that the company has no moat and will get crushed by competition. I’m genuinely trying to understand this take because it feels overly simplistic. Yes, telehealth is competitive. Yes, a lot of companies can sell ED meds, hair loss treatments, etc. But HIMS isn’t just standing still or doing the bare minimum. They’re rolling out at-home lab testing, expanding into menopause / perimenopause care, and even getting into peptides. Those are not trivial add-ons. I honestly haven’t seen many competitors offering at-home labs at scale as part of a broader subscription health platform. To me, the moat argument misses a few things: Ecosystem > single product. Someone who does labs + ongoing treatment + subscriptions is way stickier than someone buying generic meds once. Menopause care is massively underserved and growing fast. Peptides and personalized health feel like early innings, not late-stage commoditized stuff. Brand matters more than people admit in healthcare. I get the concerns around: Marketing spend Margins Competition from Ro, Amazon, traditional healthcare, etc. But saying “no moat” feels lazy. Not every moat is patents or exclusive tech — sometimes it’s distribution, trust, brand, and integration. So I’m genuinely curious: Is the negativity mostly about valuation and past stock performance? Do people just lump HIMS in with every other telehealth company? Or is there something structurally broken here that I’m missing? Not trying to pump — just trying to understand why sentiment is so bad when the company seems to be expanding into harder, more defensible areas, not easier ones. Would love to hear real bear cases beyond “competition bad.”",

According to a report by tradebrains these are the reasons for the Metal Stocks Rally • Copper prices at record high: Copper prices jumped to an all-time high of $13,253.50 per tonne on the LME due to fears of supply shortages and rising uncertainty in Venezuela, a key region for natural resources. • Critical minerals theme: According to market experts, metals like copper are gaining importance as countries focus on securing critical minerals and strengthening supply chains in the changing global order. • Impact of US Fed rate cut: The December US Federal Reserve rate cut supported metal prices by improving liquidity and encouraging investment in commodities. • Supply-side concerns: Ongoing worries about tight global supply and the possibility of additional sector-specific tariffs have added to positive sentiment. • Aluminium price rise: Aluminium prices also moved higher, driven by a tighter supply outlook and expectations of strong long-term demand across industries such as infrastructure and energy. In view of these factors, stocks like Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc, Hindustan Copper, Hindalco are witnessing sharp buying interest. Which is your fav stock at the moment?",

Most of it was received from my parents and grandparents, collected over time as gifts on special occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries. My collection includes full silver cutlery sets (forks, knives, spoons) as well as jewelry, including bracelets, necklaces, rings, earrings, and chains. The silver, in its physical form, has a total combined weight of approximately 10 kilograms (≈320 troy ounces). If the market price of silver reaches $100 per ounce, one might think the total value would be $100 × 320 = $32,000. Are there ways to get closer to the full market (spot) price) for my silver?",

Most of it was received from my parents and grandparents collected over time as gifts on special occasions such as birthdays weddings and anniversaries . My collection includes full silver cutlery sets forks knives spoons as well as jewelry including bracelets necklaces rings earrings and chains . The silver in its physical form has a total combined weight of approximately 10 kilograms ≈320 troy ounces . If the market price of silver reaches $ 100 per ounce one might think the total value would be $ 100 × 320 $ 32000 . Are there ways to get closer to the full market spot price for my silver"

      "selftext": "I want this knowledgeable community to poke holes in my logic. I have stocks that have significant unrealized gains, and I have decent amount of cash. If I invest all the cash in VOO right now (close to ATH) and when market goes down, I sell VOO and buy VTI to maintain same exposure while harvesting tax losses against the significant realized gains *(yes, I will sell the stock with gains but won't have to pay any or as much tax)*. With this approach, I win if market goes up (VOO investment increases) and I win if market goes down (tax benefit). Here's an example - let's say I invested $2k in individual stocks and have $10k unrealized gain in those individual stocks (i.e. total $12k). Additionally, I have $20k cash I invest in VOO and if this $20k becomes $15k, I sell $15k VOO to get $15k VTI and $5k in TLH. Now when I sell the individual stocks, I get $12k and need to pay tax on $5k ($10k realized gain - $5k TLH). As a result, I scan invest $12k cash in individual stocks. What am I missing?",

He's still buying. His only exit is a full takeover which he always aims for in the past 2. **BlackRock's 6M Share Position** — This isn't a passive index fund holding and rumoured to be Evy Hambro UK team. BlackRock actively chose to hold 7.4% of a junior miner exploration on a conviction fund/client account. 3. **Tribeca (7.9%)** — Australian hedge fund specializing in natural resources. They're long-term holders, not day traders. 4. **81.7% Institutional** — Only \\~18% of shares are held by retail. When institutions own this much and none are selling, there's no supply. **The Price Dynamics:** |Factor|Effect| |:-|:-| |Low float (\\~30M shares)|Small buying pressure = big price moves (what we're seeing)| |Sprott adding, not selling|Largest holder is a buyer| |No short-term flippers|Patient, thesis-driven holders| **Why the Stock Doesn't Sell Off:** When a stock rises 13x (from $3.50 to $45), you normally see profit-taking. Not here. Why? * **Sprott's cost basis is \\~$5/share** — He's up 9x and still buying at $33. No exit pressure. * **Institutions bought for the takeover** — They're not selling before the a major is forced to buy # Part 6: The Risks |Risk|Mitigation| |:-|:-| |MRE disappoints|Eric's buying pattern suggests otherwise| |Metallurgical issues|Nov 2025 study showed 93% Ag recovery + potential roasting feasibility| |Commodity price drop|Silver has structural deficit (5 years)| |Execution risk|Diane has track record (built Romarco)| |Dilution|Higher stock = less dilution needed| # Part 7: Price Targets |Scenario|Share Price|Multiple from $45| |:-|:-|:-| |MRE Disappointment|$30-35|\\-20% to -30%| |MRE Meets Expectations|$70-90|1.5-2x| |MRE Beats Expectations|$100-130|2-3x| |Takeout (2026-2027)|$130-175|3-4x| # Positions \\-11k in shares, 50 in Feb 25$ calls, 45 in May 30$ calls Up: \\~+300k USD (Positions in SGD) [SGD - USD - SGD](",

His only exit is a full takeover which he always aims for in the past 2 . BlackRocks 6M Share Position — This isnt a passive index fund holding and rumoured to be Evy Hambro UK team . BlackRock actively chose to hold 7.4 % of a junior miner exploration on a conviction fundclient account . 3 . Tribeca 7.9 % — Australian hedge fund specializing in natural resources . Theyre longterm holders not_day traders . 4 . 81.7 % Institutional — Only 18 % of shares are held by retail . When institutions own this much and none are selling theres no_supply .

Not_here . Why Sprotts cost basis is $ 5share — Hes up 9x and still buying at $ 33 . No_exit pressure .

      "selftext": "I know most people on this subreddit are American and will continue to buy and hold US stocks no matter what. But I live outside the US and am not a US citizen. I'm in my late 20s and have been investing quite heavily in the stock market for the past 5 years. Around half of my portfolio is VOO, and the other half is made up of individual stocks, most of which are American companies like Nvidia, Google and AMD. I also own non-US stocks like BABA, BYD, LULU and a couple others, but those are a relatively small portion of my portfolio atm. I've made some decent returns, but lately, with all the crazy political stuff happening in the US, I don't really have confidence that America is a safe country to invest in anymore (please keep in mind that I'm not American so I have nothing tying me to the US). I think America is speedrunning its own collapse and doing everything it can to destroy decades worth of alliances and soft power. At any moment, Trump could decide to invade Greenland and all my US shares would freefall overnight, with no guarantee on how long it would take to recover. Even from a moral perspective, not even looking at profits, it doesn't feel right investing in US companies when the US is doing so much harm globally at the moment. All this is leading me to seriously considering selling all my US stocks and reallocating them towards either individual non-US stocks, or just investing in an ETF like VXUS. Would this be a smart decision given the fact that I'm not American and am more pessimistic than optimistic about the future of the US's role on the world stage? If not, what else can I do to minimize my risk as a foreign investor?",

On December 1st, I moved apartments because my side and upstairs neighbors would alternate blasting music in the middle of the night. The leasing office and security did Jack shit. I was a pussy and didn't call the cops. So I just moved. Well here's the problem, in the beginning of January, someone moved into the upstairs unit in my new place, and is stomping and jumping on the floor. I tried talking to them, but that caused them to stomp even harder and jump. Ok, not a problem, I can deal with this. except, now they do it in the middle of the night. I don't think they have a job, because I hear this at 1am and 9am alike. I spoke with the leasing office, and get this, the ceilings on the 1st floor units are thinner. when first I moved in, they phrased it as \"The first floor units have extra tall ceilings!\" 😭 Anyway, if AXTI is more than $25 on Feb 20th, then the 18.6k in premium would more than cover breaking my current lease, moving into a new apartment complex (ON THE TOP FLOOR THIS TIME), a new phone for my mom, and the Valve Steam frame for my homie who helped me though all this. oh and taxes of course. You might think this is stupid, and yes, it is, but I've been spiraling these past 6 months. The lack of sleep and constant headache in my old apartment did a number on my mental health. Then, management at my job was going to layoff my entire department, but turns out the new company that was to replace us, didn't have product knowledge. So, a few coworkers and I escaped the layoffs for now. And now, this new apartment upstairs neighbor situation is draining me. I was 170lb in September, I'm now 155lb from all this stress.",

I've been researching Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund it's up 33.72% Calendar YTD 2025 and International Equity Index Fund up 31.83 Calendar YTD 2025. I would like to rebalance my portfolio. I was thinking of rebalancing so that EM at 5% and International Equity Index Fund at 5% as well. Is this a good/bad idea? I would appreciate any insight. I started investing in my late 30s and I'm ok with high risk. I'm aware that for several years prior to the last year or two EM wasn't doing as well and I will be watching that more closely as well. For my personal ROTH IRA my investments are FSKAX 92.09% and FZILX 7.91% of my portfolio. I'm not sure if there is much overlap between all my investments in general. For reference, I'm 44 and plan on working until maybe 67-70 yrs old.",

      "selftext": "REPOST my fault Netflix is an absolute steal right now. NFLX is currently down 30+% over the last 3 months, and is currently looking to be down another 5% after the long weekend. NFLX has long been a consistent hold for investors that don’t look at this sub for its consistent growth throughout the years, but this year and coming NFLX could very well have EXPLOSIVE growth. First things first, NFLX is a very well ran and consistently growing company, with share price still going down right now despite surpassing expectations in their recent report. I don’t need to go into specifics about how good Netflix as a company is. I just want to talk the politics. The big money maker? WBS The deal is happening. It’s very clear the deal is happening. WBS wants it, NFLX wants it, the only thing potentially stopping it is Trump, which I don’t see happening. Once this deal goes through, Netflix will have the monopoly. While every other entertainment company (YouTube, Insta, FB, TikTok, etc.) focus on short form entertainment. The movie industry will essentially be entirely owned by Netflix, going all the way to production, not just rights to stream the movie. Netflix is just going to get bigger, and before this deal goes through is the absolute best price for NFLX shares you will ever see again. Depending on when the deal goes through, I could potentially see NFLX rising 50% this year alone, and could see NFLX reaching 200 within 3 years. I’m putting most of my portfolio into Netflix, keeping in MU until 400, and another decent amount in UUUU and POET Note: Netflix is a pretty volatile stock short term. Stranger things finale sucked ass = Lower Stock. I could potentially see it going as low as 75, but over the next year-2 NFLX will see explosive growth. Thoughts?",

      "selftext_processed": "REPOST my fault Netflix is an absolute steal right now . NFLX is currently down 30 % over the last 3 months and is currently looking to be down another 5 % after the long weekend . NFLX has long been a consistent hold for investors that don ’ t look at this sub for its consistent growth throughout the years but this year and coming NFLX could very well have EXPLOSIVE growth . First things first NFLX is a very well ran and consistently growing company with share price still going down right now despite surpassing expectations in their recent report . I don ’ t need to go into specifics about how good Netflix as a company is . I just want to talk the politics . The big money maker WBS The deal is happening . It ’ s very clear the deal is happening . WBS wants it NFLX wants it the only thing potentially stopping it is Trump which I don ’ t see happening . Once this deal goes through Netflix will have the monopoly . While every other entertainment company YouTube Insta FB TikTok etc . focus on short form entertainment . The movie industry will essentially be entirely owned by Netflix going all the way to production not_just rights to stream the movie . Netflix is just going to get bigger and before this deal goes through is the absolute best price for NFLX shares you will ever see again . Depending on when the deal goes through I could potentially see NFLX rising 50 % this year alone and could see NFLX reaching 200 within 3 years . I ’ m putting most of my portfolio into Netflix keeping in MU until 400 and another decent amount in UUUU and POET Note Netflix is a pretty volatile stock short term . Stranger things finale sucked ass Lower Stock . I could potentially see it going as low as 75 but over the next year2 NFLX will see explosive growth . Thoughts"

Teams are remote devs, designers, PMs all in the same file at the same time and that alone breaks the old Adobe model. Adobe is still basically selling fancy single player software with files you pass around The real threat is that Figma becomes the default layer where product decisions happen not just pixels. Once you start design there you never really need to leave and new designers learn Figma first not Photoshop or Illustrator. That pipeline shift matters way more than people think Adobe has distribution and legacy sure but that can flip into a liability fast. Enterprises move slow individuals dont and Figma already owns the individual mindshare. By the time Adobe ships a real cloud native answer Figma will already be the system of record.. 85% gross margin with revenue growing at 38%; P/S 14; No debt, liquidity fine... I like the stock",

Teams are remote devs designers PMs all in the same file at the same time and that alone breaks the old Adobe model . Adobe is still basically selling fancy single player software with files you pass around The real threat is that Figma becomes the default layer where product decisions happen not_just pixels . Once you start design there you never_really need to leave and new designers learn Figma first not_Photoshop or Illustrator . That pipeline shift matters way more than people think Adobe has distribution and legacy sure but that can flip into a liability fast . Enterprises move slow individuals dont and Figma already owns the individual mindshare . By the time Adobe ships a real cloud native answer Figma will already be the system of record .. 85 % gross margin with revenue growing at 38 % PS 14 No_debt liquidity fine ... I like the stock"

I'm *thinking* it should be fine, since I can't see the advantage in micromanaging lots for tax efficiency when my cap gains taxes are going to be almost zero (for now and the foreseeable future, I'm a very low spender). Searching around I read a lot of comments that weren't in favor of Average Cost, but it seemed like the context was higher-spending individuals concerned about tax efficiency. But I still thought I'd ask for a sanity check on whether I'm missing some major problems. Thanks.",

Is there any reason I should be concerned that I went with Average Cost when I did my first ever stock sale Im thinking it should be fine since I cant see the advantage in micromanaging lots for tax efficiency when my cap gains taxes are going to be almost zero for now and the foreseeable future Im a very low spender . Searching around I read a lot of comments that werent in favor of Average Cost but it seemed like the context was higherspending individuals concerned about tax efficiency . But I still thought Id ask for a sanity check on whether Im missing some major problems . Thanks ."

      "selftext": "I’m doing some research on this stock, seems like it could be a moonshot or burnout stock. What y’all say? ImmunityBio (NASDAQ: IBRX) is a small/mid-cap biotech focused on cancer immunotherapy. It just received FDA-approval for a bladder cancer drug ANKTIVA. ImmunityBio is trying to train/boost the immune system (especially NK cells + T cells) to fight cancer more effectively and for longer duration. Their flagship product is ANKTIVA (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln), an IL-15 receptor agonist designed to activate immune cells. FDA progress ImmunityBio announced a Type B End-of-Phase meeting with the FDA regarding its supplemental Biologics License Application for ANKTIVA plus Bacillus Calmette–Guérin in BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The FDA requested additional information but did not require new clinical trials. ImmunityBio plans to submit the requested data within 30 days, supporting a potential resubmission without further trials. This reduces regulatory uncertainty and supports the stock’s rally. ⸻ Analyst upgrade Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on ImmunityBio and raised its price target from $5 to $7. This upgrade reflects increased confidence in the company’s regulatory progress and commercial prospects, contributing to positive investor sentiment and the stock’s strong gain. Revenue and trial updates ImmunityBio reported a 700% revenue increase in 2025, driven by rapid growth of its lead drug Anktiva. Clinical trials. I bought a few stocks yesterday m, just to test the waters. It seems to be very high risk & high reward kind of stock. Thoughts?",

What y ’ all say ImmunityBio NASDAQ IBRX is a smallmidcap biotech focused on cancer immunotherapy . It just received FDAapproval for a bladder cancer drug ANKTIVA . ImmunityBio is trying to trainboost the immune system especially NK cells T cells to fight cancer more effectively and for longer duration . Their flagship product is ANKTIVA nogapendekin alfa inbakiceptpmln an IL15 receptor agonist designed to activate immune cells . FDA progress ImmunityBio announced a Type B EndofPhase meeting with the FDA regarding its supplemental Biologics License Application for ANKTIVA plus Bacillus Calmette–Guérin in BCGunresponsive nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer . The FDA requested additional information but did not_require new clinical trials . ImmunityBio plans to submit the requested data within 30 days supporting a potential resubmission without further trials . This reduces regulatory uncertainty and supports the stock ’ s rally . ⸻ Analyst upgrade Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on ImmunityBio and raised its price target from $ 5 to $ 7 . This upgrade reflects increased confidence in the company ’ s regulatory progress and commercial prospects contributing to positive investor sentiment and the stock ’ s strong gain . Revenue and trial updates ImmunityBio reported a 700 % revenue increase in 2025 driven by rapid growth of its lead drug Anktiva . Clinical trials . I bought a few stocks yesterday m just to test the waters . It seems to be very high risk high reward kind of stock . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "[ Fortunately, scientists have figured out how to harness actinium-225's power for good. They can attach it to molecules that can home in on only cancer cells. In clinical trials treating late-stage prostate cancer patients, actinium-225 wiped out the cancer in three treatments. \"There is no residual impact of the prostate cancer. It's remarkable,” said Kevin John, a researcher at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Actinium-225 and treatments derived from it have also been used in [early trials]( for leukemia, melanoma, and glioma. But something stood in the way of expanding this treatment. For decades, one place in the world has produced the majority of actinium-225: DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Even with two other international facilities contributing smaller amounts, all three combined can only create enough actinium-225 to treat fewer than 100 patients annually. That's not enough to run anything but the most preliminary of clinical trials [ 1) Why don't US government speed up the approval for such drugs when the filing took place in June 2024? [ BWXT Medical Ltd., a subsidiary of BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BWXT) and NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes, LLC (NorthStar) today announced that they have signed a Master Services Agreement (MSA), which will facilitate the production of actinium-225 (Ac-225), a critical medical isotope used to kill cancer cells while minimizing the impact to healthy tissues. 2) Strategic US govt equity investment into BWXT, which can then be used to greatly speed up the production of Ac-225. If targeting 1kg of Ac-225 is even remotely attainable that can greatly pay down the US govt debt.",

In clinical trials treating latestage prostate cancer patients actinium225 wiped out the cancer in three treatments . There is no_residual impact of the prostate cancer . Its remarkable ” said Kevin John a researcher at the Department of Energys DOE Los Alamos National Laboratory LANL . Actinium225 and treatments derived from it have also been used in early trials for leukemia melanoma and glioma . But something stood in the way of expanding this treatment . For decades one place in the world has produced the majority of actinium225 DOEs Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL . Even with two other international facilities contributing smaller amounts all three combined can only create enough actinium225 to treat fewer than 100 patients annually . Thats not_enough to run anything but the most preliminary of clinical trials 1 Why dont US government speed up the approval for such drugs when the filing took place in June 2024 BWXT Medical Ltd. a subsidiary of BWX Technologies Inc. NYSE BWXT and NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes LLC NorthStar today announced that they have signed a Master Services Agreement MSA which will facilitate the production of actinium225 Ac225 a critical medical isotope used to kill cancer cells while minimizing the impact to healthy tissues . 2 Strategic US govt equity investment into BWXT which can then be used to greatly speed up the production of Ac225 . If targeting 1kg of Ac225 is even remotely attainable that can greatly pay down the US govt debt ."

Plus, we will roll over whichever maximum amount into a Roth IRA when the time comes. We are in a state where UTMA accounts can be granted at 21, and delayed until 25 if you decide. We would like to do the main portion of investing for them in these UTMA accounts. I am looking to build a good set it and forget it portfolio and buy 2-4 broad based stocks for them weekly/monthly. Based on my research, it seems like something like some allocation of VTI - VXUS - RSP - and QQQ would be decent. Would these 4 funds be a good base set it and forget it for weekly/monthly buys? If not, what funds? Also, what allocation of these or different funds? Appreciate everyone’s insight in helping set up our kids future!",

      "title": "Why copper investors should stop thinking in single tickers",
      "selftext": "The most interesting copper angle right now is not the price chart, it is the physics. Advanced systems like radar, satellites, lasers, and AI infrastructure are only practical at scale because copper can move power efficiently, carry heat away from dense electronics, and maintain grounding and signal integrity. Copper is not always the active ingredient, but without it, reliability and performance fall apart. That helps explain why demand projections look sticky. You shared estimates that global copper demand could rise from around 25 Mt per year today to 33-35 Mt by 2030 and potentially 50-55 Mt by 2050. Electrification adds copper intensity, and AI data centers add another layer because power distribution and thermal management become the limiting factors as rack densities climb. Now connect that to stocks. A single ticker rarely captures the whole copper setup because different parts of the pipeline respond differently. A producer can benefit from price strength and operational execution. A developer can move on permitting, capex clarity, and financing milestones. An explorer can move on targets and drilling, even without revenue. That is why I prefer a watchlist that spans risk layers. For producer exposure with different profiles, you could track Capstone Copper (TSX: CS, OTC: CSCCF), Lundin Mining (TSX: LUN, OTC: LUNMF), and First Quantum Minerals (TSX: FM, OTC: FQVLF). For the longer-cycle supply pipeline, Ivanhoe Mines (TSX: IVN, OTC: IVPAF) is a developer-style name people often associate with future copper supply. Then for pure optionality, keep Rumble Resources (CSE: RB, often shown as RB.CN on Yahoo Finance) as the speculative end of the barbell. If the demand drivers are structural and supply takes a decade-plus to respond, do you think the market starts rewarding the whole pipeline, or does it still mostly pay producers and ignore the upstream names?

      "selftext_processed": "The most interesting copper angle right now is not_the price chart it is the physics . Advanced systems like radar satellites lasers and AI infrastructure are only practical at scale because copper can move power efficiently carry heat away from dense electronics and maintain grounding and signal integrity . Copper is not_always the active ingredient but without it reliability and performance fall apart . That helps explain why demand projections look sticky . You shared estimates that global copper demand could rise from around 25 Mt per year today to 3335 Mt by 2030 and potentially 5055 Mt by 2050 . Electrification adds copper intensity and AI data centers add another layer because power distribution and thermal management become the limiting factors as rack densities climb . Now connect that to stocks . A single ticker rarely captures the whole copper setup because different parts of the pipeline respond differently . A producer can benefit from price strength and operational execution . A developer can move on permitting capex clarity and financing milestones . An explorer can move on targets and drilling even without revenue . That is why I prefer a watchlist that spans risk layers . For producer exposure with different profiles you could track Capstone Copper TSX CS OTC CSCCF Lundin Mining TSX LUN OTC LUNMF and First Quantum Minerals TSX FM OTC FQVLF . For the longercycle supply pipeline Ivanhoe Mines TSX IVN OTC IVPAF is a developerstyle name people often associate with future copper supply . Then for pure optionality keep Rumble Resources CSE RB often shown as RB.CN on Yahoo Finance as the speculative end of the barbell . If the demand drivers are structural and supply takes a decadeplus to respond do you think the market starts rewarding the whole pipeline or does it still mostly pay producers and ignore the upstream names NFA ."

      "selftext": "RIME’s recent move makes more sense when you treat it as a reclassification event. For a long time, the ticker was mentally filed under \"legacy junk\" and ignored. Once that mental label breaks, price can move fast because the market isn’t updating a price target, it’s updating a category. The numbers behind the new category are what matter. SemiCab’s deck points to enterprise-scale execution: about 173K loads run through the platform in a defined window, roughly 77% optimized, with around 11.7M miles removed and about $28.5M saved on roughly $340M of freight spend. That’s an 8%+ savings impact. Not theory. Then compare that to what the market is valuing the company at. With roughly 2.72M shares outstanding, even around the $0.80–$1.00 zone you’re talking about a market cap of only \\~$2.4M to $2.7M. That’s tiny relative to the scale implied by multi-million annual contracts and ARR discussion. That’s why the tape changed. When people stop thinking \"old business\" and start thinking \"logistics optimization with measurable savings,\" they stop selling dips and start buying them. Not advice, do your own reading.",

      "selftext": "Bloomberg) -- The Danish pension fund AkademikerPension is planning to exit US Treasuries by the end of the month, amid concerns that the policies of President Donald Trump have created credit risks too big to ignore. “The US is basically not a good credit and long-term the US government finances are not sustainable,” Anders Schelde, chief investment officer at AkademikerPension, told Bloomberg on Tuesday. AkademikerPension, which manages around $25 billion in savings for teachers and academics, held about $100 million in US Treasuries at the end of 2025, Schelde said. Risk and liquidity management is the only reason to remain in Treasuries, and “we decided that we can find alternative to that,” he said. Schelde cited Trump’s threats to take over Greenland as part of the reason to sell US Treasuries. But concerns about fiscal discipline and a weaker dollar also justify a retreat from US exposure, he said.",

AkademikerPension which manages around $ 25 billion in savings for teachers and academics held about $ 100 million in US Treasuries at the end of 2025 Schelde said . Risk and liquidity management is the only reason to remain in Treasuries and “ we decided that we can find alternative to that ” he said . Schelde cited Trump ’ s threats to take over Greenland as part of the reason to sell US Treasuries . But concerns about fiscal discipline and a weaker dollar also justify a retreat from US exposure he said ."

My investment strategy is largely VOO and chill. I just took control of most of my retirement funds in rollover IRAs and HSAs. In my young 30s and just crossed the $100k in networth - and 80% of it is in VOO because I just want to do time in the market. However, I'm partially convinced the Trump administration's strategy is to make a ridiculous geopolitical move that is \"pre-announced\" on a Friday to give investors time to speculate and time the market, and point to sudden bull runs when their approval rating dips. Then again, things haven't moved in a way one would expect with Venezuela. Gone are the days where conventional wisdom applies given unconditional politics? Try and time the market or should I focus more on the chill part of VOO & chill?",

My investment strategy is largely VOO and chill . I just took control of most of my retirement funds in rollover IRAs and HSAs . In my young 30s and just crossed the $ 100k in networth and 80 % of it is in VOO because I just want to do time in the market . However Im partially convinced the Trump administrations strategy is to make a ridiculous geopolitical move that is preannounced on a Friday to give investors time to speculate and time the market and point to sudden bull runs when their approval rating dips . Then again things havent moved in a way one would expect with Venezuela . Gone are the days where conventional wisdom applies given unconditional politics Try and time the market or should I focus more on the chill part of VOO chill"

Stocks free fall again like they did in April 2025, but back then the Trump admin did try damage control and paused or rolled back measures and reached deals with several partners. However, it looks quite different this time. Trump has a very specific demand that the EU is entirely unwilling to budge on, and moreover, he is much less grounded than he was last year. It seems extremely likely that he'll stick to the tariffs he threatened. We have to be in for a long winter.",

Stocks free fall again like they did in April 2025 but back then the Trump admin did try damage control and paused or rolled back measures and reached deals with several partners . However it looks quite different this time . Trump has a very specific demand that the EU is entirely unwilling to budge on and moreover he is much less grounded than he was last year . It seems extremely likely that hell stick to the tariffs he threatened . We have to be in for a long winter ."

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I don't own any individual stocks, and most of my investments are in growth mutual funds. I have some bond exposure in my 401k, but everything in my personal accounts is a mix between S&P500 (FXAIX), large cap growth (FSPGX) and semiconductor (FSELX.) I do realize there's quite a bit of overlap between these three mutual funds. Looking at the performance over the few years I've owned these, FSELX has blown everything out of the water by a large margin. Now I'm more inclined to invest a larger percentage of my money in FSELX. I realize we don't have crystal balls and we can't predict the future, but can you think of plausible scenarios where the semiconductor, microchip and AI sectors completely go bust? The more I look at the world around me, the more I'm convinced there's no plausible way, but I would love to hear your opinions. Many thanks in advance!! =)",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone I dont own any individual stocks and most of my investments are in growth mutual funds . I have some bond exposure in my 401k but everything in my personal accounts is a mix between SP500 FXAIX large cap growth FSPGX and semiconductor FSELX . I do realize theres quite a bit of overlap between these three mutual funds . Looking at the performance over the few years Ive owned these FSELX has blown everything out of the water by a large margin . Now Im more inclined to invest a larger percentage of my money in FSELX . I realize we dont have crystal balls and we cant predict the future but can you think of plausible scenarios where the semiconductor microchip and AI sectors completely go bust The more I look at the world around me the more Im convinced theres no_plausible way but I would love to hear your opinions . Many thanks in advance"

      "selftext": "Russell 2000 hit an all-time high Friday and has now outperformed the S&P 500 for 11 straight days - longest streak since June 2008. **Whats driving this?** The thesis is straightforward.. stock prices track earnings growth over time. Since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, S&P 500 earnings have grown around 27% cumulatively, driven largely by the AI buildout and concentrated in mega-cap tech. Small-cap earnings over that period? Essentially flat. That equation is now reversing: * Nasdaq 100 earnings growth is decelerating.. +36.8% in 2024 down to +18% expected in 2025 * Meanwhile earnings growth for the broader market is accelerating Looking at 2026 expectations per FactSet: * S&P 500: +15% * S&P 400 mid-caps: +17% * S&P 600 small-caps: +19% * Russell 2000: +60% (includes companies currently unprofitable turning positive) **Why small caps specifically?** Small-cap strength historically signals investor confidence in the domestic economy - these companies have less international exposure. It also suggests expectations for continued rate cuts since smaller companies tend to carry more leverage and benefit more from lower borrowing costs. **The counter-argument:** Small caps are notoriously volatile and have underperformed large caps for most of the past decade. The Russell 2000 only recently broke out of a multi-year range. Some argue this is just mean reversion rather than a durable trend shift. **Also worth noting on precious metals:** Gold and silver have gone parabolic since last April with silver more than tripling. Central banks have been aggressively adding to gold reserves while diversifying away from Treasuries. However the gold/S&P 500 ratio is now sitting right at its long-term average - historically for gold to continue outperforming from here would require either excessive stock valuations or global financial instability (like 2008 or the early 80s inflation). 🗄️ Please see disclaimers here: [Redditr/dubapp]( Curious what everyone's thinking heading into earnings season 👇",

      "selftext": "I've been posting my thesis for some of the stocks below on why I think they are undervalued, feel free to roast me or not, although I feel pretty secure about them. **1. Amaroq Minerals ($AMRQ)** * **Thesis:** Amaroq has successfully transitioned from \"explorer\" to \"producer,\" recently beating FY25 gold production guidance. The real story is strategic: The West is desperate to secure critical minerals (Gold/Copper) outside of Chinese influence, and Amaroq effectively owns the rights to South Greenland. * **2026 Catalyst:** The Phase 2 plant upgrade lands in Q2 2026. This boosts recovery rates to \\~90%, turning this into a cash-flow machine just as gold prices hold historic highs. **2. Ferrari ($RACE)** * **Thesis:** Stop looking at P/E ratios; this trades like Hermès, not Ford. The order book is entirely sold out through 2026. Their customer base is immune to interest rates and inflation, and they have arguably the strongest pricing power of any company on earth. * **2026 Catalyst:** Lewis Hamilton’s second season in Red + the imminent launch of their first EV. The market expects the EV to be sold out before the public even sees it. **3. Aston Martin ($AML)** * **Thesis:** The contrarian pick. The stock has been battered, creating a distressed valuation (0.4x sales). The thesis relies entirely on the successful delivery of the *Valhalla* supercar in 2026 and debt stabilization. * **2026 Catalyst:** If they deliver cars on time this year, the stock re-rates from \"bankruptcy risk\" to \"luxury brand.\" High risk, massive potential upside. **4. Fluor ($FLR)** * **Thesis:** Fluor has \"de-risked\" its backlog, 82% of its contracts are now reimbursable (meaning the client pays for cost overruns, not Fluor). They are the ones actually building the data centers for hyperscalers and have a massive footprint in the Nuclear/SMR renaissance. * **2026 Catalyst:** Aggressive share buybacks continuing through Feb 2026 and the monetization of their NuScale (SMR) stake. **5. L3Harris ($LHX)** * **Thesis:** Unlike the slow-moving \"metal benders\" (Lockheed/Northrop), LHX focuses on the high-growth tech layer of defense: space, cyber, and comms. They are the \"trusted disruptor\" in a sector seeing increased budget allocation. * **2026 Catalyst:** The planned spin-off of their Missile Solutions unit later in 2026. This unlocks shareholder value and leaves a leaner, higher-margin tech core. **6. Capital One ($COF)** * **Thesis:** The play is the Discover acquisition. By owning the Discover network, COF creates a closed-loop system (issuer + network) that lets them bypass Visa/Mastercard fees and capture the entire transaction margin. Even without it, it’s a tech-forward bank trading at a value multiple. (10% C/C Cap Highly Unlikely to go through) * **2026 Catalyst:** Realizing the projected $2.7B in synergies. **7. NextEra Energy ($NEE)** * **Thesis:** AI Data centers consume an insane amount of electricity. NextEra is the largest renewable developer in the US and the only one with the scale (\\~30GW backlog) to power the AI boom. You get the safety of a regulated utility (Florida Power & Light) attached to a high-growth tech play. * **2026 Catalyst:** Confirmed 10% dividend growth through 2026 and massive demand from hyperscalers (Google/Microsoft) signing long-term power purchase agreements.",

      "selftext": "I’m not usually a metals investor. I mostly stick to equities, ETFs, and some crypto. But given the current political and macro backdrop, I’m starting to question whether ignoring gold and silver right now is actually the bigger risk. Gold and silver have been in a very strong uptrend over the past days and weeks. Gold is trading around $4,675–$4,690/oz, up roughly +1.8% to +1.9% today, while silver is near $94/oz, up +5% to +6.6% today. Silver has been especially volatile, up about +25% YTD (2026) and roughly +200% over the past year. From a macro perspective, this looks like a classic **safe-haven rally**, driven by several overlapping factors: * **Geopolitical tensions**: renewed trade-war risks, US–Europe tariff threats, and broader instability are pushing investors toward defensive assets. * **Macro uncertainty**: a weaker US dollar, uncertainty around Fed leadership and rate cuts, persistent inflation, and rising global debt levels. * **Central bank behavior**: continued strong gold purchases, especially from China, as part of reserve diversification. * **Silver-specific dynamics**: rising industrial demand (electrification, AI infrastructure, crypto-related hardware), structural supply deficits, export restrictions, and its classification as a critical mineral in the US. Some analysts (Citi, JPMorgan) are talking about **$5,000 gold** and **$100 silver** into 2026, though that obviously comes with downside risks. A pullback from profit-taking seems very possible after such a sharp move, even if the broader trend remains bullish. I’m personally conflicted. On one hand, this feels late in the move. On the other, if the political and macro situation deteriorates further, not having any exposure to precious metals could be a blind spot in my portfolio. I’m not looking at physical metals, but rather trading exposure, which makes it easier to follow institutional flows and manage risk. That said, I’m aware metals behave very differently from equities and crypto. Even crypto platforms, Bitget, for example, now offer gold and silver trading through their TradFi products, which I’ve already tested from a trading perspective. Execution is fast and fees are low. Given the current geopolitical tensions, I have also identified a potential stock that could benefit from a surge despite the instability on Bitget Stock Futures. **Palantir ($PLTR)**: military data analysis and intelligence fusion. Demand typically increases during periods of heightened security alerts, especially in light of the potential risk of a U.S. intervention in Greenland and the situation in Iran ( a near-total nationwide internet blackout (around 99% disruption since January 8, confirmed by NetBlocks and cybersecurity experts), as well as widespread jamming of Starlink satellite internet using military-grade interference, with packet loss reaching up to 80% in some areas. Despite bans and active crackdowns by authorities, an estimated 50,000 smuggled terminals remain in use). However, this time I’m clearly talking about investing rather than short-term trading, which is why I’m approaching it differently. Curious to hear how others here are thinking about this: * Are gold and silver still effective hedges at these levels? * Is this a structural shift, or just a crowded trade waiting for a correction? * How (if at all) are you integrating metals into a portfolio that’s otherwise equity-heavy? Not looking for predictions, just thoughtful perspectives.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m not_usually a metals investor . I mostly stick to equities ETFs and some crypto . But given the current political and macro backdrop I ’ m starting to question whether ignoring gold and silver right now is actually the bigger risk . Gold and silver have been in a very strong uptrend over the past days and weeks . Gold is trading around $ 4675– $ 4690oz up roughly 1.8 % to 1.9 % today while silver is near $ 94oz up 5 % to 6.6 % today . Silver has been especially volatile up about 25 % YTD 2026 and roughly 200 % over the past year . From a macro perspective this looks like a classic safehaven rally driven by several overlapping factors Geopolitical tensions renewed tradewar risks US–Europe tariff threats and broader instability are pushing investors toward defensive assets . Macro uncertainty a weaker US dollar uncertainty around Fed leadership and rate cuts persistent inflation and rising global debt levels . Central bank behavior continued strong gold purchases especially from China as part of reserve diversification . Silverspecific dynamics rising industrial demand electrification AI infrastructure cryptorelated hardware structural supply deficits export restrictions and its classification as a critical mineral in the US . Some analysts Citi JPMorgan are talking about $ 5000 gold and $ 100 silver into 2026 though that obviously comes with downside risks . A pullback from profittaking seems very possible after such a sharp move even if the broader trend remains bullish . I ’ m personally conflicted . On one hand this feels late in the move . On the other if the political and macro situation deteriorates further not_having any exposure to precious metals could be a blind spot in my portfolio . I ’ m not_looking at physical metals but rather trading exposure which makes it easier to follow institutional flows and manage risk . That said I ’ m aware metals behave very differently from equities and crypto . Even crypto platforms Bitget for example now offer gold and silver trading through their TradFi products which I ’ ve already tested from a trading perspective . Execution is fast and fees are low . Given the current geopolitical tensions I have also identified a potential stock that could benefit from a surge despite the instability on Bitget Stock Futures . Palantir $ PLTR military data analysis and intelligence fusion . Demand typically increases during periods of heightened security alerts especially in light of the potential risk of a U.S. intervention in Greenland and the situation in Iran a neartotal nationwide internet blackout around 99 % disruption since January 8 confirmed by NetBlocks and cybersecurity experts as well as widespread jamming of Starlink satellite internet using militarygrade interference with packet loss reaching up to 80 % in some areas . Despite bans and active crackdowns by authorities an estimated 50000 smuggled terminals remain in use . However this time I ’ m clearly talking about investing rather than shortterm trading which is why I ’ m approaching it differently . Curious to hear how others here are thinking about this Are gold and silver still effective hedges at these levels Is this a structural shift or just a crowded trade waiting for a correction How if at all are you integrating metals into a portfolio that ’ s otherwise equityheavy Not_looking for predictions just thoughtful perspectives ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been seeing bullish thesis’s for ADBE everywhere. I get it. Adobe is a great company. But ADBE is not a great stock. Most claims I hear are “great earnings” “Growth on sale” “moat + shrinking forward PE” or similar. In his book “The Most Important Thing,” Howard Marks proposes the concept of second-level thinking, which is a more complex analysis compared to first level-thinking, which is a more superficial one. I think there’s a lot of first-level thinking on ADBE in the market right now. A lot of investor price anchoring. And a lot of fixation on accounting profit growth, instead of real compounding growth. I say this because most of the earnings growth is supported by share buybacks and not from increasing cash flow from operations. In FY 21, ADBE had 7.23 Billion in CFO, and repurchased $4.67 Billion common stock. In FY 25, adobe had $10 Billion in CFO and $12 Billion in share buybacks. So in a 5 year period, the CFO grew at 8.45% cagr, while the share buybacks grew at 26.61%. But notice that current unearned revenue increased by 0.774 B in 2025. If you do a CFO 4-year cagr that’s adjusted for cash received for services rendered, ADBE’s 4-year cash flow growth is 6.28% Why make this adjustment? Because unearned revenue is extra cash today for future liabilities. (Likely to be 2026 cash flow headwinds) Now to round out my analysis, I calculate the rough cagr of CPI inflation 2021-2025: about 6%. Net these cagr’s: 6.28-6 =0.28% Adjusted for services rendered and inflation 0.28% CFO cagr for ADBE 2021-2025- basically adobe’s CFO is moving in lockstep with inflation Earnings growth had a CAGR of 13.5% roughly, so the PE multiple improvement seems to be exclusively from inflation and buybacks. Since the rate of buyback increase can’t mathematically continue, it’s likely the metrics that justify a higher share price have negative convexity on the horizon. Overall, I’m not saying ADBE is deteriorating, but I am saying most of the reasons people give to forecast a higher share price, are based on deceivingly optimistic metrics.",

Equally striking is how little markets seem to care. Despite the barrage of policy shocks, the S&P 500 has risen 3.3 per cent over the past month, while the ASX 200 has outperformed with a 3.7 per cent gain. That strength reflects Australia’s exposure to booming commodity markets, where surging gold and silver prices, along with another jump in copper, have driven solid gains for resources stocks.

Macquarie strategist Viktor Shvets argues it’s largely the latter, noting that investors are notoriously poor at pricing political and geopolitical risk. [ [",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, As you probably know, Jerome Powell is expected to step down from the Fed at the end of May. Over the last few months, Trump has been pushing hard for interest rate cuts, but Powell has held off, mainly because the US job market is still fairly strong and inflation remains a bit too high. Once Powell leaves, Trump will be the one appointing his replacement, and it seems reasonable to assume that a Fed chair chosen by Trump might be more open to cutting rates. Rate cuts usually make borrowing cheaper for companies, which can boost hiring and speed up economic activity, in simple terms, that’s generally good for the S&P 500. On the flip side, they also tend to push inflation higher and often weaken the dollar against the euro. Given this, do you think it makes sense to switch from a euro-denominated S&P 500 index fund to a currency-hedged one? For anyone who hasn’t really felt the impact of dollar weakness, just look at the numbers: over the last year, the S&P 500 is up about 17% in USD, but only around 4% in EUR. I'm Portuguese and that's why don't want it in dollars.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone As you probably know Jerome Powell is expected to step down from the Fed at the end of May . Over the last few months Trump has been pushing hard for interest rate cuts but Powell has held off mainly because the US job market is still fairly strong and inflation remains a bit too high . Once Powell leaves Trump will be the one appointing his replacement and it seems reasonable to assume that a Fed chair chosen by Trump might be more open to cutting rates . Rate cuts usually make borrowing cheaper for companies which can boost hiring and speed up economic activity in simple terms that ’ s generally good for the SP 500 . On the flip side they also tend to push inflation higher and often weaken the dollar against the euro . Given this do you think it makes sense to switch from a eurodenominated SP 500 index fund to a currencyhedged one For anyone who hasn ’ t really felt the impact of dollar weakness just look at the numbers over the last year the SP 500 is up about 17 % in USD but only around 4 % in EUR . Im Portuguese and thats why dont want it in dollars ."

      "title": "Volume III: Greenland & The Inevitable - Why Uranium Rare Earths and Strategic Materials Are About to Break the Market",
      "selftext": "Alright, I am back with Volume III. If you listened to me in late December, you should now be up around 45% YTD holding long. Here is my next piece as we continue to track global events and the rare earths bananza continues to take hold: —— **My portfolio (UUUU, MP, CCJ, LYC, LEU)** is not a bet on higher spot prices. It is a bet on physical bottlenecks colliding with geopolitics, energy security, and capital rotation. The market is still underestimating how violent that collision will be. The desire for Greenland is not reckless, it was inevitable. It is the visible phase of a transition that was locked in years ago…. We are entering a period where governments and utilities will pay whatever they must to secure supply of rare earths and materials. When that happens equity repricing does not happen gradually. It happens all at once. Like a fucking Hurricane. **The Macro Thesis** I. Energy security has replaced cost efficiency. II. China’s dominance is now politically intolerable. III. Supply chains cannot be rebuilt on demand. IV. Demand is inelastic and accelerating. V. Capital is rotating away from over owned growth and toward physical chokepoints. Greenland was the accelerant not the cause. The moment Greenland entered the geopolitical spotlight markets were reminded of a simple truth - just like Venezuela. **The West does not control the materials it needs to function**. That realization does not lead to negotiation. It leads to stockpiling long term contracts and panic bidding. **Why This Was Set in Stone Years Ago China Won Africa** None of this started in Greenland. Greenland is the flashpoint not the origin. The origin was a twenty year strategic campaign where China secured the physical foundation of the global economy while the West assumed markets and interdependence would enable the continuation of their growth and supremacy. Beginning in the early 2000s China made a deliberate choice. Control the inputs not the brands. While the West shut down processing, delayed permits, financialized commodities and treated minerals as cyclical trades, China invested directly in mines, built roads, ports and rail while using state backed capital for long term access to resources. **Africa was the centerpiece.** Across the DRC, Zambia, Namibia, Guinea, Zimbabwe and beyond, China locked up cobalt, copper, lithium, rare earths manganese, and graphite, not through spot markets but through multi decade offtake agreements and state to state deals the West refused to touch (because were politically correct pansies playing a game against realists who understood this mineral war years ago). Once those contracts were signed the game was over. The molecules were spoken for. China now controls the majority of rare earths. We’re fucked and now we’re panicking. **The West’s Mistake and Why It Cannot Be Fixed Quickly** 1). The West assumed supply would always be available. 2). That China would remain a neutral trade partner. 3). That ESG frameworks and markets could replace strategy. By the time policymakers woke up the supply chain had already hardened. You cannot rebuild mines in two years. You cannot rebuild processing in three. You cannot recreate workforce expertise overnight. You cannot manufacture social license on demand. China did not win because it was smarter. It won because it was earlier and planned for the long term future. **What we are watching now is not a transition. It is a forced unwind of a twenty year mistake.** Emergency funding long term contracts, ensuring strategic stockpiles and national security exemptions are all symptoms of the same realization. Time no longer exists. **Why Greenland Changed Everything** Greenland forced the issue into the open. It reminded markets and policymakers that strategic minerals are geographically constrained, that supply chains are political, and that China already made its move. This is not a new arms race. It is the late innings of one that already began. When time disappears price stops mattering. **The Companies and the Bottlenecks They Control (and how to make money from this)** This portfolio (UUUU, MP, CCJ, LYC, & LEU) is not a collection of commodity stocks. *It is a collection of chokepoint owners.* **Energy Fuels** controls one of the only domestic pathways in the United States for converting uranium into usable nuclear fuel and separating rare earth oxides. Mining without processing is irrelevant. Processing is the bottleneck. As supply nationalism accelerates Energy Fuels becomes policy infrastructure not a trade. **Cameco** sits at the center of Western uranium supply. Utilities do not want exposure to geopolitics. They want certainty. Cameco controls scalable politically acceptable supply at the exact moment utilities are pulling contracts forward and locking volumes for decades. This is not price leverage. It is contract leverage. **Centrus** controls enrichment. Mining is step one. Enrichment is the gate. SMRs require HALEU. HALEU barely exists. Russia dominates enrichment and that is no longer acceptable. Centrus is not leveraged to spot uranium. It is leveraged to national security timelines. **MP Materials** controls the only large scale rare earth mine in the United States. No mine means no supply. No supply means no EVs no defense systems no AI hardware. Processing will follow but mining is the choke. **Lynas** is the only meaningful rare earth processor outside China. That single fact makes it irreplaceable. In a real supply crisis Lynas does not compete. It gets allocated. YTD, this portfolio is up 40%. Tomorrow (and for the rest of Q1 and beyond) we should expect another major rally. **Final Thoughts** This is not a meme stock play. This is structural. A Face melting lift off based around our world changing and the minerals needed to ensure it operates. Join the ride!",

      "selftext_processed": "Alright I am back with Volume III . If you listened to me in late December you should now be up around 45 % YTD holding long . Here is my next piece as we continue to track global events and the rare earths bananza continues to take hold —— My portfolio UUUU MP CCJ LYC LEU is not_a bet on higher spot prices . It is a bet on physical bottlenecks colliding with geopolitics energy security and capital rotation . The market is still underestimating how violent that collision will be . The desire for Greenland is not_reckless it was inevitable . It is the visible phase of a transition that was locked in years ago… . We are entering a period where governments and utilities will pay whatever they must to secure supply of rare earths and materials . When that happens equity repricing does not_happen gradually . It happens all at once . Like a fucking Hurricane . The Macro Thesis I . Energy security has replaced cost efficiency . II . China ’ s dominance is now politically intolerable . III . Supply chains can not be rebuilt on demand . IV . Demand is inelastic and accelerating . V. Capital is rotating away from over owned growth and toward physical chokepoints . Greenland was the accelerant not_the cause . The moment Greenland entered the geopolitical spotlight markets were reminded of a simple truth just like Venezuela . The West does not_control the materials it needs to function . That realization does not_lead to negotiation . It leads to stockpiling long term contracts and panic bidding . Why This Was Set in Stone Years Ago China Won Africa None of this started in Greenland . Greenland is the flashpoint not_the origin . The origin was a twenty year strategic campaign where China secured the physical foundation of the global economy while the West assumed markets and interdependence would enable the continuation of their growth and supremacy . Beginning in the early 2000s China made a deliberate choice . Control the inputs not_the brands . While the West shut down processing delayed permits financialized commodities and treated minerals as cyclical trades China invested directly in mines built roads ports and rail while using state backed capital for long term access to resources . Africa was the centerpiece . Across the DRC Zambia Namibia Guinea Zimbabwe and beyond China locked up cobalt copper lithium rare earths manganese and graphite not_through spot markets but through multi decade offtake agreements and state to state deals the West refused to touch because were politically correct pansies playing a game against realists who understood this mineral war years ago . Once those contracts were signed the game was over . The molecules were spoken for . China now controls the majority of rare earths . We ’ re fucked and now we ’ re panicking . The West ’ s Mistake and Why It Can not Be Fixed Quickly 1 . The West assumed supply would always be available . 2 . That China would remain a neutral trade partner . 3 . That ESG frameworks and markets could replace strategy . By the time policymakers woke up the supply chain had already hardened . You can not rebuild mines in two years . You can not rebuild processing in three . You can not recreate workforce expertise overnight . You can not manufacture social license on demand . China did not_win because it was smarter . It won because it was earlier and planned for the long term future . What we are watching now is not_a transition . It is a forced unwind of a twenty year mistake . Emergency funding long term contracts ensuring strategic stockpiles and national security exemptions are all symptoms of the same realization . Time no_longer exists . Why Greenland Changed Everything Greenland forced the issue into the open . It reminded markets and policymakers that strategic minerals are geographically constrained that supply chains are political and that China already made its move . This is not_a new arms race . It is the late innings of one that already began . When time disappears price stops mattering . The Companies and the Bottlenecks They Control and how to make money from this This portfolio UUUU MP CCJ LYC LEU is not_a collection of commodity stocks . It is a collection of chokepoint owners . Energy Fuels controls one of the only domestic pathways in the United States for converting uranium into usable nuclear fuel and separating rare earth oxides . Mining without processing is irrelevant . Processing is the bottleneck . As supply nationalism accelerates Energy Fuels becomes policy infrastructure not_a trade . Cameco sits at the center of Western uranium supply . Utilities do not_want exposure to geopolitics . They want certainty . Cameco controls scalable politically acceptable supply at the exact moment utilities are pulling contracts forward and locking volumes for decades . This is not_price leverage . It is contract leverage . Centrus controls enrichment . Mining is step one . Enrichment is the gate . SMRs require HALEU . HALEU barely exists . Russia dominates enrichment and that is no_longer acceptable . Centrus is not_leveraged to spot uranium . It is leveraged to national security timelines .

      "selftext": "I’m 28M and currently maxing out my Traditional 401k and fully utilizing my company's Mega Backdoor Roth (MBDR) (so $72,000 a year). I’m looking to optimize my asset location. Right now, I’m basically mirroring my allocation in both (mostly total market/S&P 500), but I’m considering if I should be more intentional about which assets sit in which tax bucket. The Question: For those with significant balances in both Traditional and Roth, how do you split your holdings? Roth priority: Do you put your highest-growth/highest-risk assets here (e.g., Small Cap Value, Emerging Markets) to maximize tax-free growth? Traditional priority: Do you keep the \"steadier\" stuff here (e.g., S&P 500, Bonds) to mitigate the future tax bill? Or do you just keep the same allocation across all accounts for simplicity? My current thoughts: I'm leaning toward putting my Small Cap tilt in the Roth side and keeping the core S&P 500 in Traditional. I have a 30+ year horizon, so I want to be aggressive, but I’m curious if I'm overthinking the \"tax drag\" vs. the simplicity of mirroring. What’s your strategy and why?",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’d like some input on a financial decision I’m considering. **Mortgage details:** * Remaining balance: €151,126.64 * Remaining term: 277 months (\\~23 years) * Interest rate: 2.65% fixed * Monthly payment: €729.94 **Available cash:** €25,000 I’m considering three options: 1. Mortgage prepayment reducing the monthly payment 2. Mortgage prepayment reducing the remaining term 3. Investing the €25,000 long-term (index funds / ETFs / stocks) over \\~23 years I already invest in an **S&P 500 ETF**, and I believe adding MSCI World would be somewhat redundant due to heavy US exposure (please correct me if I’m wrong). 👉 Main questions: * Does it make sense to prepay a mortgage at a relatively low interest rate like 2.65%? * If investing instead, which assets would best complement an S&P 500 position? * Would you split the €25,000 between mortgage prepayment and investing? If so, how? Profile: long-term horizon, medium–high risk tolerance, no short-term liquidity needs. Thanks in advance!",

Mortgage details Remaining balance €151126.64 Remaining term 277 months 23 years Interest rate 2.65 % fixed Monthly payment €729.94 Available cash €25000 I ’ m considering three options 1 . Mortgage prepayment reducing the monthly payment 2 . Mortgage prepayment reducing the remaining term 3 . Investing the €25000 longterm index funds ETFs stocks over 23 years I already invest in an SP 500 ETF and I believe adding MSCI World would be somewhat redundant due to heavy US exposure please correct me if I ’ m wrong . 👉 Main questions Does it make sense to prepay a mortgage at a relatively low interest rate like 2.65 % If investing instead which assets would best complement an SP 500 position Would you split the €25000 between mortgage prepayment and investing If so how Profile longterm horizon medium–high risk tolerance no_shortterm liquidity needs . Thanks in advance"

Basically I’m unsure of what route to go with it. I have no debt, my credit is okay. I’ve thought about investing or just leaving in my Webull account to average in. My current portfolio is just north of 6k. I’d like to split it up somehow within some low risk stocks/etfs I would just like to get some opinions on what you would do. Or maybe a CD? I’m not financially illiterate but I definitely need advice. Thanks.",

      "selftext": "Everyone seems to know feel that valuations are high. J.P. Morgan recently released data showing that when the S&P 500 trades at forward P/E ratios around 22x (where we are now), subsequent 10-year returns have historically ranged between +2% and -2%. For example -> Japan in 1989 was unstoppable and from a period of 15 years (1974 to 1989), the Nikkei 225 had gone up over 10x from 3600 to over 36,000. Then had 30 years of a rollercoaster after 1990 before crossing 36,000 again in 2023. What nobody seems to talk about is what we're supposed to *do* about it. Going through it, the standard options have problems: * **Treasuries**: 4-5% nominal, maybe 1-2% real adjusted for inflation. And then you have to time your re-entry. * **Gold**: Crushed it from 2000-2010 (+15% CAGR) while the S&P was flat (and now). But from 1980-1999, gold returned -6.5% annualized while stocks did +13%. * **International**: \"Cheaper\" for a decade now, but anyone who diversified has underperformed unless they did it last year. Classically it seems like most people take the route of doing nothing. Historically includes a lot of people who waited 10-30 years. The S&P 500 has done something similar in the last 16 years. Going from a low of 677 on March 2009 to 6900+ today in Jan 2026. Also 10x growth within a similar time period. Obviously a lot of what everyone is scared about is the AI bubble. Meanwhile in Japan back in 1989 I looked it up on Reddit and [anecdotes from that time make it sound more insane]( P/E ratios back then were also 60 to 80 for companies. So basically 10 to 30 years of bad returns is not unprecedented. Still Japan at least had deflation / low inflation. I'm curious on how everyone is thinking about potentially hedging.",

      "title": "The Greenland Rug Pull: Nuking the Markets for a Glacier",
      "selftext": "If the administration actually gets to a place where Greenland is up for purchase, how do you all think the markets will react? **1)** They will have to finance this thing somehow. Obviously, they can't just issue pure US debt given the political liability around the debt quantum. Bessent has signaled they could go the path of using a Sovereign Wealth Fund to finance the transaction, likely by stuffing student loans, federal land rights, or other assets and securitizing them out to investors via \"Greenland bonds.\" **2)** Those bonds will have to trade higher than standard US debt given the risk premium and novelty of the structuring (not to mention the depth of the market). Selling, say, $1-2T of these new instruments would flood the market with higher rate debt, driving prices of existing, lower-rate bond portfolios down right off the bat. There goes the bond market. **3)** The higher rates would lead to crowding out, as large institutional investors decide that holding high-rate bonds with a (basically) guaranteed return is worth more than holding equities with less certain returns. Institutional investors would sell off equities to buy larger bond portfolios (this would offset the impact of #2, but not on a 1:1 basis). Equity markets would fall as a result. **4)** The fact that these new pseudo-government bonds would be issued at a higher rate effectively increases the 'risk-free,' i.e., discount rate of the overall economy. If you were evaluating an equity's fundamental value, this increased discount rate would result in the equity being worth less than before. This is a second factor that would push the equity markets down, combined with #3. >**4.1)** The Fed could step in here and perform QE to cap rates, but in any case, this is akin to the US printing money to fund the purchase of Greenland as opposed to financing it. This would just hyper-charge the next point as the Fed creates new money to buy the excess bonds. **5)** Once the funds are raised and the government actually sends out the cash to Denmark/Greenland, it's effectively injected the global economy with $1-2T of debt, strongly raising the likelihood of inflation. Remember it's also pledged what were previously government cash flows to investors (student loans, land rights, etc.), which will create a cash flow hole for the US government that will need to be filled with either taxes, budget cuts, or everyone's favorite, more debt - i.e., more inflation, higher debt-to-GDP ratio, higher rates, and more equity (and likely bond market) depression. >**5.1)** A small, nuanced point, but the way the US will likely need to structure these bonds to make them marketable to investors will require them to retain an equity tranche in the securitization vehicle, which, if priced incorrectly would essentially 'create money,' also driving up money supply and possibly long-term inflation. **6)** Higher rates, greater inflation, and depressed equity/bond markets leaves one trade left for investors, i.e. a debasement trade in hard assets like gold/silver. Of course, gold/silver might crash at first as investors flock to the dollar/sell off for cash (won't get into emerging market dynamics here, but you can guess), but eventually the inflationary effects will get priced in and drive demand for the assets. **Takeaway)** This is highly speculative, and the future is anything but predictable. But the truth is that the US probably doesn't have the firepower to finance this thing, and the fact that any ROI on Greenland would take years to manifest implies there's no way out of buying the island without jacking up rates and inflation (which itself jacks up rates). I think the winning strategy here is all about timing a buy and sell, likely staying out of the capital markets until it becomes apparent that inflation is being priced in, at which point bond markets will have corrected and hard assets like gold/silver should begin to climb. High rates risk Fed action, and even if the Fed does bring rates down, any subsequent QE-induced inflation stands to depress bond/equity valuations in this type of environment. >**Note 1)** I do think a lot of this hinges on the ROI of buying Greenland. If it turns out that the Island can pay for the debt and generate excess returns in a timely manner, i.e., essentially immediately, then perhaps there is no excess inflation from the US printing debt to cap rates/covering cash-flow holes. I do think, though, regardless, the effect of issuing high-rate bonds to pull cash-flows forward and injecting the global economy with that capital has the capacity to trigger this general flow of events. Plus, and ROI from Greenland would take decades, well after the inflation has sunk in. >**Note 2)** There is the possibility that the political crisis this has/will cause a deterioration in trade between the EU and the US, which might limit the effects of a capital injection into the EU on the US economy - but their interlinkage is so strong, I doubt there can ever be a true wall keeping inflation east of the Atlantic.",

      "selftext_processed": "If the administration actually gets to a place where Greenland is up for purchase how do you all think the markets will react 1 They will have to finance this thing somehow . Obviously they cant just issue pure US debt given the political liability around the debt quantum . Bessent has signaled they could go the path of using a Sovereign Wealth Fund to finance the transaction likely by stuffing student loans federal land rights or other assets and securitizing them out to investors via Greenland bonds . 2 Those bonds will have to trade higher than standard US debt given the risk premium and novelty of the structuring not to mention the depth of the market . Selling say $ 12T of these new instruments would flood the market with higher rate debt driving prices of existing lowerrate bond portfolios down right off the bat . There goes the bond market . 3 The higher rates would lead to crowding out as large institutional investors decide that holding highrate bonds with a basically guaranteed return is worth more than holding equities with less certain returns . Institutional investors would sell off equities to buy larger bond portfolios this would offset the impact of 2 but not_on a 11 basis . Equity markets would fall as a result . 4 The fact that these new pseudogovernment bonds would be issued at a higher rate effectively increases the riskfree i.e . discount rate of the overall economy . If you were evaluating an equitys fundamental value this increased discount rate would result in the equity being worth less than before . This is a second factor that would push the equity markets down combined with 3 . 4.1 The Fed could step in here and perform QE to cap rates but in any case this is akin to the US printing money to fund the purchase of Greenland as opposed to financing it . This would just hypercharge the next point as the Fed creates new money to buy the excess bonds . 5 Once the funds are raised and the government actually sends out the cash to DenmarkGreenland its effectively injected the global economy with $ 12T of debt strongly raising the likelihood of inflation . Remember its also pledged what were previously government cash flows to investors student loans land rights etc . which will create a cash flow hole for the US government that will need to be filled with either taxes budget cuts or everyones favorite more debt i.e . more inflation higher debttoGDP ratio higher rates and more equity and likely bond market depression . 5.1 A small nuanced point but the way the US will likely need to structure these bonds to make them marketable to investors will require them to retain an equity tranche in the securitization vehicle which if priced incorrectly would essentially create money also driving up money supply and possibly longterm inflation . 6 Higher rates greater inflation and depressed equitybond markets leaves one trade left for investors i.e . a debasement trade in hard assets like goldsilver . Of course goldsilver might crash at first as investors flock to the dollarsell off for cash wont get into emerging market dynamics here but you can guess but eventually the inflationary effects will get priced in and drive demand for the assets . Takeaway This is highly speculative and the future is anything but predictable . But the truth is that the US probably doesnt have the firepower to finance this thing and the fact that any ROI on Greenland would take years to manifest implies theres no_way out of buying the island without jacking up rates and inflation which itself jacks up rates . I think the winning strategy here is all about timing a buy and sell likely staying out of the capital markets until it becomes apparent that inflation is being priced in at which point bond markets will have corrected and hard assets like goldsilver should begin to climb . High rates risk Fed action and even if the Fed does bring rates down any subsequent QEinduced inflation stands to depress bondequity valuations in this type of environment . Note 1 I do think a lot of this hinges on the ROI of buying Greenland . If it turns out that the Island can pay for the debt and generate excess returns in a timely manner i.e . essentially immediately then perhaps there is no_excess inflation from the US printing debt to cap ratescovering cashflow holes . I do think though regardless the effect of issuing highrate bonds to pull cashflows forward and injecting the global economy with that capital has the capacity to trigger this general flow of events . Plus and ROI from Greenland would take decades well after the inflation has sunk in . Note 2 There is the possibility that the political crisis this haswill cause a deterioration in trade between the EU and the US which might limit the effects of a capital injection into the EU on the US economy but their interlinkage is so strong I doubt there can ever be a true wall keeping inflation east of the Atlantic ."

Not_looking for 0DTE or meme lotto tickets but also not_looking for index hugging returns . Goal is to concentrate capital into a small number of quality names where the upside comes from earnings growth or structural tailwinds not_pure multiple expansion hype .

      "selftext": "&#x200B; Market Cap : 60 Billion Shares Outstanding : 150million Reason 1: Ai Data center and robotics We have a stock which is directly tied to the current market trend of AI Data centers. The current trend is that there is crazy shortages in Memory chips, and Sandisk is one of the companies that creates them. Everything from Robots, cars, data centers all need memory chips to store data. Reason 2: Google Search Trends: Google trends for SNDK worldwide for the last 90 days havent peaked, while the share price is making all time highs DAILY. Even during red market days this shit is barely red or even green. This NEVER happens to pump and dumps. Shitty pump and dumps crash the moment searches on Google drop. look at the graph yourself and compare it to any other pump and dumps you know of. It is also still less popular than the most popular stocks. I can't post links but just search up \"Google Trends\", type in SNDK and put worldwide, 90 days. Reason 3: YouTube streamers and Financial Influencers Search for SNDK on youtube. No hyped up videos from streamers, youtube influencers yet the stock is up 1000%... I get it, its already up so much. So then where are all the reddit ai bots and videos trying to hype it up? Whenever you see those bots trying to pump up the stock, thats your cue to sell yesterday. For SNDK, there's none of that so far. This makes me believe that it was all institutions quietly buying it at first, before all the retail traders. Reason 4: Analyst Price Targets You'll never see analyst price targets for shitty pump and dumps. Most updated price targets from investing firms: Mizuho: $410 when the stock was only at $300 Bernstein: $580 when it was trading at $350 RBC Capital: $400 when it was at $380 Mizuho: $700Billion in Assets under management Bernstein: $900Billion in Assets under management BC Capital: $1 Trillion in Assets under Management. These are serious predictions, not some guys in a mom's basement Reason 5: It is TINY compared to other companies 150m shares outstanding means it can move FAST compared to many other companies in the sector Micron (MU) 1.1Billion shares. Market Cap: 380Billion ASTS: 280 million shares Nvidia (NVDA) 24 Billion Shares, Market Cap: 4.5T SNDK? 150million and 60Billion Market cap. Absolutely tiny compared. Reason 6: Extended Momentum Just look at the graph, this has been pumping forever. Not 1 or 2 days, Or weeks, or months. its been pumping since IPO. That is all, good luck Positions: Feb 27 500c",

      "selftext_processed": "x200B Market Cap 60 Billion Shares Outstanding 150million Reason 1 Ai Data center and robotics We have a stock which is directly tied to the current market trend of AI Data centers . The current trend is that there is crazy shortages in Memory chips and Sandisk is one of the companies that creates them . Everything from Robots cars data centers all need memory chips to store data . Reason 2 Google Search Trends Google trends for SNDK worldwide for the last 90 days havent peaked while the share price is making all time highs DAILY . Even during red market days this shit is barely red or even green . This NEVER_happens to pump and dumps . Shitty pump and dumps crash the moment searches on Google drop . look at the graph yourself and compare it to any other pump and dumps you know of . It is also still less popular than the most popular stocks . I cant post links but just search up Google Trends type in SNDK and put worldwide 90 days . Reason 3 YouTube streamers and Financial Influencers Search for SNDK on youtube . No_hyped up videos from streamers youtube influencers yet the stock is up 1000 % ... I get it its already up so much . So then where are all the reddit ai bots and videos trying to hype it up Whenever you see those bots trying to pump up the stock thats your cue to sell yesterday . For SNDK theres none of that so far . This makes me believe that it was all institutions quietly buying it at first before all the retail traders . Reason 4 Analyst Price Targets Youll never_see analyst price targets for shitty pump and dumps . Most updated price targets from investing firms Mizuho $ 410 when the stock was only at $ 300 Bernstein $ 580 when it was trading at $ 350 RBC Capital $ 400 when it was at $ 380 Mizuho $ 700Billion in Assets under management Bernstein $ 900Billion in Assets under management BC Capital $ 1 Trillion in Assets under Management . These are serious predictions not_some guys in a moms basement Reason 5 It is TINY compared to other companies 150m shares outstanding means it can move FAST compared to many other companies in the sector Micron MU 1.1Billion shares . Market Cap 380Billion ASTS 280 million shares Nvidia NVDA 24 Billion Shares Market Cap 4.5T SNDK 150million and 60Billion Market cap . Absolutely tiny compared . Reason 6 Extended Momentum Just look at the graph this has been pumping forever . Not_1 or 2 days Or weeks or months . its been pumping since IPO . That is all good luck Positions Feb 27 500c"
