      "selftext": "Krispy Kreme clearly had a wildly bad 2025. Finishing the year -60% or so, and at one point down 75-80% Balance sheet issues, secular GLP trend, poor management and zero cost disciplines led to about $850M in debt, flat revenues YOY, and bleak outlook. There is a short interest of about 13%, or 27% of total float … and occasionally gets tested in this day & age. However around July the story changed: \\\\- dividend cut (saves $20M per Q) \\\\- cost cuts related to poor $mcd partnership \\\\- outsourced awful fleet of trucks & costs there (halfway done) \\\\- new COO whos a NZ baller and also plump \\\\- going asset light akin to a $YUM or $MCD model of refranchising \\\\- closing grocery & leaning on $cost $tgt $wmt \\\\- Giant new store in MN, strategic non cannabilizing sales… $1M in first 17 days By last Q ended 10/31 \\\\- we had positive FCF of $15M (wtf .. havent seen positive in like 2 yrs) \\\\- cutting the debt by refranchising (i.e. Japan $65M) nice royalty expected and super asset light \\\\- plan is working Summary: \\\\- $60M in debt payments per year is nuts still, this doesnt deserve any premium multiple on FCF \\\\- \\\\\\~$60-75M in FCF this year, however DOES does deserve a minimum multiple of 10x, as the growth of FCF would be astronomic \\\\- A few more large refranchising deals later, and they can slice a serious chunk of debt down to $6-700M, assuming they just hold revenues flat, and FCF would grow even more… \\\\- At $3.5 a share, or sub $600M market cap, the expectations are that they will fail quickly. Even just basic execution, and the 10x multiple on FCF will begin to draw attention especially if they can show 1-2 more positive quarters Target $6-8 by April/May \\\\-20% in a week on no news is classic Krispy Not investment advice \\\\- No Doctor",

There is a short interest of about 13 % or 27 % of total float … and occasionally gets tested in this day age . However around July the story changed dividend cut saves $ 20M per Q cost cuts related to poor $ mcd partnership outsourced awful fleet of trucks costs there halfway done new COO whos a NZ baller and also plump going asset light akin to a $ YUM or $ MCD model of refranchising closing grocery leaning on $ cost $ tgt $ wmt Giant new store in MN strategic non cannabilizing sales… $ 1M in first 17 days By last Q ended 1031 we had positive FCF of $ 15M wtf .. havent seen positive in like 2 yrs cutting the debt by refranchising i.e . Japan $ 65M nice royalty expected and super asset light plan is working Summary $ 60M in debt payments per year is nuts still this doesnt deserve any premium multiple on FCF $ 6075M in FCF this year however DOES does deserve a minimum multiple of 10x as the growth of FCF would be astronomic A few more large refranchising deals later and they can slice a serious chunk of debt down to $ 6700M assuming they just hold revenues flat and FCF would grow even more… At $ 3.5 a share or sub $ 600M market cap the expectations are that they will fail quickly . Even just basic execution and the 10x multiple on FCF will begin to draw attention especially if they can show 12 more positive quarters Target $ 68 by AprilMay 20 % in a week on no_news is classic Krispy Not_investment advice No_Doctor"

Now here’s the reason you need to be buying TTD. **Midterms.** If you take a gander at every time Trade Desk has massive earnings surprises to the upside it’s on political campaign years. TTD is at the same price it was at in June of 2020. The company is just getting destroyed but it’s also one of the most watched stocks currently on the market. Nobody wants TTD, sentiment couldn’t be worse. But watch as sentiment changes, everyone is bearish until just one positive happens with a company. At minimum you have an incredible margin of safety. If they kill earnings for two quarters at this price the forward PE goes from 18- to 12,13. And BTW TTD could implement their own AI system.",

Isn't the downside already priced in and the only logical way to go is up? That's what I figured at $195 and now its $185. I don't think I have the tolerance to watch it drop any lower but at the same time I don't want to feel like an even bigger idiot on February 4th when they announce earnings and the stock bounces back up to $230+. My real nightmare scenario is that the earnings call is bad and it drops even lower to like $170. Is thst possible? What do you guys think the likelihood of a good earnings call is in Feb? I genuinely had faith in TMO because they're always making huge moves but the general consensus seems to be \"the growth story is over, its boring now, sell the stock and forget about it\"",

Will this nightmare ever end Isnt the downside already priced in and the only logical way to go is up Thats what I figured at $ 195 and now its $ 185 . I dont think I have the tolerance to watch it drop any lower but at the same time I dont want to feel like an even bigger idiot on February 4th when they announce earnings and the stock bounces back up to $ 230 . My real nightmare scenario is that the earnings call is bad and it drops even lower to like $ 170 . Is thst possible What do you guys think the likelihood of a good earnings call is in Feb I genuinely had faith in TMO because theyre always making huge moves but the general consensus seems to be the growth story is over its boring now sell the stock and forget about it"

      "title": "So... Small caps just had their best run vs S&P 500 since 2008",
      "selftext": "Russell 2000 hit an all-time high Friday and has now outperformed the S&P 500 for 11 straight days - longest streak since June 2008. **Whats driving this?** The thesis is straightforward.. stock prices track earnings growth over time. Since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, S&P 500 earnings have grown around 27% cumulatively, driven largely by the AI buildout and concentrated in mega-cap tech. Small-cap earnings over that period? Essentially flat. That equation is now reversing: * Nasdaq 100 earnings growth is decelerating.. +36.8% in 2024 down to +18% expected in 2025 * Meanwhile earnings growth for the broader market is accelerating Looking at 2026 expectations per FactSet: * S&P 500: +15% * S&P 400 mid-caps: +17% * S&P 600 small-caps: +19% * Russell 2000: +60% (includes companies currently unprofitable turning positive) **Why small caps specifically?** Small-cap strength historically signals investor confidence in the domestic economy - these companies have less international exposure. It also suggests expectations for continued rate cuts since smaller companies tend to carry more leverage and benefit more from lower borrowing costs. **The counter-argument:** Small caps are notoriously volatile and have underperformed large caps for most of the past decade. The Russell 2000 only recently broke out of a multi-year range. Some argue this is just mean reversion rather than a durable trend shift. **Also worth noting on precious metals:** Gold and silver have gone parabolic since last April with silver more than tripling. Central banks have been aggressively adding to gold reserves while diversifying away from Treasuries. However the gold/S&P 500 ratio is now sitting right at its long-term average - historically for gold to continue outperforming from here would require either excessive stock valuations or global financial instability (like 2008 or the early 80s inflation). 🗄️ Please see disclaimers here: [Redditr/dubapp]( Curious what everyone's thinking heading into earnings season 👇",

      "selftext_processed": "Russell 2000 hit an alltime high Friday and has now outperformed the SP 500 for 11 straight days longest streak since June 2008 . Whats driving this The thesis is straightforward .. stock prices track earnings growth over time . Since ChatGPT launched in late 2022 SP 500 earnings have grown around 27 % cumulatively driven largely by the AI buildout and concentrated in megacap tech . Smallcap earnings over that period Essentially flat . That equation is now reversing Nasdaq 100 earnings growth is decelerating .. 36.8 % in 2024 down to 18 % expected in 2025 Meanwhile earnings growth for the broader market is accelerating Looking at 2026 expectations per FactSet SP 500 15 % SP 400 midcaps 17 % SP 600 smallcaps 19 % Russell 2000 60 % includes companies currently unprofitable turning positive Why small caps specifically Smallcap strength historically signals investor confidence in the domestic economy these companies have less international exposure . It also suggests expectations for continued rate cuts since smaller companies tend to carry more leverage and benefit more from lower borrowing costs . The counterargument Small caps are notoriously volatile and have underperformed large caps for most of the past decade . The Russell 2000 only recently broke out of a multiyear range . Some argue this is just mean reversion rather than a durable trend shift . Also worth noting on precious metals Gold and silver have gone parabolic since last April with silver more than tripling . Central banks have been aggressively adding to gold reserves while diversifying away from Treasuries . However the goldSP 500 ratio is now sitting right at its longterm average historically for gold to continue outperforming from here would require either excessive stock valuations or global financial instability like 2008 or the early 80s inflation . 🗄️ Please see disclaimers here Redditrdubapp Curious what everyones thinking heading into earnings season 👇"

      "title": "My 2026 Picks: Stocks I feel are Undervalued",
      "selftext": "I've been posting my thesis for some of the stocks below on why I think they are undervalued, feel free to roast me or not, although I feel pretty secure about them. **1. Amaroq Minerals ($AMRQ)** * **Thesis:** Amaroq has successfully transitioned from \"explorer\" to \"producer,\" recently beating FY25 gold production guidance. The real story is strategic: The West is desperate to secure critical minerals (Gold/Copper) outside of Chinese influence, and Amaroq effectively owns the rights to South Greenland. * **2026 Catalyst:** The Phase 2 plant upgrade lands in Q2 2026. This boosts recovery rates to \\~90%, turning this into a cash-flow machine just as gold prices hold historic highs. **2. Ferrari ($RACE)** * **Thesis:** Stop looking at P/E ratios; this trades like Hermès, not Ford. The order book is entirely sold out through 2026. Their customer base is immune to interest rates and inflation, and they have arguably the strongest pricing power of any company on earth. * **2026 Catalyst:** Lewis Hamilton’s second season in Red + the imminent launch of their first EV. The market expects the EV to be sold out before the public even sees it. **3. Aston Martin ($AML)** * **Thesis:** The contrarian pick. The stock has been battered, creating a distressed valuation (0.4x sales). The thesis relies entirely on the successful delivery of the *Valhalla* supercar in 2026 and debt stabilization. * **2026 Catalyst:** If they deliver cars on time this year, the stock re-rates from \"bankruptcy risk\" to \"luxury brand.\" High risk, massive potential upside. **4. Fluor ($FLR)** * **Thesis:** Fluor has \"de-risked\" its backlog, 82% of its contracts are now reimbursable (meaning the client pays for cost overruns, not Fluor). They are the ones actually building the data centers for hyperscalers and have a massive footprint in the Nuclear/SMR renaissance. * **2026 Catalyst:** Aggressive share buybacks continuing through Feb 2026 and the monetization of their NuScale (SMR) stake. **5. L3Harris ($LHX)** * **Thesis:** Unlike the slow-moving \"metal benders\" (Lockheed/Northrop), LHX focuses on the high-growth tech layer of defense: space, cyber, and comms. They are the \"trusted disruptor\" in a sector seeing increased budget allocation. * **2026 Catalyst:** The planned spin-off of their Missile Solutions unit later in 2026. This unlocks shareholder value and leaves a leaner, higher-margin tech core. **6. Capital One ($COF)** * **Thesis:** The play is the Discover acquisition. By owning the Discover network, COF creates a closed-loop system (issuer + network) that lets them bypass Visa/Mastercard fees and capture the entire transaction margin. Even without it, it’s a tech-forward bank trading at a value multiple. (10% C/C Cap Highly Unlikely to go through) * **2026 Catalyst:** Realizing the projected $2.7B in synergies. **7. NextEra Energy ($NEE)** * **Thesis:** AI Data centers consume an insane amount of electricity. NextEra is the largest renewable developer in the US and the only one with the scale (\\~30GW backlog) to power the AI boom. You get the safety of a regulated utility (Florida Power & Light) attached to a high-growth tech play. * **2026 Catalyst:** Confirmed 10% dividend growth through 2026 and massive demand from hyperscalers (Google/Microsoft) signing long-term power purchase agreements.",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been posting my thesis for some of the stocks below on why I think they are undervalued feel free to roast me or not_although I feel pretty secure about them . 1 . Amaroq Minerals $ AMRQ Thesis Amaroq has successfully transitioned from explorer to producer recently beating FY25 gold production guidance . The real story is strategic The West is desperate to secure critical minerals GoldCopper outside of Chinese influence and Amaroq effectively owns the rights to South Greenland . 2026 Catalyst The Phase 2 plant upgrade lands in Q2 2026 . This boosts recovery rates to 90 % turning this into a cashflow machine just as gold prices hold historic highs . 2 . Ferrari $ RACE Thesis Stop looking at PE ratios this trades like Hermès not_Ford . The order book is entirely sold out through 2026 . Their customer base is immune to interest rates and inflation and they have arguably the strongest pricing power of any company on earth . 2026 Catalyst Lewis Hamilton ’ s second season in Red the imminent launch of their first EV . The market expects the EV to be sold out before the public even sees it . 3 . Aston Martin $ AML Thesis The contrarian pick . The stock has been battered creating a distressed valuation 0.4x sales . The thesis relies entirely on the successful delivery of the Valhalla supercar in 2026 and debt stabilization . 2026 Catalyst If they deliver cars on time this year the stock rerates from bankruptcy risk to luxury brand . High risk massive potential upside . 4 . Fluor $ FLR Thesis Fluor has derisked its backlog 82 % of its contracts are now reimbursable meaning the client pays for cost overruns not_Fluor . They are the ones actually building the data centers for hyperscalers and have a massive footprint in the NuclearSMR renaissance . 2026 Catalyst Aggressive share buybacks continuing through Feb 2026 and the monetization of their NuScale SMR stake . 5 . L3Harris $ LHX Thesis Unlike the slowmoving metal benders LockheedNorthrop LHX focuses on the highgrowth tech layer of defense space cyber and comms . They are the trusted disruptor in a sector seeing increased budget allocation . 2026 Catalyst The planned spinoff of their Missile Solutions unit later in 2026 . This unlocks shareholder value and leaves a leaner highermargin tech core . 6 . Capital One $ COF Thesis The play is the Discover acquisition . By owning the Discover network COF creates a closedloop system issuer network that lets them bypass VisaMastercard fees and capture the entire transaction margin . Even without it it ’ s a techforward bank trading at a value multiple . 10 % CC Cap Highly Unlikely to go through 2026 Catalyst Realizing the projected $ 2.7B in synergies . 7 . NextEra Energy $ NEE Thesis AI Data centers consume an insane amount of electricity . NextEra is the largest renewable developer in the US and the only one with the scale 30GW backlog to power the AI boom . You get the safety of a regulated utility Florida Power Light attached to a highgrowth tech play . 2026 Catalyst Confirmed 10 % dividend growth through 2026 and massive demand from hyperscalers GoogleMicrosoft signing longterm power purchase agreements ."

      "selftext": "I’m not usually a metals investor. I mostly stick to equities, ETFs, and some crypto. But given the current political and macro backdrop, I’m starting to question whether ignoring gold and silver right now is actually the bigger risk. Gold and silver have been in a very strong uptrend over the past days and weeks. Gold is trading around $4,675–$4,690/oz, up roughly +1.8% to +1.9% today, while silver is near $94/oz, up +5% to +6.6% today. Silver has been especially volatile, up about +25% YTD (2026) and roughly +200% over the past year. From a macro perspective, this looks like a classic **safe-haven rally**, driven by several overlapping factors: * **Geopolitical tensions**: renewed trade-war risks, US–Europe tariff threats, and broader instability are pushing investors toward defensive assets. * **Macro uncertainty**: a weaker US dollar, uncertainty around Fed leadership and rate cuts, persistent inflation, and rising global debt levels. * **Central bank behavior**: continued strong gold purchases, especially from China, as part of reserve diversification. * **Silver-specific dynamics**: rising industrial demand (electrification, AI infrastructure, crypto-related hardware), structural supply deficits, export restrictions, and its classification as a critical mineral in the US. Some analysts (Citi, JPMorgan) are talking about **$5,000 gold** and **$100 silver** into 2026, though that obviously comes with downside risks. A pullback from profit-taking seems very possible after such a sharp move, even if the broader trend remains bullish. I’m personally conflicted. On one hand, this feels late in the move. On the other, if the political and macro situation deteriorates further, not having any exposure to precious metals could be a blind spot in my portfolio. I’m not looking at physical metals, but rather trading exposure, which makes it easier to follow institutional flows and manage risk. That said, I’m aware metals behave very differently from equities and crypto. Even crypto platforms, Bitget, for example, now offer gold and silver trading through their TradFi products, which I’ve already tested from a trading perspective. Execution is fast and fees are low. However, this time I’m clearly talking about investing rather than short-term trading, which is why I’m approaching it differently. Curious to hear how others here are thinking about this: * Are gold and silver still effective hedges at these levels? * Is this a structural shift, or just a crowded trade waiting for a correction? * How (if at all) are you integrating metals into a portfolio that’s otherwise equity-heavy? Not looking for predictions, just thoughtful perspectives.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m not_usually a metals investor . I mostly stick to equities ETFs and some crypto . But given the current political and macro backdrop I ’ m starting to question whether ignoring gold and silver right now is actually the bigger risk . Gold and silver have been in a very strong uptrend over the past days and weeks . Gold is trading around $ 4675– $ 4690oz up roughly 1.8 % to 1.9 % today while silver is near $ 94oz up 5 % to 6.6 % today . Silver has been especially volatile up about 25 % YTD 2026 and roughly 200 % over the past year . From a macro perspective this looks like a classic safehaven rally driven by several overlapping factors Geopolitical tensions renewed tradewar risks US–Europe tariff threats and broader instability are pushing investors toward defensive assets . Macro uncertainty a weaker US dollar uncertainty around Fed leadership and rate cuts persistent inflation and rising global debt levels . Central bank behavior continued strong gold purchases especially from China as part of reserve diversification . Silverspecific dynamics rising industrial demand electrification AI infrastructure cryptorelated hardware structural supply deficits export restrictions and its classification as a critical mineral in the US . Some analysts Citi JPMorgan are talking about $ 5000 gold and $ 100 silver into 2026 though that obviously comes with downside risks . A pullback from profittaking seems very possible after such a sharp move even if the broader trend remains bullish . I ’ m personally conflicted . On one hand this feels late in the move . On the other if the political and macro situation deteriorates further not_having any exposure to precious metals could be a blind spot in my portfolio . I ’ m not_looking at physical metals but rather trading exposure which makes it easier to follow institutional flows and manage risk . That said I ’ m aware metals behave very differently from equities and crypto . Even crypto platforms Bitget for example now offer gold and silver trading through their TradFi products which I ’ ve already tested from a trading perspective . Execution is fast and fees are low . However this time I ’ m clearly talking about investing rather than shortterm trading which is why I ’ m approaching it differently . Curious to hear how others here are thinking about this Are gold and silver still effective hedges at these levels Is this a structural shift or just a crowded trade waiting for a correction How if at all are you integrating metals into a portfolio that ’ s otherwise equityheavy Not_looking for predictions just thoughtful perspectives ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been seeing bullish thesis’s for ADBE everywhere. I get it. Adobe is a great company. But ADBE is not a great stock. Most claims I hear are “great earnings” “Growth on sale” “moat + shrinking forward PE” or similar. In his book “The Most Important Thing,” Howard Marks proposes the concept of second-level thinking, which is a more complex analysis compared to first level-thinking, which is a more superficial one. I think there’s a lot of first-level thinking on ADBE in the market right now. A lot of investor price anchoring. And a lot of fixation on accounting profit growth, instead of real compounding growth. I say this because most of the earnings growth is supported by share buybacks and not from increasing cash flow from operations. In FY 21, ADBE had 7.23 Billion in CFO, and repurchased $4.67 Billion common stock. In FY 25, adobe had $10 Billion in CFO and $12 Billion in share buybacks. So in a 5 year period, the CFO grew at 8.45% cagr, while the share buybacks grew at 26.61%. But notice that current unearned revenue increased by 0.774 B in 2025. If you do a CFO 4-year cagr that’s adjusted for cash received for services rendered, ADBE’s 4-year cash flow growth is 6.28% Why make this adjustment? Because unearned revenue is extra cash today for future liabilities. (Likely to be 2026 cash flow headwinds) Now to round out my analysis, I calculate the rough cagr of CPI inflation 2021-2025: about 6%. Net these cagr’s: 6.28-6 =0.28% Adjusted for services rendered and inflation 0.28% CFO cagr for ADBE 2021-2025- basically adobe’s CFO is moving in lockstep with inflation Earnings growth had a CAGR of 13.5% roughly, so the PE multiple improvement seems to be exclusively from inflation and buybacks. Since the rate of buyback increase can’t mathematically continue, it’s likely the metrics that justify a higher share price have negative convexity on the horizon. Overall, I’m not saying ADBE is deteriorating, but I am saying most of the reasons people give to forecast a higher share price, are based on deceivingly optimistic metrics.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been seeing bullish thesis ’ s for ADBE everywhere . I get it . Adobe is a great company . But ADBE is not_a great stock . Most claims I hear are “ great earnings ” “ Growth on sale ” “ moat shrinking forward PE ” or similar . In his book “ The Most Important Thing ” Howard Marks proposes the concept of secondlevel thinking which is a more complex analysis compared to first levelthinking which is a more superficial one . I think there ’ s a lot of firstlevel thinking on ADBE in the market right now . A lot of investor price anchoring . And a lot of fixation on accounting profit growth instead of real compounding growth . I say this because most of the earnings growth is supported by share buybacks and not_from increasing cash flow from operations . In FY 21 ADBE had 7.23 Billion in CFO and repurchased $ 4.67 Billion common stock . In FY 25 adobe had $ 10 Billion in CFO and $ 12 Billion in share buybacks . So in a 5 year period the CFO grew at 8.45 % cagr while the share buybacks grew at 26.61 % . But notice that current unearned revenue increased by 0.774 B in 2025 . If you do a CFO 4year cagr that ’ s adjusted for cash received for services rendered ADBE ’ s 4year cash flow growth is 6.28 % Why make this adjustment Because unearned revenue is extra cash today for future liabilities . Likely to be 2026 cash flow headwinds Now to round out my analysis I calculate the rough cagr of CPI inflation 20212025 about 6 % . Net these cagr ’ s 6.286 0.28 % Adjusted for services rendered and inflation 0.28 % CFO cagr for ADBE 20212025 basically adobe ’ s CFO is moving in lockstep with inflation Earnings growth had a CAGR of 13.5 % roughly so the PE multiple improvement seems to be exclusively from inflation and buybacks . Since the rate of buyback increase can ’ t mathematically continue it ’ s likely the metrics that justify a higher share price have negative convexity on the horizon . Overall I ’ m not_saying ADBE is deteriorating but I am saying most of the reasons people give to forecast a higher share price are based on deceivingly optimistic metrics ."

      "selftext": "Hey guys. Extremely new to stocks and Fidelity. My MIL set me up with Primerica when my great grandparents passed and put my inheritance into a Roth IRA through them. Her and her husband were doing Primerica at the time. I didn’t know anything but knew I needed a savings plan. They got out. Just found out last year they weren’t my account managers anymore after leaving. I’m pretty sure they still use Primerica services though. I don’t know anything about stocks as it is so when I found out I was obviously pissed. Made the decision to switch to Fidelity finally. I’ve been wanting to leave Primerica for quite some time because it’s so shady and you can’t control or see anything yourself really without going through someone. Anyways, now I’m with Fidelity. I had asked before on r/personalfinance what to do and I remember them telling me my money will be in stocks that are basically crap. High expense ratio funds owned by Primerica. This is what shows on my account that I own: ACGIX VAFAX SMEAX AIIEX ASIAX When I asked for advice on r/personalfinance they told me to sell what I was in and build a 3 fund portfolio. Like VTI VXUS BND or VT and BND. I honestly have no idea what to do or what most of this means. I did read about the ones I own now and they’re not good is what I’m gathering? Sorry to sound so inept on this topic. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I was going to call Fidelity and have them help me but I don’t even know what to say or ask. I also need to withdraw some of my money to pay off credit cards. Recently pregnant and going to stop working and we can’t take on the debt with one paycheck. If it helps I’m also 33 years old if this makes a difference for anything above. Thank you all. Edit: clarification",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey guys . Extremely new to stocks and Fidelity . My MIL set me up with Primerica when my great grandparents passed and put my inheritance into a Roth IRA through them . Her and her husband were doing Primerica at the time . I didn ’ t know anything but knew I needed a savings plan . They got out . Just found out last year they weren ’ t my account managers anymore after leaving . I ’ m pretty sure they still use Primerica services though . I don ’ t know anything about stocks as it is so when I found out I was obviously pissed . Made the decision to switch to Fidelity finally . I ’ ve been wanting to leave Primerica for quite some time because it ’ s so shady and you can ’ t control or see anything yourself really without going through someone . Anyways now I ’ m with Fidelity . I had asked before on rpersonalfinance what to do and I remember them telling me my money will be in stocks that are basically crap . High expense ratio funds owned by Primerica . This is what shows on my account that I own ACGIX VAFAX SMEAX AIIEX ASIAX When I asked for advice on rpersonalfinance they told me to sell what I was in and build a 3 fund portfolio . Like VTI VXUS BND or VT and BND . I honestly have no_idea what to do or what most of this means . I did read about the ones I own now and they ’ re not_good is what I ’ m gathering Sorry to sound so inept on this topic . I genuinely don ’ t know what to do . I was going to call Fidelity and have them help me but I don ’ t even know what to say or ask . I also need to withdraw some of my money to pay off credit cards . Recently pregnant and going to stop working and we can ’ t take on the debt with one paycheck . If it helps I ’ m also 33 years old if this makes a difference for anything above . Thank you all . Edit clarification"

      "selftext": "Whatever your view of his moves – and it is striking how ostensibly market-friendly capitalists can either overlook this extraordinary level of government intervention, or even enthusiastically welcome it – one thing is clear: Trump knows how to command global attention. Equally striking is how little markets seem to care. Despite the barrage of policy shocks, the S&P 500 has risen 3.3 per cent over the past month, while the ASX 200 has outperformed with a 3.7 per cent gain. That strength reflects Australia’s exposure to booming commodity markets, where surging gold and silver prices, along with another jump in copper, have driven solid gains for resources stocks. Are investors unusually foresighted, or simply complacent? Macquarie strategist Viktor Shvets argues it’s largely the latter, noting that investors are notoriously poor at pricing political and geopolitical risk. [ [",

Equally striking is how little markets seem to care . Despite the barrage of policy shocks the SP 500 has risen 3.3 per cent over the past month while the ASX 200 has outperformed with a 3.7 per cent gain . That strength reflects Australia ’ s exposure to booming commodity markets where surging gold and silver prices along with another jump in copper have driven solid gains for resources stocks .

Allowing allocations to drift can improve returns but increases concentration risk, while frequent rebalancing may reduce momentum and create tax or transaction friction. I’m curious how others approach this balance in practice. Do you follow strict calendar-based rules, percentage thresholds, or allow significant drift before acting ? How do you weigh risk control against return drag during long bull cycles.?",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, As you probably know, Jerome Powell is expected to step down from the Fed at the end of May. Over the last few months, Trump has been pushing hard for interest rate cuts, but Powell has held off, mainly because the US job market is still fairly strong and inflation remains a bit too high. Once Powell leaves, Trump will be the one appointing his replacement, and it seems reasonable to assume that a Fed chair chosen by Trump might be more open to cutting rates. Rate cuts usually make borrowing cheaper for companies, which can boost hiring and speed up economic activity, in simple terms, that’s generally good for the S&P 500. On the flip side, they also tend to push inflation higher and often weaken the dollar against the euro. Given this, do you think it makes sense to switch from a euro-denominated S&P 500 index fund to a currency-hedged one? For anyone who hasn’t really felt the impact of dollar weakness, just look at the numbers: over the last year, the S&P 500 is up about 17% in USD, but only around 4% in EUR. I'm Portuguese and that's why don't want it in dollars.",

      "title": "Volume III: Greenland & The Inevitable - Why Uranium Rare Earths and Strategic Materials Are About to Break the Market",
      "selftext": "Alright, I am back with Volume III. If you listened to me in late December, you should now be up around 45% YTD holding long. Here is my next piece as we continue to track global events and the rare earths bananza continues to take hold: —— **My portfolio (UUUU, MP, CCJ, LYC, LEU)** is not a bet on higher spot prices. It is a bet on physical bottlenecks colliding with geopolitics, energy security, and capital rotation. The market is still underestimating how violent that collision will be. The desire for Greenland is not reckless, it was inevitable. It is the visible phase of a transition that was locked in years ago…. We are entering a period where governments and utilities will pay whatever they must to secure supply of rare earths and materials. When that happens equity repricing does not happen gradually. It happens all at once. Like a fucking Hurricane. **The Macro Thesis** I. Energy security has replaced cost efficiency. II. China’s dominance is now politically intolerable. III. Supply chains cannot be rebuilt on demand. IV. Demand is inelastic and accelerating. V. Capital is rotating away from over owned growth and toward physical chokepoints. Greenland was the accelerant not the cause. The moment Greenland entered the geopolitical spotlight markets were reminded of a simple truth - just like Venezuela. **The West does not control the materials it needs to function**. That realization does not lead to negotiation. It leads to stockpiling long term contracts and panic bidding. **Why This Was Set in Stone Years Ago China Won Africa** None of this started in Greenland. Greenland is the flashpoint not the origin. The origin was a twenty year strategic campaign where China secured the physical foundation of the global economy while the West assumed markets and interdependence would enable the continuation of their growth and supremacy. Beginning in the early 2000s China made a deliberate choice. Control the inputs not the brands. While the West shut down processing, delayed permits, financialized commodities and treated minerals as cyclical trades, China invested directly in mines, built roads, ports and rail while using state backed capital for long term access to resources. **Africa was the centerpiece.** Across the DRC, Zambia, Namibia, Guinea, Zimbabwe and beyond, China locked up cobalt, copper, lithium, rare earths manganese, and graphite, not through spot markets but through multi decade offtake agreements and state to state deals the West refused to touch (because were politically correct pansies playing a game against realists who understood this mineral war years ago). Once those contracts were signed the game was over. The molecules were spoken for. China now controls the majority of rare earths. We’re fucked and now we’re panicking. **The West’s Mistake and Why It Cannot Be Fixed Quickly** 1). The West assumed supply would always be available. 2). That China would remain a neutral trade partner. 3). That ESG frameworks and markets could replace strategy. By the time policymakers woke up the supply chain had already hardened. You cannot rebuild mines in two years. You cannot rebuild processing in three. You cannot recreate workforce expertise overnight. You cannot manufacture social license on demand. China did not win because it was smarter. It won because it was earlier and planned for the long term future. **What we are watching now is not a transition. It is a forced unwind of a twenty year mistake.** Emergency funding long term contracts, ensuring strategic stockpiles and national security exemptions are all symptoms of the same realization. Time no longer exists. **Why Greenland Changed Everything** Greenland forced the issue into the open. It reminded markets and policymakers that strategic minerals are geographically constrained, that supply chains are political, and that China already made its move. This is not a new arms race. It is the late innings of one that already began. When time disappears price stops mattering. **The Companies and the Bottlenecks They Control (and how to make money from this)** This portfolio (UUUU, MP, CCJ, LYC, & LEU) is not a collection of commodity stocks. *It is a collection of chokepoint owners.* **Energy Fuels** controls one of the only domestic pathways in the United States for converting uranium into usable nuclear fuel and separating rare earth oxides. Mining without processing is irrelevant. Processing is the bottleneck. As supply nationalism accelerates Energy Fuels becomes policy infrastructure not a trade. **Cameco** sits at the center of Western uranium supply. Utilities do not want exposure to geopolitics. They want certainty. Cameco controls scalable politically acceptable supply at the exact moment utilities are pulling contracts forward and locking volumes for decades. This is not price leverage. It is contract leverage. **Centrus** controls enrichment. Mining is step one. Enrichment is the gate. SMRs require HALEU. HALEU barely exists. Russia dominates enrichment and that is no longer acceptable. Centrus is not leveraged to spot uranium. It is leveraged to national security timelines. **MP Materials** controls the only large scale rare earth mine in the United States. No mine means no supply. No supply means no EVs no defense systems no AI hardware. Processing will follow but mining is the choke. **Lynas** is the only meaningful rare earth processor outside China. That single fact makes it irreplaceable. In a real supply crisis Lynas does not compete. It gets allocated. YTD, this portfolio is up 40%. Tomorrow (and for the rest of Q1 and beyond) we should expect another major rally. **Final Thoughts** This is not a meme stock play. This is structural. A Face melting lift off based around our world changing and the minerals needed to ensure it operates. Join the ride!",

      "selftext_processed": "Alright I am back with Volume III . If you listened to me in late December you should now be up around 45 % YTD holding long . Here is my next piece as we continue to track global events and the rare earths bananza continues to take hold —— My portfolio UUUU MP CCJ LYC LEU is not_a bet on higher spot prices . It is a bet on physical bottlenecks colliding with geopolitics energy security and capital rotation . The market is still underestimating how violent that collision will be . The desire for Greenland is not_reckless it was inevitable . It is the visible phase of a transition that was locked in years ago… . We are entering a period where governments and utilities will pay whatever they must to secure supply of rare earths and materials . When that happens equity repricing does not_happen gradually . It happens all at once . Like a fucking Hurricane . The Macro Thesis I . Energy security has replaced cost efficiency . II . China ’ s dominance is now politically intolerable . III . Supply chains can not be rebuilt on demand . IV . Demand is inelastic and accelerating . V. Capital is rotating away from over owned growth and toward physical chokepoints . Greenland was the accelerant not_the cause . The moment Greenland entered the geopolitical spotlight markets were reminded of a simple truth just like Venezuela . The West does not_control the materials it needs to function . That realization does not_lead to negotiation . It leads to stockpiling long term contracts and panic bidding . Why This Was Set in Stone Years Ago China Won Africa None of this started in Greenland . Greenland is the flashpoint not_the origin . The origin was a twenty year strategic campaign where China secured the physical foundation of the global economy while the West assumed markets and interdependence would enable the continuation of their growth and supremacy . Beginning in the early 2000s China made a deliberate choice . Control the inputs not_the brands . While the West shut down processing delayed permits financialized commodities and treated minerals as cyclical trades China invested directly in mines built roads ports and rail while using state backed capital for long term access to resources . Africa was the centerpiece . Across the DRC Zambia Namibia Guinea Zimbabwe and beyond China locked up cobalt copper lithium rare earths manganese and graphite not_through spot markets but through multi decade offtake agreements and state to state deals the West refused to touch because were politically correct pansies playing a game against realists who understood this mineral war years ago . Once those contracts were signed the game was over . The molecules were spoken for . China now controls the majority of rare earths . We ’ re fucked and now we ’ re panicking . The West ’ s Mistake and Why It Can not Be Fixed Quickly 1 . The West assumed supply would always be available . 2 . That China would remain a neutral trade partner . 3 . That ESG frameworks and markets could replace strategy . By the time policymakers woke up the supply chain had already hardened . You can not rebuild mines in two years . You can not rebuild processing in three . You can not recreate workforce expertise overnight . You can not manufacture social license on demand . China did not_win because it was smarter . It won because it was earlier and planned for the long term future . What we are watching now is not_a transition . It is a forced unwind of a twenty year mistake . Emergency funding long term contracts ensuring strategic stockpiles and national security exemptions are all symptoms of the same realization . Time no_longer exists . Why Greenland Changed Everything Greenland forced the issue into the open . It reminded markets and policymakers that strategic minerals are geographically constrained that supply chains are political and that China already made its move . This is not_a new arms race . It is the late innings of one that already began . When time disappears price stops mattering . The Companies and the Bottlenecks They Control and how to make money from this This portfolio UUUU MP CCJ LYC LEU is not_a collection of commodity stocks . It is a collection of chokepoint owners . Energy Fuels controls one of the only domestic pathways in the United States for converting uranium into usable nuclear fuel and separating rare earth oxides . Mining without processing is irrelevant . Processing is the bottleneck . As supply nationalism accelerates Energy Fuels becomes policy infrastructure not_a trade . Cameco sits at the center of Western uranium supply . Utilities do not_want exposure to geopolitics . They want certainty . Cameco controls scalable politically acceptable supply at the exact moment utilities are pulling contracts forward and locking volumes for decades . This is not_price leverage . It is contract leverage . Centrus controls enrichment . Mining is step one . Enrichment is the gate . SMRs require HALEU . HALEU barely exists . Russia dominates enrichment and that is no_longer acceptable . Centrus is not_leveraged to spot uranium . It is leveraged to national security timelines . MP Materials controls the only large scale rare earth mine in the United States . No_mine means no_supply . No_supply means no_EVs no_defense systems no_AI hardware . Processing will follow but mining is the choke . Lynas is the only meaningful rare earth processor outside China . That single fact makes it irreplaceable . In a real supply crisis Lynas does not_compete . It gets allocated . YTD this portfolio is up 40 % . Tomorrow and for the rest of Q1 and beyond we should expect another major rally . Final Thoughts This is not_a meme stock play . This is structural . A Face melting lift off based around our world changing and the minerals needed to ensure it operates . Join the ride"

Acquirer is similar to Constellation Software.| |Managed Portfolio|1.1M|I've been working with the person who manages it for 5 years, I trust them and I like their strategy.| |ETFs|1.3M|60% S&P (Voo), 25% outside US (VEA), 15% emerging markets (VWO)| |Bonds|400k|Liquid quickly sellable bonds - should act as a cash reserve.| |Properties|1M|In different locations| I’m currently staying with my company and will have a salary, so don’t plan to withdraw any money.

      "selftext": "I’m 28M and currently maxing out my Traditional 401k and fully utilizing my company's Mega Backdoor Roth (MBDR) (so $72,000 a year). I’m looking to optimize my asset location. Right now, I’m basically mirroring my allocation in both (mostly total market/S&P 500), but I’m considering if I should be more intentional about which assets sit in which tax bucket. The Question: For those with significant balances in both Traditional and Roth, how do you split your holdings? Roth priority: Do you put your highest-growth/highest-risk assets here (e.g., Small Cap Value, Emerging Markets) to maximize tax-free growth? Traditional priority: Do you keep the \"steadier\" stuff here (e.g., S&P 500, Bonds) to mitigate the future tax bill? Or do you just keep the same allocation across all accounts for simplicity? My current thoughts: I'm leaning toward putting my Small Cap tilt in the Roth side and keeping the core S&P 500 in Traditional. I have a 30+ year horizon, so I want to be aggressive, but I’m curious if I'm overthinking the \"tax drag\" vs. the simplicity of mirroring. What’s your strategy and why?",

      "title": "Black Swan | The Greenland Gambit: Why Novo Nordisk (NVO) is the Ultimate Geopolitical Pawn | Denmark's Crown Jewel on US Entity Black List",
      "selftext": "# Section 1: The Arctic Standoff and the \"Novo Nordisk Risk\" In the early weeks of 2026, the frozen landscape of the Arctic has transformed into the most volatile theater in global geopolitics. What began as the \"Greenland Crisis\" has rapidly escalated from a diplomatic curiosity into a full-blown transatlantic fracture. At the epicenter of this dispute is a renewed, aggressive demand from Washington for the United States to purchase Greenland. This is a proposition the Danish government has repeatedly, and perhaps fatefully, characterized as \"absurd.\" # The Greenland-Denmark Nexus To understand the stakes, one must look at the structural ties binding the North Atlantic. While Greenland is a self-governing, autonomous territory, it remains an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark. * Financial Dependency: Copenhagen provides a substantial annual subsidy, known as the block grant, which accounts for roughly half of Greenland’s public budget. * Strategic Leverage: For Denmark, Greenland is not merely territory; it is the bedrock of their status as an Arctic power and their primary source of strategic leverage within the NATO alliance. # The Novo Nordisk Risk However, the true vulnerability of Denmark lies not in its military outposts, but on its balance sheet. We are witnessing a possible \"black swan\" event for the Danish economy centered on a single corporate giant. Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical titan behind the blockbuster GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, has achieved such staggering scale that its market capitalization frequently exceeds Denmark's entire annual GDP. This economic concentration creates a unique geopolitical fragility: * The Pension Anchor: The link to the Danish citizenry is direct and visceral. Danish pension funds, most notably ATP (the nation's largest supplementary provider), are heavily overweight in Novo Nordisk stock. * Retirement Security: As the company’s valuation soared, it became the foundation of Danish retirement security. * The Doom Loop: If Novo Nordisk is targeted, a \"Pension Doom Loop\" begins: a hit to the stock is a direct hit to the future solvency of the Danish middle class. By threatening Novo Nordisk, Washington isn't just targeting a company; it is actively undermining the financial sovereignty of the Danish state to force a hand on the Greenland sale. # Section 2: The Entity List: From Trade Tool to Financial Tactical Nuke To grasp the gravity of a move against Novo Nordisk, one must understand the mechanisms of the Entity List, managed by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). # What is the Entity List? Unlike a standard tariff, which merely increases the cost of a product, the Entity List functions as a technological and commercial blockade. It prohibits U.S. companies from exporting, re-exporting, or transferring specific technologies, software, or components to the listed entity without a specialized license that is notoriously difficult to obtain. # The Huawei Precedent The strategic blueprint for this move was established in 2019 when the Trump administration placed Huawei on the list, citing 5G national security concerns. The impact was surgical: * Supply Chain Strangulation: Huawei was severed from vital U.S. semiconductors and the Google Android ecosystem. * Market Share Collapse: Within two years, their global smartphone business plummeted from the #1 spot to the \"others\" category. * Strategic Containment: It effectively forced global allies to make a binary choice between U.S. technology and Chinese hardware. Applying this logic to Novo Nordisk represents a radical expansion of the \"national security\" definition. If the U.S. declares that \"Danish intransigence in the Arctic poses a threat to U.S. polar security,\" the Entity List becomes the ultimate tool to hold the world’s second most valuable pharmaceutical pipeline hostage until a deal is struck. # Section 3: The $500 Billion Erasure: Why Novo Nordisk Faces an 80% Drawdown This is the \"Doom Scenario\" for NVO shareholders. This would not be a standard market correction; it would be the systematic destruction of equity value. # The 80% Drawdown Thesis In a normal market, a poor earnings report might cause a 10% dip. However, an Entity List designation is a terminal event for a foreign firm dependent on U.S. markets. An 80% collapse is justified by four catastrophic pillars: * Revenue Amputation: Approximately 55% of Novo’s revenue would vanish overnight as the U.S. border effectively slams shut to Ozempic and Wegovy shipments. * The \"Illegal Drug\" Designation: Once on the list, U.S. insurance giants like UnitedHealth and CVS would likely be legally barred from processing payments to a blacklisted entity. The world’s most sought-after medications would be treated as \"contraband\" in their most lucrative market. * Manufacturing Seizure: Novo’s massive production facilities in Clayton, North Carolina, would likely be placed under \"protective custody\" or shuttered by federal mandate. Years of multi-billion dollar CAPEX would be rendered worthless or effectively nationalized. * The Margin Call of a Nation: As the market cap craters, Danish pension funds would be forced into a \"fire sale\" of other assets to cover losses. This would trigger a systemic collapse of the Danish Krone. This isn't just a stock falling; it’s the evaporation of a nation’s balance sheet. The Valuation Reality: When you strip away the \"Growth\" narrative and the \"U.S. Market\" access, Novo Nordisk resets to a European mid-cap with a broken supply chain. The stock would likely regress to 2010 price levels. # Section 4: Supply Chain Choke Points Retaliation: The Silicon Guillotine Brussels will not witness the dismantling of its most valuable firm in silence. If the U.S. executes the \"Novo Option,\" the EU will respond by targeting the one thing the U.S. economy cannot survive without: Semiconductors. # Weaponizing ASML ASML (Netherlands) holds a total, unbreakable monopoly on the EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography machines required to manufacture advanced chips for Nvidia, Apple, and AMD. Without ASML’s cooperation, the \"AI Revolution\" becomes a collection of empty glass buildings. 1. The Service Strike: Bricking the Fabs: The EU’s opening move would be the \"Service Kill-Switch.\" They would mandate that ASML cease all software updates, remote maintenance, and spare part deliveries to \"Hostile Trade Zones.\" This specifically targets the crown jewels of the U.S. CHIPS Act: the new TSMC and Intel fabs in Arizona and Ohio. * The Reality: **These machines are so complex they require constant calibration by Dutch technicians. Without them, U.S. chip manufacturing precision drifts within weeks, yields collapse, and the machines become the world's most expensive paperweights.** 2. The Hard Hardware Ceiling: The \"AI Supercycle\" hits a physical wall. If Nvidia cannot guarantee the next generation of Blackwell or Rubin chips because the machines are \"bricked\" by a Dutch software lock, the supply of compute (the \"oil\" of the 21st century) simply stops flowing. # Section 5: The AI Bubble Collapse: A Trillion-Dollar Reset This is where the geopolitical conflict triggers a generational market wipeout. The U.S. equity market is currently a house of cards built on the assumption of infinite AI growth. The ASML blockade is the gust of wind that brings it all down. # The $5 Trillion Vaporization * The Nvidia Death Spiral: Nvidia’s $3+ trillion valuation is predicated on flawless future growth. When the ASML \"Service Strike\" makes it clear that the next two years of chip supply are physically impossible to build, the stock faces an 80% drawdown. * The Hyperscaler Contagion: Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta have spent hundreds of billions on AI data centers. If the chips to fill them never arrive, that capex becomes \"dead money.\" The \"Mag 7\" lose their growth premium, triggering a rotation out of tech that the rest of the S&P 500 cannot absorb. * The Dot-Com 2.0 Event: In 2000, the bubble took years to deflate. In 2026, with algorithmic trading and \"doom scrolling\" sentiment, $5 trillion in market cap could evaporate in a single week. # Section 6: The Big Tech \"Solidarity Tax\": Seizing Silicon Valley Profits to Save the Danish State With the Danish pension system facing a catastrophic solvency crisis and the \"Silicon Guillotine\" of the ASML blockade already in motion, Brussels is expected to move beyond regulatory friction into the realm of direct financial confiscation. To fund the bailout of the Danish people, the EU will likely pivot toward a radical new fiscal instrument: the Geopolitical Solidarity Tax. # The $50B+ Revenue Seizure Under the emergency framework of the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), the European Commission would designate U.S. \"Mag 7\" giants (specifically Google and Meta) as participants in an \"unfriendly economic blockade.\" * The Escrow Mandate: Instead of traditional multi-year antitrust litigations, the EU would mandate that all advertising and service revenue generated within the Eurozone be paid directly into an EU Sovereign Recovery Fund. * Immediate Liquidity: This provides the EU with an immediate, multi-billion dollar liquidity pool. These funds would be diverted directly to the Danish Central Bank to stabilize the Krone and recapitalize the ATP pension fund, effectively using American corporate profits to social-engineer a fix for the Danish middle class. # The End of Capital Repatriation For investors, the implications are chilling. The era of \"globalized profits\" ends the moment Brussels treats U.S. tech firms as state-owned assets of a hostile power. * The Valuation Trap: If Alphabet and Meta can no longer repatriate billions in quarterly European earnings, their free cash flow models break. * The Precedent: This sets a new global standard: if you are a dominant firm in a foreign market, your balance sheet is a hostage to your home country’s foreign policy. # The \"Digital Iron Curtain\" This taxation strategy and EUVA blockade forces a final, brutal choice for Silicon Valley: comply with the EU’s confiscatory tax to maintain access to 450 million high-value consumers, or pull out of the continent entirely. Most analysts predict a forced compliance and EUVA blockade, leading to a permanent \"Geopolitical Risk Discount\" on U.S. tech stocks that could shave another 40-50% off their terminal value.",

      "selftext_processed": "Section 1 The Arctic Standoff and the Novo Nordisk Risk In the early weeks of 2026 the frozen landscape of the Arctic has transformed into the most volatile theater in global geopolitics . What began as the Greenland Crisis has rapidly escalated from a diplomatic curiosity into a fullblown transatlantic fracture . At the epicenter of this dispute is a renewed aggressive demand from Washington for the United States to purchase Greenland . This is a proposition the Danish government has repeatedly and perhaps fatefully characterized as absurd . The GreenlandDenmark Nexus To understand the stakes one must look at the structural ties binding the North Atlantic . While Greenland is a selfgoverning autonomous territory it remains an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark . Financial Dependency Copenhagen provides a substantial annual subsidy known as the block grant which accounts for roughly half of Greenland ’ s public budget . Strategic Leverage For Denmark Greenland is not_merely territory it is the bedrock of their status as an Arctic power and their primary source of strategic leverage within the NATO alliance . The Novo Nordisk Risk However the true vulnerability of Denmark lies not_in its military outposts but on its balance sheet . We are witnessing a possible black swan event for the Danish economy centered on a single corporate giant . Novo Nordisk the pharmaceutical titan behind the blockbuster GLP1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy has achieved such staggering scale that its market capitalization frequently exceeds Denmarks entire annual GDP . This economic concentration creates a unique geopolitical fragility The Pension Anchor The link to the Danish citizenry is direct and visceral . Danish pension funds most notably ATP the nations largest supplementary provider are heavily overweight in Novo Nordisk stock . Retirement Security As the company ’ s valuation soared it became the foundation of Danish retirement security . The Doom Loop If Novo Nordisk is targeted a Pension Doom Loop begins a hit to the stock is a direct hit to the future solvency of the Danish middle class . By threatening Novo Nordisk Washington isnt just targeting a company it is actively undermining the financial sovereignty of the Danish state to force a hand on the Greenland sale . Section 2 The Entity List From Trade Tool to Financial Tactical Nuke To grasp the gravity of a move against Novo Nordisk one must understand the mechanisms of the Entity List managed by the U.S. Department of Commerce ’ s Bureau of Industry and Security BIS . What is the Entity List Unlike a standard tariff which merely increases the cost of a product the Entity List functions as a technological and commercial blockade . It prohibits U.S. companies from exporting reexporting or transferring specific technologies software or components to the listed entity without a specialized license that is notoriously difficult to obtain . The Huawei Precedent The strategic blueprint for this move was established in 2019 when the Trump administration placed Huawei on the list citing 5G national security concerns . The impact was surgical Supply Chain Strangulation Huawei was severed from vital U.S. semiconductors and the Google Android ecosystem . Market Share Collapse Within two years their global smartphone business plummeted from the 1 spot to the others category . Strategic Containment It effectively forced global allies to make a binary choice between U.S. technology and Chinese hardware . Applying this logic to Novo Nordisk represents a radical expansion of the national security definition . If the U.S. declares that Danish intransigence in the Arctic poses a threat to U.S. polar security the Entity List becomes the ultimate tool to hold the world ’ s second most valuable pharmaceutical pipeline hostage until a deal is struck . Section 3 The $ 500 Billion Erasure Why Novo Nordisk Faces an 80 % Drawdown This is the Doom Scenario for NVO shareholders . This would not_be a standard market correction it would be the systematic destruction of equity value . The 80 % Drawdown Thesis In a normal market a poor earnings report might cause a 10 % dip . However an Entity List designation is a terminal event for a foreign firm dependent on U.S. markets . An 80 % collapse is justified by four catastrophic pillars Revenue Amputation Approximately 55 % of Novo ’ s revenue would vanish overnight as the U.S. border effectively slams shut to Ozempic and Wegovy shipments . The Illegal Drug Designation Once on the list U.S. insurance giants like UnitedHealth and CVS would likely be legally barred from processing payments to a blacklisted entity . The world ’ s most soughtafter medications would be treated as contraband in their most lucrative market . Manufacturing Seizure Novo ’ s massive production facilities in Clayton North Carolina would likely be placed under protective custody or shuttered by federal mandate . Years of multibillion dollar CAPEX would be rendered worthless or effectively nationalized . The Margin Call of a Nation As the market cap craters Danish pension funds would be forced into a fire sale of other assets to cover losses . This would trigger a systemic collapse of the Danish Krone . This isnt just a stock falling it ’ s the evaporation of a nation ’ s balance sheet . The Valuation Reality When you strip away the Growth narrative and the U.S. Market access Novo Nordisk resets to a European midcap with a broken supply chain . The stock would likely regress to 2010 price levels . Section 4 Supply Chain Choke Points Retaliation The Silicon Guillotine Brussels will not_witness the dismantling of its most valuable firm in silence . If the U.S. executes the Novo Option the EU will respond by targeting the one thing the U.S. economy can not survive without Semiconductors . Weaponizing ASML ASML Netherlands holds a total unbreakable monopoly on the EUV Extreme Ultraviolet lithography machines required to manufacture advanced chips for Nvidia Apple and AMD . Without ASML ’ s cooperation the AI Revolution becomes a collection of empty glass buildings . 1 . The Service Strike Bricking the Fabs The EU ’ s opening move would be the Service KillSwitch . They would mandate that ASML cease all software updates remote maintenance and spare part deliveries to Hostile Trade Zones . This specifically targets the crown jewels of the U.S. CHIPS Act the new TSMC and Intel fabs in Arizona and Ohio . The Reality These machines are so complex they require constant calibration by Dutch technicians . Without them U.S. chip manufacturing precision drifts within weeks yields collapse and the machines become the worlds most expensive paperweights . 2 . The Hard Hardware Ceiling The AI Supercycle hits a physical wall . If Nvidia can not guarantee the next generation of Blackwell or Rubin chips because the machines are bricked by a Dutch software lock the supply of compute the oil of the 21st century simply stops flowing . Section 5 The AI Bubble Collapse A TrillionDollar Reset This is where the geopolitical conflict triggers a generational market wipeout . The U.S. equity market is currently a house of cards built on the assumption of infinite AI growth . The ASML blockade is the gust of wind that brings it all down . The $ 5 Trillion Vaporization The Nvidia Death Spiral Nvidia ’ s $ 3 trillion valuation is predicated on flawless future growth . When the ASML Service Strike makes it clear that the next two years of chip supply are physically impossible to build the stock faces an 80 % drawdown . The Hyperscaler Contagion Microsoft Alphabet and Meta have spent hundreds of billions on AI data centers . If the chips to fill them never_arrive that capex becomes dead money . The Mag 7 lose their growth premium triggering a rotation out of tech that the rest of the SP 500 can not absorb . The DotCom 2.0 Event In 2000 the bubble took years to deflate . In 2026 with algorithmic trading and doom scrolling sentiment $ 5 trillion in market cap could evaporate in a single week . Section 6 The Big Tech Solidarity Tax Seizing Silicon Valley Profits to Save the Danish State With the Danish pension system facing a catastrophic solvency crisis and the Silicon Guillotine of the ASML blockade already in motion Brussels is expected to move beyond regulatory friction into the realm of direct financial confiscation . To fund the bailout of the Danish people the EU will likely pivot toward a radical new fiscal instrument the Geopolitical Solidarity Tax . The $ 50B Revenue Seizure Under the emergency framework of the AntiCoercion Instrument ACI the European Commission would designate U.S. Mag 7 giants specifically Google and Meta as participants in an unfriendly economic blockade . The Escrow Mandate Instead of traditional multiyear antitrust litigations the EU would mandate that all advertising and service revenue generated within the Eurozone be paid directly into an EU Sovereign Recovery Fund . Immediate Liquidity This provides the EU with an immediate multibillion dollar liquidity pool . These funds would be diverted directly to the Danish Central Bank to stabilize the Krone and recapitalize the ATP pension fund effectively using American corporate profits to socialengineer a fix for the Danish middle class . The End of Capital Repatriation For investors the implications are chilling . The era of globalized profits ends the moment Brussels treats U.S. tech firms as stateowned assets of a hostile power . The Valuation Trap If Alphabet and Meta can no_longer repatriate billions in quarterly European earnings their free cash flow models break . The Precedent This sets a new global standard if you are a dominant firm in a foreign market your balance sheet is a hostage to your home country ’ s foreign policy . The Digital Iron Curtain This taxation strategy and EUVA blockade forces a final brutal choice for Silicon Valley comply with the EU ’ s confiscatory tax to maintain access to 450 million highvalue consumers or pull out of the continent entirely . Most analysts predict a forced compliance and EUVA blockade leading to a permanent Geopolitical Risk Discount on U.S. tech stocks that could shave another 4050 % off their terminal value ."

      "selftext": "I have been reading the book The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham which I am half way through. I have really enjoyed the 2024 commentary from Jason Zweig. I'm just wondering if people actually read this book and how well it still holds up today. The book talks a lot about bond, which I don't hear a lot about these days - Does anyone here actually invest in bonds? For context, I'm male 30 and new to stock investing. I only started seriously investing half a year ago and have had decent return, but I think it's just because it has been a bull market. Now according to The Intelligent Investor, this is when I should rebalance and put the money I gained from growing stocks back into bond to keep the stock/bond ratio, but I rarely hear anyone talks about bonds around me. But with so many people speculating that the stock market would stop doing well soon, would bonds be a good hedge or should I invest in Berkshire Hathaway or just keep cash? And if bonds, which to buy? Sorry for having too many questions, but which other resources should I consider reading or following on a regular basis? What about the books Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and One Up On Wall Street?",

      "selftext": "Here is DD on an undervalued silver and gold mining stock, CDE: Couer Mining (CDE) is currently trading at 22.6, and is valued at 32.2. I have shares at 18.5 and have been playing calls. I am expecting a BIG gap up on Tuesday so hopefully you guys bought in last week, but it may not be too late! Here is why I like CDE: They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD, a Canadian mining company. Once this merger goes through, they will have 7 operations across North America. They will have the production capability of 900,000oz of gold and 20,000,000oz of silver. They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit. They have had production expansion, like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas. Therefore, they are still growing. They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year. I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026. Their debt is mostly long-term, and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt. The coupon is fixed. I could not find the all-in sustaining cost, but it cost them $248m to sell $554.6m worth of gold and silver. All their mines are considered to be in safe areas; they have 3 in the US, 2 in Mexico, and 1 explorational site in BC. After the merger, they will acquire more sites in Canada. So none of the mines will be politically impacted. They have no active offering; as a matter of fact, they have a $75 million share buyback program valid through May 31, 2026. Their free cash flow is positive, at $188M. One thing to note is that CDE tends to follow the same direction as silver does so only buy CDE if you are bullish on silver!",

I’m not asking if wars cause values to go up or down per se. It’s more about the status of ownership in general. Does it make a difference what broker the assets are held within? Is it generally a unique situation every time? Examples, all assuming the investor is a US citizen, in the US, with a US brokerage, and the US goes to war with the UK. I just picked those 2 countries since it’s easy to find example assets, not because it’s likely they’d go to war. 1. What would happen to shares of BP traded on NYSE, which is a multinational based in the UK? 2. What about shares of an international ETF like VXUS, traded on NASDAQ? (According to some reports, 8.51% of VXUS holdings are in the UK.) 3. Would bonds be any different? (E.g. VTABX, with 8.33% holdings in the UK.)",

      "selftext": "Everyone seems to know feel that valuations are high. J.P. Morgan recently released data showing that when the S&P 500 trades at forward P/E ratios around 22x (where we are now), subsequent 10-year returns have historically ranged between +2% and -2%. For example -> Japan in 1989 was unstoppable and from a period of 15 years (1974 to 1989), the Nikkei 225 had gone up over 10x from 3600 to over 36,000. Then had 30 years of a rollercoaster after 1990 before crossing 36,000 again in 2023. What nobody seems to talk about is what we're supposed to *do* about it. Going through it, the standard options have problems: * **Treasuries**: 4-5% nominal, maybe 1-2% real adjusted for inflation. And then you have to time your re-entry. * **Gold**: Crushed it from 2000-2010 (+15% CAGR) while the S&P was flat (and now). But from 1980-1999, gold returned -6.5% annualized while stocks did +13%. * **International**: \"Cheaper\" for a decade now, but anyone who diversified has underperformed unless they did it last year. Classically it seems like most people take the route of doing nothing. Historically includes a lot of people who waited 10-30 years. The S&P 500 has done something similar in the last 16 years. Going from a low of 677 on March 2009 to 6900+ today in Jan 2026. Also 10x growth within a similar time period. Obviously a lot of what everyone is scared about is the AI bubble. Meanwhile in Japan back in 1989 I looked it up on Reddit and [anecdotes from that time make it sound more insane]( P/E ratios back then were also 60 to 80 for companies. So basically 10 to 30 years of bad returns is not unprecedented. Still Japan at least had deflation / low inflation. I'm curious on how everyone is thinking about potentially hedging.",

I fear that the relation between the US and Europe will continue to deteriorate. And I am scared that this will affect both sides of the Atlantic negatively. What I fear the most is that my stocks will be confiscated at some point down this road of stupidity because I am a non-US citizen holding US stocks. Is this a possibility? If yes, is there a way to protect myself against it, or do I just sell my US stocks? I wish everyone good luck during these crazy times, may the future be one where our leaders can work together for the good of all instead of bullying each other.",

      "selftext": "Looking at the actual revenue split of the biggest US companies, such as the Mag 7. You can argue that they aren't really American companies anymore. They are global utilities that just happen to pay taxes in California. \\- Meta: \\~64% revenue from outside US \\- Apple: \\~64% revenue from outside US \\- Google: \\~56% revenue from outside US The only reason the rest of the world let these companies dominate their economies for 20 years is because the US was seen as the \"stable, boring adult\" in the room. We had high trust. That trust is evaporating. When the US political system looks erratic, foreign governments stop seeing Microsoft or Google as neutral tools. They start seeing them as liability risks from a volatile superpower. The counter-argument is these products are sticky and hard to change. That's true, Corporate IT switching costs are brutal. This isn't going to be a cliff where revenue drops 20% overnight. But change happens on the margins. It's not about losing the current customer. it's about losing the next one. \\- It's the German government choosing a local provider for their next 10-year cloud contract instead of Microsoft. \\- It's France passing laws that force data to stay in-country, destroying margins. \\- It's the Global South adopting Chinese stacks because they don't want to be reliant on US policy whims. This won't be a crash. It will be a slow, painful drag on growth for the next decade. So why has the market been doing well? I think the market was betting heavily that this political chaos is just \"temporary noise\" once Trump is gone everything snaps back to 2015 normalcy, and not pricing in enough of the reverse (for which there is plenty of catalyst such as seemingly never ending political polarization). My argument isn't that we crash tomorrow. It's that we are permanently damaging the infrastructure of trust that allows US tech to print money globally. Trust is hard to build and easy to lose. The market is pricing in \"volatility\" (which passes). It isn't pricing in \"erosion\" (which is long-term).",

      "selftext_processed": "Looking at the actual revenue split of the biggest US companies such as the Mag 7 . You can argue that they arent really American companies anymore . They are global utilities that just happen to pay taxes in California . Meta 64 % revenue from outside US Apple 64 % revenue from outside US Google 56 % revenue from outside US The only reason the rest of the world let these companies dominate their economies for 20 years is because the US was seen as the stable boring adult in the room . We had high trust . That trust is evaporating . When the US political system looks erratic foreign governments stop seeing Microsoft or Google as neutral tools . They start seeing them as liability risks from a volatile superpower . The counterargument is these products are sticky and hard to change . Thats true Corporate IT switching costs are brutal . This isnt going to be a cliff where revenue drops 20 % overnight . But change happens on the margins . Its not_about losing the current customer . its about losing the next one . Its the German government choosing a local provider for their next 10year cloud contract instead of Microsoft . Its France passing laws that force data to stay incountry destroying margins . Its the Global South adopting Chinese stacks because they dont want to be reliant on US policy whims . This wont be a crash . It will be a slow painful drag on growth for the next decade . So why has the market been doing well I think the market was betting heavily that this political chaos is just temporary noise once Trump is gone everything snaps back to 2015 normalcy and not_pricing in enough of the reverse for which there is plenty of catalyst such as seemingly never_ending political polarization . My argument isnt that we crash tomorrow . Its that we are permanently damaging the infrastructure of trust that allows US tech to print money globally . Trust is hard to build and easy to lose . The market is pricing in volatility which passes . It isnt pricing in erosion which is longterm ."

      "selftext": "Trump has said “Starting on February 1st, 2026, all of the above mentioned Countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Finland), will be charged a 10% Tariff on any and all goods sent to the United States of America. On June 1st, 2026, the Tariff will be increased to 25%. This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland. The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years.” The tarrifs should be bullish for gold and silver due to amplifying economic uncertainty and safe haven demand. Metals have already rose due to factors like U.S. China Trade Concerns and policy shifts. Escalating overseas friction could further boost metals as tariffs historically fuel inflation (by raising import costs) and erode confidence in fiat currencies, prompting investors to rotate into gold/silver as a hedge",

The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years. ” The tarrifs should be bullish for gold and silver due to amplifying economic uncertainty and safe haven demand . Metals have already rose due to factors like U.S. China Trade Concerns and policy shifts . Escalating overseas friction could further boost metals as tariffs historically fuel inflation by raising import costs and erode confidence in fiat currencies prompting investors to rotate into goldsilver as a hedge"

      "selftext": "Everyone knows US stocks trade at higher valuations than the rest of the world. The S&P 500 is historically expensive (Shiller PE near 40x). The usual argument is that the US deserves a \"Trust Premium.\" We have the stable government, the reserve currency, and the predictable policy. You pay a luxury tax for US stocks because it's the safe haven. But that trust is evaporating. We are watching the stability of the US erode in real time. With Trump's erratic behavior and policy by tweet, the \"predictable\" part of the US thesis is gone. If the US acts like a volatile emerging market, it shouldn't trade at a safety premium. Why pay 20x or 25x earnings for slow growth US companies when the political risk is skyrocketing? The real asymmetry is abroad. \\- China: You have tech monopolies with actual growth trading at 8x or 9x earnings. \\- South America/Europe: Massive discounts. \\- US: You pay a huge premium for \"safety\" while the political landscape gets more irrational by the day. The valuation gap is closing, and it will continue to close as long as we have the DUmp in the white house. This is why I think looking for \"value\" in the US right now is a mistake. People keep asking if beaten down stocks like PYPL or ADBE are value plays. They aren't. US market will probably continue to be on a relative decline (which has been for the last year) as long as the current policies persists. EDIT: 1. Relative decline means that US market went up significantly less than ex-US markets. Case in point VXUS is up 30% over the last year while VTI is up less than 15%. Taking into account of USD value dropping, US stock market has barely moved up over the last year for many international investors. 2. People are right to point out about MAG7 companies and US still holds a lead technologically and still have the dynamism edge. But looking long term, I think we're coasting on momentum and eating our seed corn. The foundations that built that advantage are eroding: \\- Education is slipping. You can't have tech dominance without a skilled workforce, and we are failing to produce it locally. US math scores in rankings dropped 30th place worldwide. We're relying entirely on importing talent, which Trump is doing his best to discourage. \\- Basic research is drying up. The \"inventing\" part used to be funded by the government (Internet, GPS, early biotech). Federal R&D spend has crashed. Corporations do R&D now, but they focus on next quarter's profit, not the deep science that creates the next industry. We are great at harvesting the crop right now, but we stopped planting the next field.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyone knows US stocks trade at higher valuations than the rest of the world . The SP 500 is historically expensive Shiller PE near 40x . The usual argument is that the US deserves a Trust Premium . We have the stable government the reserve currency and the predictable policy . You pay a luxury tax for US stocks because its the safe haven . But that trust is evaporating . We are watching the stability of the US erode in real time . With Trumps erratic behavior and policy by tweet the predictable part of the US thesis is gone . If the US acts like a volatile emerging market it shouldnt trade at a safety premium . Why pay 20x or 25x earnings for slow growth US companies when the political risk is skyrocketing The real asymmetry is abroad . China You have tech monopolies with actual growth trading at 8x or 9x earnings . South AmericaEurope Massive discounts . US You pay a huge premium for safety while the political landscape gets more irrational by the day . The valuation gap is closing and it will continue to close as long as we have the DUmp in the white house . This is why I think looking for value in the US right now is a mistake . People keep asking if beaten down stocks like PYPL or ADBE are value plays . They arent . US market will probably continue to be on a relative decline which has been for the last year as long as the current policies persists . EDIT 1 . Relative decline means that US market went up significantly less than exUS markets . Case in point VXUS is up 30 % over the last year while VTI is up less than 15 % . Taking into account of USD value dropping US stock market has barely moved up over the last year for many international investors . 2 . People are right to point out about MAG7 companies and US still holds a lead technologically and still have the dynamism edge . But looking long term I think were coasting on momentum and eating our seed corn . The foundations that built that advantage are eroding Education is slipping . You cant have tech dominance without a skilled workforce and we are failing to produce it locally . US math scores in rankings dropped 30th place worldwide . Were relying entirely on importing talent which Trump is doing his best to discourage . Basic research is drying up . The inventing part used to be funded by the government Internet GPS early biotech . Federal RD spend has crashed . Corporations do RD now but they focus on next quarters profit not_the deep science that creates the next industry . We are great at harvesting the crop right now but we stopped planting the next field ."

Not one has dropped them but the stocks down 70 percent. There might not be a good AI program for that ATM with real results and likely won’t have that until at least 2 years. Consider TTD could also be the first to implement and adopt that technology when it works and is proven. Likely they’d just buy that company out. The big note nobody is talking about is what happened in 2024? Elections and huge campaign spending from democrats and republicans who need the best marketing and will pay for it. 2026 is midterm guys, financials will never look better for TTD. They’re going to get more money than they even know what to do with. Back at the end of Jan 2024 TTD bottomed and went up doubled. Were half the price currently that we were even at the bottom in 2024 at 35$ I’m unbelievably bullish on Trade Desk",

Consider TTD could also be the first to implement and adopt that technology when it works and is proven . Likely they ’ d just buy that company out . The big note nobody_is talking about is what happened in 2024 Elections and huge campaign spending from democrats and republicans who need the best marketing and will pay for it . 2026 is midterm guys financials will never_look better for TTD . They ’ re going to get more money than they even know what to do with . Back at the end of Jan 2024 TTD bottomed and went up doubled . Were half the price currently that we were even at the bottom in 2024 at 35 $ I ’ m unbelievably bullish on Trade Desk"

      "selftext": "Just thought I’d share this lesson I was taught in case it helps anyone (been investing 17 years, learned from some pretty smart people along the way). When it comes to news and investing it’s pretty tempting to think a) that big ‘news’ events will affect the market, and b) that you can buy / sell something to benefit and profit from that news. The truth though? It’s doesn’t happen anywhere near as much as we think it does. The way that I think about it is on one extreme you have: - ‘really big news that crashes the market’ and then on the other end you have, - ‘really big news that a lot of people THINK is gonna the market then nothing really happens.’ Now when you really think about it, which of these happens more? It’s definitely the second one. Just think, in the last few months all the chat we’ve had about debt ceiling stuff, Iran nuclear facilities bombings, the Ukraine war, Venezuela, Greenland, investigating the Fed chair, Iran protests, on again, off again tariffs with a dozen different places. And how all of those things were gonna be bad for the market or even crash it. Hasn’t really happened has it? The strategy of successful investors I learned from was to just tune out a lot of that stuff as ‘noise’ cause living in all that noise and trying to react to it all is actually super distracting and not great for your investing. And by investing I mean buying businesses that do their thing well and holding them while they grow their earnings and then their value (market cap, share price) grows with that. If you want to trade day to day news, there’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s basically a coin flip so the odds aren’t with you there.",

      "title": "The Greenland Rug Pull: Nuking the Markets for a Glacier",
      "selftext": "If the administration actually gets to a place where Greenland is up for purchase, how do you all think the markets will react? **1)** They will have to finance this thing somehow. Obviously, they can't just issue pure US debt given the political liability around the debt quantum. Bessent has signaled they could go the path of using a Sovereign Wealth Fund to finance the transaction, likely by stuffing student loans, federal land rights, or other assets and securitizing them out to investors via \"Greenland bonds.\" **2)** Those bonds will have to trade higher than standard US debt given the risk premium and novelty of the structuring (not to mention the depth of the market). Selling, say, $1-2T of these new instruments would flood the market with higher rate debt, driving prices of existing, lower-rate bond portfolios down right off the bat. There goes the bond market. **3)** The higher rates would lead to crowding out, as large institutional investors decide that holding high-rate bonds with a (basically) guaranteed return is worth more than holding equities with less certain returns. Institutional investors would sell off equities to buy larger bond portfolios (this would offset the impact of #2, but not on a 1:1 basis). Equity markets would fall as a result. **4)** The fact that these new pseudo-government bonds would be issued at a higher rate effectively increases the 'risk-free,' i.e., discount rate of the overall economy. If you were evaluating an equity's fundamental value, this increased discount rate would result in the equity being worth less than before. This is a second factor that would push the equity markets down, combined with #3. >**4.1)** The Fed could step in here and perform QE to cap rates, but in any case, this is akin to the US printing money to fund the purchase of Greenland as opposed to financing it. This would just hyper-charge the next point as the Fed creates new money to buy the excess bonds. **5)** Once the funds are raised and the government actually sends out the cash to Denmark/Greenland, it's effectively injected the global economy with $1-2T of debt, strongly raising the likelihood of inflation. Remember it's also pledged what were previously government cash flows to investors (student loans, land rights, etc.), which will create a cash flow hole for the US government that will need to be filled with either taxes, budget cuts, or everyone's favorite, more debt - i.e., more inflation, higher debt-to-GDP ratio, higher rates, and more equity (and likely bond market) depression. >**5.1)** A small, nuanced point, but the way the US will likely need to structure these bonds to make them marketable to investors will require them to retain an equity tranche in the securitization vehicle, which, if priced incorrectly would essentially 'create money,' also driving up money supply and possibly long-term inflation. **6)** Higher rates, greater inflation, and depressed equity/bond markets leaves one trade left for investors, i.e. a debasement trade in hard assets like gold/silver. Of course, gold/silver might crash at first as investors flock to the dollar/sell off for cash (won't get into emerging market dynamics here, but you can guess), but eventually the inflationary effects will get priced in and drive demand for the assets. **Takeaway)** This is highly speculative, and the future is anything but predictable. But the truth is that the US probably doesn't have the firepower to finance this thing, and the fact that any ROI on Greenland would take years to manifest implies there's no way out of buying the island without jacking up rates and inflation (which itself jacks up rates). I think the winning strategy here is all about timing a buy and sell, likely staying out of the capital markets until it becomes apparent that inflation is being priced in, at which point bond markets will have corrected and hard assets like gold/silver should begin to climb. High rates risk Fed action, and even if the Fed does bring rates down, any subsequent QE-induced inflation stands to depress bond/equity valuations in this type of environment. >**Note 1)** I do think a lot of this hinges on the ROI of buying Greenland. If it turns out that the Island can pay for the debt and generate excess returns in a timely manner, i.e., essentially immediately, then perhaps there is no excess inflation from the US printing debt to cap rates/covering cash-flow holes. I do think, though, regardless, the effect of issuing high-rate bonds to pull cash-flows forward and injecting the global economy with that capital has the capacity to trigger this general flow of events. Plus, and ROI from Greenland would take decades, well after the inflation has sunk in. >**Note 2)** There is the possibility that the political crisis this has/will cause a deterioration in trade between the EU and the US, which might limit the effects of a capital injection into the EU on the US economy - but their interlinkage is so strong, I doubt there can ever be a true wall keeping inflation east of the Atlantic.",

      "selftext_processed": "If the administration actually gets to a place where Greenland is up for purchase how do you all think the markets will react 1 They will have to finance this thing somehow . Obviously they cant just issue pure US debt given the political liability around the debt quantum . Bessent has signaled they could go the path of using a Sovereign Wealth Fund to finance the transaction likely by stuffing student loans federal land rights or other assets and securitizing them out to investors via Greenland bonds . 2 Those bonds will have to trade higher than standard US debt given the risk premium and novelty of the structuring not to mention the depth of the market . Selling say $ 12T of these new instruments would flood the market with higher rate debt driving prices of existing lowerrate bond portfolios down right off the bat . There goes the bond market . 3 The higher rates would lead to crowding out as large institutional investors decide that holding highrate bonds with a basically guaranteed return is worth more than holding equities with less certain returns . Institutional investors would sell off equities to buy larger bond portfolios this would offset the impact of 2 but not_on a 11 basis . Equity markets would fall as a result . 4 The fact that these new pseudogovernment bonds would be issued at a higher rate effectively increases the riskfree i.e . discount rate of the overall economy . If you were evaluating an equitys fundamental value this increased discount rate would result in the equity being worth less than before . This is a second factor that would push the equity markets down combined with 3 . 4.1 The Fed could step in here and perform QE to cap rates but in any case this is akin to the US printing money to fund the purchase of Greenland as opposed to financing it . This would just hypercharge the next point as the Fed creates new money to buy the excess bonds . 5 Once the funds are raised and the government actually sends out the cash to DenmarkGreenland its effectively injected the global economy with $ 12T of debt strongly raising the likelihood of inflation . Remember its also pledged what were previously government cash flows to investors student loans land rights etc . which will create a cash flow hole for the US government that will need to be filled with either taxes budget cuts or everyones favorite more debt i.e . more inflation higher debttoGDP ratio higher rates and more equity and likely bond market depression . 5.1 A small nuanced point but the way the US will likely need to structure these bonds to make them marketable to investors will require them to retain an equity tranche in the securitization vehicle which if priced incorrectly would essentially create money also driving up money supply and possibly longterm inflation . 6 Higher rates greater inflation and depressed equitybond markets leaves one trade left for investors i.e . a debasement trade in hard assets like goldsilver . Of course goldsilver might crash at first as investors flock to the dollarsell off for cash wont get into emerging market dynamics here but you can guess but eventually the inflationary effects will get priced in and drive demand for the assets . Takeaway This is highly speculative and the future is anything but predictable . But the truth is that the US probably doesnt have the firepower to finance this thing and the fact that any ROI on Greenland would take years to manifest implies theres no_way out of buying the island without jacking up rates and inflation which itself jacks up rates . I think the winning strategy here is all about timing a buy and sell likely staying out of the capital markets until it becomes apparent that inflation is being priced in at which point bond markets will have corrected and hard assets like goldsilver should begin to climb . High rates risk Fed action and even if the Fed does bring rates down any subsequent QEinduced inflation stands to depress bondequity valuations in this type of environment . Note 1 I do think a lot of this hinges on the ROI of buying Greenland . If it turns out that the Island can pay for the debt and generate excess returns in a timely manner i.e . essentially immediately then perhaps there is no_excess inflation from the US printing debt to cap ratescovering cashflow holes . I do think though regardless the effect of issuing highrate bonds to pull cashflows forward and injecting the global economy with that capital has the capacity to trigger this general flow of events . Plus and ROI from Greenland would take decades well after the inflation has sunk in . Note 2 There is the possibility that the political crisis this haswill cause a deterioration in trade between the EU and the US which might limit the effects of a capital injection into the EU on the US economy but their interlinkage is so strong I doubt there can ever be a true wall keeping inflation east of the Atlantic ."

      "selftext": "This is a high-level qualitative analysis, approached with a \"don't overthink it\" mindset. Take it as such. 1. **Ride Hailing Monopoly** They have a monopoly on the ride-hailing market in the US. Lyft and taxis are not going away, but they are distant second players. 2. **Technical Lead** The infrastructure for optimal ride hailing is easy to prototype, but takes years of iteration to master. The traveling salesman problem is NP-complete for a reason. 3. **Price Incentives** They can increase their prices by 5 percent, and people will not leave. There is a limit to this, but I believe they are far from it. 4. **Autonomous Vehicle Opportunity** I worked at Waymo between 2020 and 2022. Their mission is to build the world's safest driver. Whether it is Waymo or someone else that nails this technology and drives adoption, Uber is a beneficiary. It compounds on top of the points above and does not take away from them. Even if Tesla or someone else turns on a fleet of robotaxis, I see this as a pie that grows rather than one taken away from Uber. 5. **Valuation** Uber is trading at a P/E of 10 and a valuation of $170B. In today's world, $170B is something people sneeze at. A brief look at their [valuation]( and [key metrics]( shows everything trending in the right direction. 6. **Leadership** Dara Khosrowshahi has been executing and driving, pun intended, the team on every front. Experienced, and balancing the many elements of managing and growing a complex business. No qualms, just trust.",

      "title": "Trump announces he will sue JPMorgan ‘over the next two weeks’ for allegedly ‘DEBANKING’ him",
      "selftext": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he will be suing the investment banking company JPMorgan Chase within “the next two weeks” for allegedly “DEBANKING” him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. Trump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot, effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships. He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation, arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration. Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “debanking” conservatives. JPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons. During the 2024 campaign, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president, but their relationship has since soured. Trump in August went after Dimon’s bank, as well as Bank of America, accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years. Earlier in 2025, the Trump Organization sued Capital One, accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business, which was founded by the president’s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics, following the Capitol attack. The president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon. “A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states, without any verification, that I offered Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post. “Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story,” Trump added in the post. “Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE.” Trump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday, which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year. Dimon took that as a joke, according to the Journal, citing people briefed on the discussion. Dimon, asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he’d take the role, said: \"Absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.” Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon, dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department’s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for whom the bank CEO said he has “enormous respect,” could threaten central bank independence. Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates, with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers. \"It would be very bad for consumers, very bad for the economy,\" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank’s earnings call last Tuesday.",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he will be suing the investment banking company JPMorgan Chase within “ the next two weeks ” for allegedly “ DEBANKING ” him after the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol insurrection . Trump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships . He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration . Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “ debanking ” conservatives . JPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons . During the 2024 campaign JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president but their relationship has since soured . Trump in August went after Dimon ’ s bank as well as Bank of America accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years . Earlier in 2025 the Trump Organization sued Capital One accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business which was founded by the president ’ s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics following the Capitol attack . The president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon . “ A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states without any verification that I offered Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase the job of Fed Chairman . This statement is totally untrue there was never_such an offer ” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post . “ Why wouldn ’ t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not_such an offer was made I would have very quickly told them ‘ NO ’ and that would have been the end of the story ” Trump added in the post . “ Why would I give it to Jamie No_such offer was made there or even thought of either . The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘ fact checking ’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE. ” Trump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year . Dimon took that as a joke according to the Journal citing people briefed on the discussion . Dimon asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he ’ d take the role said Absolutely positively no_chance no_way no_how for any reason. ” Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department ’ s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell for whom the bank CEO said he has “ enormous respect ” could threaten central bank independence . Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump ’ s proposal to cap creditcard interest rates with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers . It would be very bad for consumers very bad for the economy JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank ’ s earnings call last Tuesday ."

Not looking for 0DTE or meme lotto tickets, but also not looking for index hugging returns. Goal is to concentrate capital into a small number of quality names where the upside comes from earnings growth or structural tailwinds, not pure multiple expansion hype. Constraints: • Monthly buys, not a lump sum • 5 year horizon • Will tolerate drawdowns, but not full capital wipe risk • No leverage, no options for now Question: What sectors or specific tickers would you actually research today for this bucket, assuming you already have broad market exposure elsewhere? Looking for reasoning, not ticker spam.",

      "selftext": "Alright, so I (based in Europe) have a solid 6 figure amount in individual stocks and ETFs - almost exclusively US tech companies and NASDAQ etc though. And I have been doing well with that. The thing is though: if the US would indeed invade Greenland, it will definitely have devastating consequences on the American economy and Europe would essentially ban American companies from operating in Europe. So I am looking into how I can de-risk my portfolio - happy to hear your opinions on that. Update: Thank you everyone who made reasonable suggestions, it gave me lots of valuable info and there are a few things I will take action on. I have always been one of those \"ride it out\" people, never panicked, always held my stuff and it always paid out in the long run (like for example being up 500% on Alphabet or 1200% on Apple). But I think that IF something happens this time, it will be different. Because it would be a US centered, self-inflicted desaster of the US economy. Yes, it would also hurt the rest of the economy world-wide, but the trust in the US as reliable partner would be gone for decades.",

      "title": "6 Reasons I Believe SNDK Still has room to run",
      "selftext": "&#x200B; Market Cap : 60 Billion Shares Outstanding : 150million Reason 1: Ai Data center and robotics We have a stock which is directly tied to the current market trend of AI Data centers. The current trend is that there is crazy shortages in Memory chips, and Sandisk is one of the companies that creates them. Everything from Robots, cars, data centers all need memory chips to store data. Reason 2: Google Search Trends: Google trends for SNDK worldwide for the last 90 days havent peaked, while the share price is making all time highs DAILY. Even during red market days this shit is barely red or even green. This NEVER happens to pump and dumps. Shitty pump and dumps crash the moment searches on Google drop. look at the graph yourself and compare it to any other pump and dumps you know of. It is also still less popular than the most popular stocks. I can't post links but just search up \"Google Trends\", type in SNDK and put worldwide, 90 days. Reason 3: YouTube streamers and Financial Influencers Search for SNDK on youtube. No hyped up videos from streamers, youtube influencers yet the stock is up 1000%... I get it, its already up so much. So then where are all the reddit ai bots and videos trying to hype it up? Whenever you see those bots trying to pump up the stock, thats your cue to sell yesterday. For SNDK, there's none of that so far. This makes me believe that it was all institutions quietly buying it at first, before all the retail traders. Reason 4: Analyst Price Targets You'll never see analyst price targets for shitty pump and dumps. Most updated price targets from investing firms: Mizuho: $410 when the stock was only at $300 Bernstein: $580 when it was trading at $350 RBC Capital: $400 when it was at $380 Mizuho: $700Billion in Assets under management Bernstein: $900Billion in Assets under management BC Capital: $1 Trillion in Assets under Management. These are serious predictions, not some guys in a mom's basement Reason 5: It is TINY compared to other companies 150m shares outstanding means it can move FAST compared to many other companies in the sector Micron (MU) 1.1Billion shares. Market Cap: 380Billion ASTS: 280 million shares Nvidia (NVDA) 24 Billion Shares, Market Cap: 4.5T SNDK? 150million and 60Billion Market cap. Absolutely tiny compared. Reason 6: Extended Momentum Just look at the graph, this has been pumping forever. Not 1 or 2 days, Or weeks, or months. its been pumping since IPO. That is all, good luck Positions: Feb 27 500c",

The current trend is that there is crazy shortages in Memory chips and Sandisk is one of the companies that creates them . Everything from Robots cars data centers all need memory chips to store data . Reason 2 Google Search Trends Google trends for SNDK worldwide for the last 90 days havent peaked while the share price is making all time highs DAILY . Even during red market days this shit is barely red or even green . This NEVER_happens to pump and dumps . Shitty pump and dumps crash the moment searches on Google drop . look at the graph yourself and compare it to any other pump and dumps you know of . It is also still less popular than the most popular stocks . I cant post links but just search up Google Trends type in SNDK and put worldwide 90 days . Reason 3 YouTube streamers and Financial Influencers Search for SNDK on youtube . No_hyped up videos from streamers youtube influencers yet the stock is up 1000 % ... I get it its already up so much . So then where are all the reddit ai bots and videos trying to hype it up Whenever you see those bots trying to pump up the stock thats your cue to sell yesterday . For SNDK theres none of that so far . This makes me believe that it was all institutions quietly buying it at first before all the retail traders . Reason 4 Analyst Price Targets Youll never_see analyst price targets for shitty pump and dumps . Most updated price targets from investing firms Mizuho $ 410 when the stock was only at $ 300 Bernstein $ 580 when it was trading at $ 350 RBC Capital $ 400 when it was at $ 380 Mizuho $ 700Billion in Assets under management Bernstein $ 900Billion in Assets under management BC Capital $ 1 Trillion in Assets under Management . These are serious predictions not_some guys in a moms basement Reason 5 It is TINY compared to other companies 150m shares outstanding means it can move FAST compared to many other companies in the sector Micron MU 1.1Billion shares . Market Cap 380Billion ASTS 280 million shares Nvidia NVDA 24 Billion Shares Market Cap 4.5T SNDK 150million and 60Billion Market cap . Absolutely tiny compared . Reason 6 Extended Momentum Just look at the graph this has been pumping forever . Not_1 or 2 days Or weeks or months . its been pumping since IPO . That is all good luck Positions Feb 27 500c"

      "selftext": "Alright looking for thoughts here. APP has had multiple PT raises, fundamentals seem fine, but this thing has been an absolute roller coaster the last 6 months, straight up elevators both ways. One thing I’m wondering about is the huge Jan 16 LEAP expiration that just hit. Is it possible some of this dump into expiration was just options mechanics? Dealer hedging, LEAPs getting rolled/unwound, gamma nonsense, etc. Basically price getting pushed around for reasons that have nothing to do with the actual business. I’ve seen other high-beta names get sold into big expirations and then randomly rip once the hedging pressure disappears. Not saying it has to happen here, just wondering if that’s in play. Full disclosure so you can roast me properly: I’m holding 615 calls expiring 1/30. Bought them Thursday, averaged down yesterday. Yes, I hate myself a little. So what do you guys think: Dead cat and more pain incoming? Or classic “dump into opex then bounce after” setup? Not looking for hopium, just want to hear how others are reading this price action.",

APP has had multiple PT raises fundamentals seem fine but this thing has been an absolute roller coaster the last 6 months straight up elevators both ways . One thing I ’ m wondering about is the huge Jan 16 LEAP expiration that just hit . Is it possible some of this dump into expiration was just options mechanics Dealer hedging LEAPs getting rolledunwound gamma nonsense etc . Basically price getting pushed around for reasons that have nothing_to do with the actual business . I ’ ve seen other highbeta names get sold into big expirations and then randomly rip once the hedging pressure disappears . Not_saying it has to happen here just wondering if that ’ s in play . Full disclosure so you can roast me properly I ’ m holding 615 calls expiring 130 . Bought them Thursday averaged down yesterday . Yes I hate myself a little . So what do you guys think Dead cat and more pain incoming Or classic “ dump into opex then bounce after ” setup Not_looking for hopium just want to hear how others are reading this price action ."

I’ve been getting emails about them changing the margin rates to 5% or lower just depends how much margin you use. It sounds like a good deal just use margin to invest in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq and low risk ETFs and you’ll outperform it in the long run. And a bunch of people are saying margin is risky and you shouldn’t use it. I plan on using like 20-25% of the available margin to invest in ETFs because I’ll have cash on the side just in case there’s a bear market and I know there’s a chance to get margin call. Am I missing something that I should be aware of why this is a bad deal?",

Everyone seems extremely bullish with everyone sharing their YTD returns in high beta stocks. This transition from november/december to 2026 doesnt made sense to me.. So i wanted to ask, if a rug pull can eventually happen while everyone turns bullish all of a sudden? Does this ever happen in the markets, a market maker eventually creating fomo with all these high beta names to creatr bagholders. I know it is impossible to call the top, just want to hear your opinions. The transition as i said from december to 2026 felt super weird to me. Thanks.",

      "selftext": "\"Discord JUST filed for IPO - they're betting on a $15B+ valuation 🤯 Here’s what we know so far: → 200M+ monthly active users → Valued at $15B in its last funding round (2021) → $600M+ in annual revenue (estimated) → $500M raised in their last funding round Discord started as a gaming chat app in 2015. Today, they host communities for everything: beatboxing, investing, AI, crypto, you name it. Back in 2021, Discord rejected a $12B offer from Microsoft. Now, they’re going public, aiming for even higher valuation. Here's what makes Discord different: They’ve built a $600M+ business mostly without ads - something nearly unheard of at this scale. While Meta, X, and TikTok are 90%+ ad-driven, Discord's core model is: \\- Nitro subscriptions ($9.99/mo) \\- Server boosts \\- Game distribution fees They only introduced \"Quests\" (sponsored challenges) in 2024, years after hitting massive scale. Most platforms start with ads but Discord added them as a bonus, not a crutch. The timing makes sense too. After a 3-year IPO freeze, the market is finally warming up. Tech IPOs raised $15.6B last year - double the year before - and Discord is riding that momentum! If they go public anywhere near their $15B valuation, it’s a major validation of a subscription-first monetization model for social platforms. It shows you don’t have to run ads to build a billion-dollar consumer business.\" ( i found this post) What do you think is a good evaluation to buy it when it launches? We know Discord has no competition in gaming and , if we bet that they will go against Teams for businesses, they can get a high market for business meeting apps.",

      "selftext_processed": "Discord JUST filed for IPO theyre betting on a $ 15B valuation 🤯 Here ’ s what we know so far → 200M monthly active users → Valued at $ 15B in its last funding round 2021 → $ 600M in annual revenue estimated → $ 500M raised in their last funding round Discord started as a gaming chat app in 2015 . Today they host communities for everything beatboxing investing AI crypto you name it . Back in 2021 Discord rejected a $ 12B offer from Microsoft . Now they ’ re going public aiming for even higher valuation . Heres what makes Discord different They ’ ve built a $ 600M business mostly without ads something nearly unheard of at this scale . While Meta X and TikTok are 90 % addriven Discords core model is Nitro subscriptions $ 9.99mo Server boosts Game distribution fees They only introduced Quests sponsored challenges in 2024 years after hitting massive scale . Most platforms start with ads but Discord added them as a bonus not_a crutch . The timing makes sense too . After a 3year IPO freeze the market is finally warming up . Tech IPOs raised $ 15.6B last year double the year before and Discord is riding that momentum If they go public anywhere near their $ 15B valuation it ’ s a major validation of a subscriptionfirst monetization model for social platforms . It shows you don ’ t have to run ads to build a billiondollar consumer business . i found this post What do you think is a good evaluation to buy it when it launches We know Discord has no_competition in gaming and if we bet that they will go against Teams for businesses they can get a high market for business meeting apps ."

      "selftext": "After spending some time drafting this as a comment to a wsb post, i thought Id share my opinion more publicly to you guys. I would like to show and share my appreciation for firefly here, the currently hated and priced for failure rocketlab alternative. if you look at reaaons for past failures, all are easily fixable. They have had successes, indicating their tech works when done right. People shit on them because of idiot Astra ceo comment about their engines, fact is their reaver engines and first stage has 5/6 full success rate (not counting flight 7 test failure) , failing only on flight 1 due to a loose wire. Astra is a failed company that couldnt even get a rocket 1/10 the size of alpha into orbit and the failed ceo is just trying to shift blame. The fact that Northtrop is literally betting their future of their Antares on firefly supports this, as well as their 50 mil invesment in May 2025. Regarding the founder Tom, while probably not on Peter Beck absolute genius level, has a deeply technical background, ivy league phd, with experience from working at most major adrospace companies in deeply technical roles and rising through the engineering ranks. Recent management changes point to improvements in the human element. Transitioning to block 2 for mass manufacturing + moving to in house parts indicates moving in the right direction. Their lunar lander is only matched by intuitve machines, literally a duopoly in the medium term. Scitec + elytra = huge diversification and revenue potential MLV vehicle almost same timing as rklb neutron, probably by end 2026 or early 2027. Market has priced them for failure but if they can show success this year, it will massively rerate to rklb style valuation. Theres speculation they will merge with redwire once their alpha is more proven and stock price is up. Fly and redwire share the same majority owner. This would literally create a new space giant with full vertical integration that everyone else has to buy from. I fully agree RKLB is the better company, but after the 20x runup, it is fully valued. Fly as the runner up priced for failure has 10x potential if execution is right. I have gotten downvotes here for supporting firefly from people who \"have worked there and wouldnt touch it with a pole\" or they point to failed astra ceo comments, but no negative comments can actually back up their negative sentiment with facts. I believe fly is massively undervalued. It was a damn steal at 20, still is at these price levels. The explosion in september gave a huge buying opportunity and the buying window at these levels will forever close IF flight 7 goes well. If not, just another buying oportunity.",

      "selftext_processed": "After spending some time drafting this as a comment to a wsb post i thought Id share my opinion more publicly to you guys . I would like to show and share my appreciation for firefly here the currently hated and priced for failure rocketlab alternative . if you look at reaaons for past failures all are easily fixable . They have had successes indicating their tech works when done right . People shit on them because of idiot Astra ceo comment about their engines fact is their reaver engines and first stage has 56 full success rate not counting flight 7 test failure failing only on flight 1 due to a loose wire . Astra is a failed company that couldnt even get a rocket 110 the size of alpha into orbit and the failed ceo is just trying to shift blame . The fact that Northtrop is literally betting their future of their Antares on firefly supports this as well as their 50 mil invesment in May 2025 . Regarding the founder Tom while probably not_on Peter Beck absolute genius level has a deeply technical background ivy league phd with experience from working at most major adrospace companies in deeply technical roles and rising through the engineering ranks . Recent management changes point to improvements in the human element . Transitioning to block 2 for mass manufacturing moving to in house parts indicates moving in the right direction . Their lunar lander is only matched by intuitve machines literally a duopoly in the medium term . Scitec elytra huge diversification and revenue potential MLV vehicle almost same timing as rklb neutron probably by end 2026 or early 2027 . Market has priced them for failure but if they can show success this year it will massively rerate to rklb style valuation . Theres speculation they will merge with redwire once their alpha is more proven and stock price is up . Fly and redwire share the same majority owner . This would literally create a new space giant with full vertical integration that everyone else has to buy from . I fully agree RKLB is the better company but after the 20x runup it is fully valued . Fly as the runner up priced for failure has 10x potential if execution is right . I have gotten downvotes here for supporting firefly from people who have worked there and wouldnt touch it with a pole or they point to failed astra ceo comments but no_negative comments can actually back up their negative sentiment with facts . I believe fly is massively undervalued . It was a damn steal at 20 still is at these price levels . The explosion in september gave a huge buying opportunity and the buying window at these levels will forever close IF flight 7 goes well . If not_just another buying oportunity ."

      "selftext": "In a recent thread on r/ETFs, I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international (and other asset classes) from Testfolio. In brief, US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents, both on a nominal and an excess (above risk-free rate) basis, a phenomenon known as [\"the presidential puzzle\"]( However, correlation is not causation, and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of time-varying risk aversion. # Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests. Details for the data sources are [documented](#backtest): * SPYSIM: Mimics S&P 500. Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928, then Schwert S&P 500 composite portfolio through 1962, then S&P 500 price index through 1993, then SPY thereafter. * VTISIM: Total US stock market, based on Fama-French dataset from 1926-1992, then investible mutual funds/ETFs afterwards * VXUSSIM: International ex-US stock market, based on MSCI World ex-USA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996, then investible mutual funds afterwards. * VTSIM: Global. VTISIM/VXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008, then VT afterwards. * GLDSIM: Spot gold, based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004, then GLD afterwards. * TBILL: Fama-French Rf from 1926-1954, then 3-month T-bill rate thereafter. * IEFSIM: 10-year US treasury rate from 1962-2002, then IEF thereafter. * INFLATION: Unadjusted CPI-U. Additionally, to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent, I \"staggered\" the investment period by starting and ending it on \"Inauguration Day\" rather than \"New Year's Day\". Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937; prior to 1937, Inauguration Day was March 4, and this is reflected accordingly in the \"staggered years\". As such, 1973 refers to the period from 1973-01-20 to 1974-01-20. (Note also that this does not double-count January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio \"invests\" at the close of the starting day for each period.) A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post. # US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities, \"cash\" (risk-free treasuries), and inflation going back to 1926, with the Fama-French Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1926-present)|99.56|\\+10.28%|\\+10.23%|\\+3.33%|\\+2.95%| |Republican|47.68|\\+6.58%|\\+6.33%|\\+4.34%|\\+2.22%| |Democratic|51.88|\\+13.80%|\\+13.95%|\\+2.42%|\\+3.63%| |Post-Depression (1940-present)|86.00|\\+11.49%|\\+11.47%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.71%| |Republican|41.00|\\+9.07%|\\+8.96%|\\+4.69%|\\+3.43%| |Democratic|45.00|\\+13.74%|\\+13.81%|\\+2.77%|\\+3.97%| Going back to 1926, US equities (+10.28% p.a.) did better under Democratic presidencies (+13.80%) than under Republican ones (+6.58%). However, it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies (+3.63%) than under Republican ones (+2.22%), cash (or short-term treasury bills) paid less (+2.42%) under Democrats than under Republicans (+4.34%). We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression--a terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership, but also a very deflationary one, with subsequent rebound under FDR--by starting our timeline in 1940. In this case, US equities still did better under Democrats (+13.74%) than Republicans (+9.07%), but the inflation gap (+3.97% vs. 3.43%) is closer; short-term treasury bills still paid less under Democrats (+2.77% vs. 4.69%). Regardless of which party was in office, you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal, real, and risk-free premium basis. That is, US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above risk-free treasury bills. # US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962, we have access to IEFSIM, which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002, and then on the IEF ETF (7-10 year treasuries) thereafter. This provides a real investment alternative to cash/t-bills. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1962-present)|64.05|\\+10.52%|\\+10.58%|\\+4.52%|\\+6.01%|\\+3.77%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|31.05|\\+13.78%|\\+14.06%|\\+3.72%|\\+2.98%|\\+3.60%| During this time, US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents (+14.06% vs. +7.39%). Inflation was similar, slightly lower under Democrats (+3.60% vs. +3.92%). Treasuries paid higher under Republicans (+8.94% vs. +2.98%), which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis. In fact, US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents (+8.94% vs. +7.39%). # US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold, which has gained in popularity with its recent surge. This is a useful separate gauge because on balance short-term interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans, both on a nominal and real basis. However, gold provides a \"benchmark\" that is not directly affected by central bank policy. Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard, the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968; Testfolio has data starting on 1968-04-01. Additionally, the US did not formally break from the gold standard until Nixon's announcement on 1971-08-15 marked the end of Bretton Woods. Both timelines are represented here: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1968-present)|57.80|\\+10.81%|\\+10.81%|\\+8.30%|\\+4.58%|\\+6.38%|\\+3.94%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+8.19%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|24.80|\\+15.32%|\\+15.52%|\\+8.44%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.07%|\\+3.97%| |After Bretton Woods (1971-present)|54.43|\\+11.16%|\\+11.17%|\\+8.72%|\\+4.50%|\\+6.49%|\\+3.86%| |Republican|30.43|\\+8.00%|\\+7.98%|\\+9.11%|\\+5.19%|\\+9.23%|\\+3.79%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| This period was also characterized by better equity performance under Democratic presidents (+15.52% vs. +7.39%), with similar levels of inflation (+3.97% D vs. +3.92% R). Gold also performed similarly (+8.44% D vs. +8.19% R) regardless of political party in office. However, US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats (+15.52% vs. +8.44%), but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans (+7.39% vs. +8.19%). A similar (but more pronounced) trend can be seen if using the post-Bretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold. # US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international (ex-US) equities. This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy, because when the FOMC cuts, all else being equal, the dollar weakens relative to other currencies, thereby boosting USD-denominated international returns (and vice versa). Unfortunately, we do not have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices, which initially tracked only developed (MSCI World) markets: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|International|Global|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1970-present)|56.05|\\+11.07%|\\+11.05%|\\+8.88%|\\+10.03%|\\+8.84%|\\+4.54%|\\+6.66%|\\+3.89%| |Republican|32.05|\\+8.01%|\\+7.94%|\\+8.17%|\\+8.05%|\\+9.31%|\\+5.22%|\\+9.39%|\\+3.85%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+9.84%|\\+12.74%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| In 55 years of available data, US equities soundly outperformed international (+11.05% vs. +8.88%). However, outperformance came during Democratic presidencies (+15.35% vs. +9.84%); under Republican presidents, US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts (+7.94% vs. +8.17%). I want to emphasize these do not constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international (and certainly not to pull all your stocks out of the market). Past performance is not an indication of future performance. It is as nonsensical to say \"the US always underperforms under X\" as is to say \"the US will always outperform international\". # Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio. Because these are limited to five \"portfolios\" per backtest, for each year, I've put S&P 500, US, Cash, Treasuries, and Inflation in the \"US\" link and international, global, and gold in the \"gold\" or \"intl\" link. Note that these reflective \"cumulative\" returns for each period. All of these are one year periods with the exception of the following: * 1926: 1926-06-30 to 1927-03-04 due to start of data series * 1936: 1936-03-04 to 1937-01-20 due to change in Inauguration Day (20th Amendment) * 2025: 2025-01-20 to 2026-01-16 (current) * 1961, 1968, 1969: Returns for treasuries^†, gold^‡, and international^§ are based on start of data series as indicated in foot notes below. Note that for the sections above, the \"other\" asset classes are aligned to the same date (i.e. US stock returns for \"After Bretton Woods\" started on 1971-08-15), even though these are not shown in the table below. |Year^\\*|Party|President|S&P|US|Intl|Global|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1926 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|10.19%|13.80%||||1.87%||\\-1.77%| |1927 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|22.85%|26.36%||||2.61%||\\-1.65%| |1928 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|50.86%|46.26%||||3.17%||\\-0.08%| |1929 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-4.14%|\\-10.52%||||3.83%||\\-0.59%| |1930 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-22.54%|\\-26.01%||||1.80%||\\-7.65%| |1931 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-45.92%|\\-46.70%||||1.10%||\\-10.20%| |1932 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-27.51%|\\-25.74%||||0.35%||\\-9.92%| |1933 ([US](|Dem|F.

      "selftext_processed": "In a recent thread on rETFs I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international and other asset classes from Testfolio . In brief US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents both on a nominal and an excess above riskfree rate basis a phenomenon known as the presidential puzzle However correlation is not_causation and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of timevarying risk aversion . Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests . Details for the data sources are documentedbacktest SPYSIM Mimics SP 500 . Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928 then Schwert SP 500 composite portfolio through 1962 then SP 500 price index through 1993 then SPY thereafter . VTISIM Total US stock market based on FamaFrench dataset from 19261992 then investible mutual fundsETFs afterwards VXUSSIM International exUS stock market based on MSCI World exUSA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996 then investible mutual funds afterwards . VTSIM Global . VTISIMVXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008 then VT afterwards . GLDSIM Spot gold based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004 then GLD afterwards . TBILL FamaFrench Rf from 19261954 then 3month Tbill rate thereafter . IEFSIM 10year US treasury rate from 19622002 then IEF thereafter . INFLATION Unadjusted CPIU . Additionally to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent I staggered the investment period by starting and ending it on Inauguration Day rather than New Years Day . Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937 prior to 1937 Inauguration Day was March 4 and this is reflected accordingly in the staggered years . As such 1973 refers to the period from 19730120 to 19740120 . Note also that this does not_doublecount January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio invests at the close of the starting day for each period . A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post . US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities cash riskfree treasuries and inflation going back to 1926 with the FamaFrench Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashInflation Overall 1926present99.5610.28 % 10.23 % 3.33 % 2.95 % Republican47.686.58 % 6.33 % 4.34 % 2.22 % Democratic51.8813.80 % 13.95 % 2.42 % 3.63 % PostDepression 1940present86.0011.49 % 11.47 % 3.68 % 3.71 % Republican41.009.07 % 8.96 % 4.69 % 3.43 % Democratic45.0013.74 % 13.81 % 2.77 % 3.97 % Going back to 1926 US equities 10.28 % p.a . did better under Democratic presidencies 13.80 % than under Republican ones 6.58 % . However it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies 3.63 % than under Republican ones 2.22 % cash or shortterm treasury bills paid less 2.42 % under Democrats than under Republicans 4.34 % . We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depressiona terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership but also a very deflationary one with subsequent rebound under FDRby starting our timeline in 1940 . In this case US equities still did better under Democrats 13.74 % than Republicans 9.07 % but the inflation gap 3.97 % vs. 3.43 % is closer shortterm treasury bills still paid less under Democrats 2.77 % vs. 4.69 % . Regardless of which party was in office you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal real and riskfree premium basis . That is US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above riskfree treasury bills . US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962 we have access to IEFSIM which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002 and then on the IEF ETF 710 year treasuries thereafter . This provides a real investment alternative to cashtbills . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1962present64.0510.52 % 10.58 % 4.52 % 6.01 % 3.77 % Republican33.007.54 % 7.39 % 5.27 % 8.94 % 3.92 % Democratic31.0513.78 % 14.06 % 3.72 % 2.98 % 3.60 % During this time US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents 14.06 % vs. 7.39 % . Inflation was similar slightly lower under Democrats 3.60 % vs. 3.92 % . Treasuries paid higher under Republicans 8.94 % vs. 2.98 % which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis . In fact US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents 8.94 % vs. 7.39 % . US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold which has gained in popularity with its recent surge . This is a useful separate gauge because on balance shortterm interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans both on a nominal and real basis . However gold provides a benchmark that is not_directly affected by central bank policy . Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968 Testfolio has data starting on 19680401 . Additionally the US did not_formally break from the gold standard until Nixons announcement on 19710815 marked the end of Bretton Woods . Both timelines are represented here CAGRYearsSP 500USGoldCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1968present57.8010.81 % 10.81 % 8.30 % 4.58 % 6.38 % 3.94 % Republican33.007.54 % 7.39 % 8.19 % 5.27 % 8.94 % 3.92 % Democratic24.8015.32 % 15.52 % 8.44 % 3.68 % 3.07 % 3.97 % After Bretton Woods 1971present54.4311.16 % 11.17 % 8.72 % 4.50 % 6.49 % 3.86 % Republican30.438.00 % 7.98 % 9.11 % 5.19 % 9.23 % 3.79 % Democratic24.0015.31 % 15.35 % 8.23 % 3.64 % 3.11 % 3.94 % This period was also characterized by better equity performance under Democratic presidents 15.52 % vs. 7.39 % with similar levels of inflation 3.97 % D vs. 3.92 % R. Gold also performed similarly 8.44 % D vs. 8.19 % R regardless of political party in office . However US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats 15.52 % vs. 8.44 % but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans 7.39 % vs. 8.19 % . A similar but more pronounced trend can be seen if using the postBretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold . US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international exUS equities . This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy because when the FOMC cuts all else being equal the dollar weakens relative to other currencies thereby boosting USDdenominated international returns and vice versa . Unfortunately we do not_have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices which initially tracked only developed MSCI World markets CAGRYearsSP 500USInternationalGlobalGoldCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1970present56.0511.07 % 11.05 % 8.88 % 10.03 % 8.84 % 4.54 % 6.66 % 3.89 % Republican32.058.01 % 7.94 % 8.17 % 8.05 % 9.31 % 5.22 % 9.39 % 3.85 % Democratic24.0015.31 % 15.35 % 9.84 % 12.74 % 8.23 % 3.64 % 3.11 % 3.94 % In 55 years of available data US equities soundly outperformed international 11.05 % vs. 8.88 % . However outperformance came during Democratic presidencies 15.35 % vs. 9.84 % under Republican presidents US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts 7.94 % vs. 8.17 % . I want to emphasize these do not_constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international and certainly not_to pull all your stocks out of the market . Past performance is not_an indication of future performance . It is as nonsensical to say the US always underperforms under X as is to say the US will always outperform international . Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio . Because these are limited to five portfolios per backtest for each year Ive put SP 500 US Cash Treasuries and Inflation in the US link and international global and gold in the gold or intl link .

All of these are one year periods with the exception of the following 1926 19260630 to 19270304 due to start of data series 1936 19360304 to 19370120 due to change in Inauguration Day 20th Amendment 2025 20250120 to 20260116 current 1961 1968 1969 Returns for treasuries† gold‡ and international§ are based on start of data series as indicated in foot notes below .

      "selftext": "In a recent thread on r/ETFs, I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international (and other asset classes) from Testfolio. In brief, US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents, both on a nominal and an excess (above risk-free rate) basis, a phenomenon known as [\"the presidential puzzle\"]( However, correlation is not causation, and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of time-varying risk aversion. # Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests. Details for the data sources are [documented](#backtest): * SPYSIM: Mimics S&P 500. Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928, then Schwert S&P 500 composite portfolio through 1962, then S&P 500 price index through 1993, then SPY thereafter. * VTISIM: Total US stock market, based on Fama-French dataset from 1926-1992, then investible mutual funds/ETFs afterwards * VXUSSIM: International ex-US stock market, based on MSCI World ex-USA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996, then investible mutual funds afterwards. * VTSIM: Global. VTISIM/VXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008, then VT afterwards. * GLDSIM: Spot gold, based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004, then GLD afterwards. * TBILL: Fama-French Rf from 1926-1954, then 3-month T-bill rate thereafter. * IEFSIM: 10-year US treasury rate from 1962-2002, then IEF thereafter. * INFLATION: Unadjusted CPI-U. Additionally, to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent, I \"staggered\" the investment period by starting and ending it on \"Inauguration Day\" rather than \"New Year's Day\". Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937; prior to 1937, Inauguration Day was March 4, and this is reflected accordingly in the \"staggered years\". As such, 1973 refers to the period from 1973-01-20 to 1974-01-20. (Note also that this does not double-count January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio \"invests\" at the close of the starting day for each period.) A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post. # US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities, \"cash\" (risk-free treasuries), and inflation going back to 1926, with the Fama-French Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1926-present)|99.56|\\+10.28%|\\+10.23%|\\+3.33%|\\+2.95%| |Republican|47.68|\\+6.58%|\\+6.33%|\\+4.34%|\\+2.22%| |Democratic|51.88|\\+13.80%|\\+13.95%|\\+2.42%|\\+3.63%| |Post-Depression (1940-present)|86.00|\\+11.49%|\\+11.47%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.71%| |Republican|41.00|\\+9.07%|\\+8.96%|\\+4.69%|\\+3.43%| |Democratic|45.00|\\+13.74%|\\+13.81%|\\+2.77%|\\+3.97%| Going back to 1926, US equities (+10.28% p.a.) did better under Democratic presidencies (+13.80%) than under Republican ones (+6.58%). However, it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies (+3.63%) than under Republican ones (+2.22%), cash (or short-term treasury bills) paid less (+2.42%) under Democrats than under Republicans (+4.34%). We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression--a terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership, but also a very deflationary one, with subsequent rebound under FDR--by starting our timeline in 1940. In this case, US equities still did better under Democrats (+13.74%) than Republicans (+9.07%), but the inflation gap (+3.97% vs. 3.43%) is closer; short-term treasury bills still paid less under Democrats (+2.77% vs. 4.69%). Regardless of which party was in office, you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal, real, and risk-free premium basis. That is, US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above risk-free treasury bills. # US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962, we have access to IEFSIM, which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002, and then on the IEF ETF (7-10 year treasuries) thereafter. This provides a real investment alternative to cash/t-bills. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1962-present)|64.05|\\+10.52%|\\+10.58%|\\+4.52%|\\+6.01%|\\+3.77%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|31.05|\\+13.78%|\\+14.06%|\\+3.72%|\\+2.98%|\\+3.60%| During this time, US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents (+14.06% vs. +7.39%). Inflation was similar, slightly lower under Democrats (+3.60% vs. +3.92%). Treasuries paid higher under Republicans (+8.94% vs. +2.98%), which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis. In fact, US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents (+8.94% vs. +7.39%). # US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold, which has gained in popularity with its recent surge. This is a useful separate gauge because on balance short-term interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans, both on a nominal and real basis. However, gold provides a \"benchmark\" that is not directly affected by central bank policy. Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard, the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968; Testfolio has data starting on 1968-04-01. Additionally, the US did not formally break from the gold standard until Nixon's announcement on 1971-08-15 marked the end of Bretton Woods. Both timelines are represented here: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1968-present)|57.80|\\+10.81%|\\+10.81%|\\+8.30%|\\+4.58%|\\+6.38%|\\+3.94%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+8.19%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|24.80|\\+15.32%|\\+15.52%|\\+8.44%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.07%|\\+3.97%| |After Bretton Woods (1971-present)|54.43|\\+11.16%|\\+11.17%|\\+8.72%|\\+4.50%|\\+6.49%|\\+3.86%| |Republican|30.43|\\+8.00%|\\+7.98%|\\+9.11%|\\+5.19%|\\+9.23%|\\+3.79%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| This period was also characterized by better equity performance under Democratic presidents (+15.52% vs. +7.39%), with similar levels of inflation (+3.97% D vs. +3.92% R). Gold also performed similarly (+8.44% D vs. +8.19% R) regardless of political party in office. However, US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats (+15.52% vs. +8.44%), but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans (+7.39% vs. +8.19%). A similar (but more pronounced) trend can be seen if using the post-Bretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold. # US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international (ex-US) equities. This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy, because when the FOMC cuts, all else being equal, the dollar weakens relative to other currencies, thereby boosting USD-denominated international returns (and vice versa). Unfortunately, we do not have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices, which initially tracked only developed (MSCI World) markets: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|International|Global|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1970-present)|56.05|\\+11.07%|\\+11.05%|\\+8.88%|\\+10.03%|\\+8.84%|\\+4.54%|\\+6.66%|\\+3.89%| |Republican|32.05|\\+8.01%|\\+7.94%|\\+8.17%|\\+8.05%|\\+9.31%|\\+5.22%|\\+9.39%|\\+3.85%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+9.84%|\\+12.74%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| In 55 years of available data, US equities soundly outperformed international (+11.05% vs. +8.88%). However, outperformance came during Democratic presidencies (+15.35% vs. +9.84%); under Republican presidents, US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts (+7.94% vs. +8.17%). I want to emphasize these do not constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international (and certainly not to pull all your stocks out of the market). Past performance is not an indication of future performance. It is as nonsensical to say \"the US always underperforms under X\" as is to say \"the US will always outperform international\". # Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio. Because these are limited to five \"portfolios\" per backtest, for each year, I've put S&P 500, US, Cash, Treasuries, and Inflation in the \"US\" link and international, global, and gold in the \"gold\" or \"intl\" link. Note that these reflective \"cumulative\" returns for each period. All of these are one year periods with the exception of the following: * 1926: 1926-06-30 to 1927-03-04 due to start of data series * 1936: 1936-03-04 to 1937-01-20 due to change in Inauguration Day (20th Amendment) * 2025: 2025-01-20 to 2026-01-16 (current) * 1961, 1968, 1969: Returns for treasuries^†, gold^‡, and international^§ are based on start of data series as indicated in foot notes below. Note that for the sections above, the \"other\" asset classes are aligned to the same date (i.e. US stock returns for \"After Bretton Woods\" started on 1971-08-15), even though these are not shown in the table below. |Year^\\*|Party|President|S&P|US|Intl|Global|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1926 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|10.19%|13.80%||||1.87%||\\-1.77%| |1927 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|22.85%|26.36%||||2.61%||\\-1.65%| |1928 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|50.86%|46.26%||||3.17%||\\-0.08%| |1929 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-4.14%|\\-10.52%||||3.83%||\\-0.59%| |1930 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-22.54%|\\-26.01%||||1.80%||\\-7.65%| |1931 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-45.92%|\\-46.70%||||1.10%||\\-10.20%| |1932 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-27.51%|\\-25.74%||||0.35%||\\-9.92%| |1933 ([US](|Dem|F.

      "selftext_processed": "In a recent thread on rETFs I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international and other asset classes from Testfolio . In brief US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents both on a nominal and an excess above riskfree rate basis a phenomenon known as the presidential puzzle However correlation is not_causation and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of timevarying risk aversion . Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests . Details for the data sources are documentedbacktest SPYSIM Mimics SP 500 . Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928 then Schwert SP 500 composite portfolio through 1962 then SP 500 price index through 1993 then SPY thereafter . VTISIM Total US stock market based on FamaFrench dataset from 19261992 then investible mutual fundsETFs afterwards VXUSSIM International exUS stock market based on MSCI World exUSA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996 then investible mutual funds afterwards . VTSIM Global . VTISIMVXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008 then VT afterwards . GLDSIM Spot gold based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004 then GLD afterwards . TBILL FamaFrench Rf from 19261954 then 3month Tbill rate thereafter . IEFSIM 10year US treasury rate from 19622002 then IEF thereafter . INFLATION Unadjusted CPIU . Additionally to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent I staggered the investment period by starting and ending it on Inauguration Day rather than New Years Day . Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937 prior to 1937 Inauguration Day was March 4 and this is reflected accordingly in the staggered years . As such 1973 refers to the period from 19730120 to 19740120 . Note also that this does not_doublecount January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio invests at the close of the starting day for each period . A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post . US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities cash riskfree treasuries and inflation going back to 1926 with the FamaFrench Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashInflation Overall 1926present99.5610.28 % 10.23 % 3.33 % 2.95 % Republican47.686.58 % 6.33 % 4.34 % 2.22 % Democratic51.8813.80 % 13.95 % 2.42 % 3.63 % PostDepression 1940present86.0011.49 % 11.47 % 3.68 % 3.71 % Republican41.009.07 % 8.96 % 4.69 % 3.43 % Democratic45.0013.74 % 13.81 % 2.77 % 3.97 % Going back to 1926 US equities 10.28 % p.a . did better under Democratic presidencies 13.80 % than under Republican ones 6.58 % . However it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies 3.63 % than under Republican ones 2.22 % cash or shortterm treasury bills paid less 2.42 % under Democrats than under Republicans 4.34 % . We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depressiona terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership but also a very deflationary one with subsequent rebound under FDRby starting our timeline in 1940 . In this case US equities still did better under Democrats 13.74 % than Republicans 9.07 % but the inflation gap 3.97 % vs. 3.43 % is closer shortterm treasury bills still paid less under Democrats 2.77 % vs. 4.69 % . Regardless of which party was in office you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal real and riskfree premium basis . That is US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above riskfree treasury bills . US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962 we have access to IEFSIM which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002 and then on the IEF ETF 710 year treasuries thereafter . This provides a real investment alternative to cashtbills . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1962present64.0510.52 % 10.58 % 4.52 % 6.01 % 3.77 % Republican33.007.54 % 7.39 % 5.27 % 8.94 % 3.92 % Democratic31.0513.78 % 14.06 % 3.72 % 2.98 % 3.60 % During this time US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents 14.06 % vs. 7.39 % . Inflation was similar slightly lower under Democrats 3.60 % vs. 3.92 % . Treasuries paid higher under Republicans 8.94 % vs. 2.98 % which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis . In fact US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents 8.94 % vs. 7.39 % . US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold which has gained in popularity with its recent surge . This is a useful separate gauge because on balance shortterm interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans both on a nominal and real basis . However gold provides a benchmark that is not_directly affected by central bank policy . Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968 Testfolio has data starting on 19680401 . Additionally the US did not_formally break from the gold standard until Nixons announcement on 19710815 marked the end of Bretton Woods . Both timelines are represented here CAGRYearsSP 500USGoldCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1968present57.8010.81 % 10.81 % 8.30 % 4.58 % 6.38 % 3.94 % Republican33.007.54 % 7.39 % 8.19 % 5.27 % 8.94 % 3.92 % Democratic24.8015.32 % 15.52 % 8.44 % 3.68 % 3.07 % 3.97 % After Bretton Woods 1971present54.4311.16 % 11.17 % 8.72 % 4.50 % 6.49 % 3.86 % Republican30.438.00 % 7.98 % 9.11 % 5.19 % 9.23 % 3.79 % Democratic24.0015.31 % 15.35 % 8.23 % 3.64 % 3.11 % 3.94 % This period was also characterized by better equity performance under Democratic presidents 15.52 % vs. 7.39 % with similar levels of inflation 3.97 % D vs. 3.92 % R. Gold also performed similarly 8.44 % D vs. 8.19 % R regardless of political party in office . However US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats 15.52 % vs. 8.44 % but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans 7.39 % vs. 8.19 % . A similar but more pronounced trend can be seen if using the postBretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold . US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international exUS equities . This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy because when the FOMC cuts all else being equal the dollar weakens relative to other currencies thereby boosting USDdenominated international returns and vice versa . Unfortunately we do not_have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices which initially tracked only developed MSCI World markets CAGRYearsSP 500USInternationalGlobalGoldCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1970present56.0511.07 % 11.05 % 8.88 % 10.03 % 8.84 % 4.54 % 6.66 % 3.89 % Republican32.058.01 % 7.94 % 8.17 % 8.05 % 9.31 % 5.22 % 9.39 % 3.85 % Democratic24.0015.31 % 15.35 % 9.84 % 12.74 % 8.23 % 3.64 % 3.11 % 3.94 % In 55 years of available data US equities soundly outperformed international 11.05 % vs. 8.88 % . However outperformance came during Democratic presidencies 15.35 % vs. 9.84 % under Republican presidents US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts 7.94 % vs. 8.17 % . I want to emphasize these do not_constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international and certainly not_to pull all your stocks out of the market . Past performance is not_an indication of future performance . It is as nonsensical to say the US always underperforms under X as is to say the US will always outperform international . Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio . Because these are limited to five portfolios per backtest for each year Ive put SP 500 US Cash Treasuries and Inflation in the US link and international global and gold in the gold or intl link .

All of these are one year periods with the exception of the following 1926 19260630 to 19270304 due to start of data series 1936 19360304 to 19370120 due to change in Inauguration Day 20th Amendment 2025 20250120 to 20260116 current 1961 1968 1969 Returns for treasuries† gold‡ and international§ are based on start of data series as indicated in foot notes below .

Listening to political hacks and bias hate posing as investingmarket experts will cost you bigly . U.S. taking over Greenland is a rare earth bullish and tech bullish by removing the strangle hold China has over rare earth . Full Stop ."

Inflation has come down from the peak, but core inflation still feels sticky, fiscal deficits are large, and the Fed keeps stressing patience rather than urgency. The labor market is still tight by historical standards, wages are growing, and earnings expectations seem to assume margins hold up even with higher financing costs. At the same time, forward multiples, especially in large-cap growth, are still well above long-term averages. What is the strongest fact-based bull case for rates normalizing sooner, and what do you think I am overthinking if higher for longer sticks around?",

The labor market is still tight by historical standards wages are growing and earnings expectations seem to assume margins hold up even with higher financing costs . At the same time forward multiples especially in largecap growth are still well above longterm averages . What is the strongest factbased bull case for rates normalizing sooner and what do you think I am overthinking if higher for longer sticks around"

      "selftext": "2025 was a green year for most countries, with solid gains everywhere. But amid the bull run, returns varied wildly and **South Korea crushed it with +77.8%**. Just wow! But why? Breaking it down: * **Semiconductor mega-rebound (the big driver):** Korea's market is all about semis. Samsung (+155%) and SK Hynix (+275%) dominate the KOSPI. 2025 brought a huge DRAM/NAND cycle recovery, fueled by AI, data centers, GPUs, cloud, and edge computing. SK Hynix nailed it as Nvidia's key HBM supplier! * **South Korea underperformed US/Europe 2021-2024:** Set up for massive catch-up. Investors chased value, and Korea delivered big time. * **Rotation to ex-US markets:** Korea checks every box:tech, industrial, export-focused, liquid. Perfect for ditching overpriced US stocks. * **Weak won + export boost:** KRW stayed soft, supercharging export-heavy firms with higher margins, earnings beats, and stock re-ratings. * **Concentrated market amps up % gains:** Fewer mega-caps, but giants like these explode the overall cap. Quick shoutout to Spain's +64.5% killer run, thanks to: * Booming banks (IBEX heavyweight, low rates juicing lending) * \\~3% GDP surge (beating Euro peers on jobs/investment) * Tourism explosion (post-COVID come back) * Infrastructure boom (EU funds for housing/projects) * Credit upgrades (Moody's/Fitch/S&P drawing investors) * Edge in cheap energy/resilient exports You invested in Korean stocks last year.

      "selftext": "$SNAP is the ultimate contrarian pick. Everyone knows the cons: dilution, inept management thus far, poor ad stack, low ARPU, dick pick app, only teens use it, etc….thus the stock is priced accordingly. SNAP’s revenue has 10x’d since its IPO, yet its market cap has fallen by a third since then. Note that since the market cap figure is used (and not the stock price) this stat accounts for dilution! This is a fascinating statistic, almost mind-blowing. The main reason for this is simple: although SNAP has grown users and revenue by leaps and bounds, it has NEVER made a profit in its history. This is, yet again, an absurd statistic, especially for a company that has almost a billion users and has been around for well over a decade. It has not made a profit because management has simply never cared about profits. The founder and CEO became a billionaire in his 20’s after the IPO, and since his financial needs were taken care of, he decided to go on an empire building spree, which required a lot of capex and high compensation. Unfortunately, he didn’t succeed financially (although snap created a lot of innovative products, others such as meta just copied and monetized them, leaving snap in the dirt). Normally, in this situation, an activist would build up a position, get some board seats, fire the CEO, trim the fat and wasteful spending, and the stock would spike up. However, the founders have total control due to their voting rights, and thus SNAP has been left in the cold by investors. Here is why I think an inflection is coming, and why the stock could explode within the next 1-2 years: Management FINALLY recognizes the need to make money. They have said this several times recently, and in the Q3 call in November, they said they would be willing to monetize even at the expense of user growth and engagement. This is a sea change in attitude. SNAP has just wanted to grow in the past, without caring about profits. The fact that they are pivoting seems to be ignored by Wall St. There is a lot of low-hanging fruit they can pick. You see, when you have a billion users, even small things can create tremendous cashflow. Let’s take their recent announcement to monetize Memories storage. Even if 10% of users agree to pay a couple bucks a month, that could be billions in free cash flow with zero cost (they’re already providing unlimited storage for free). Same with their ad stack. Small improvements can make huge changes due to their massive scale. Without getting too granular, things like Sponsored Snaps have performed really well, and advertising in the inbox was previously an anathema to them. The important thing is that management has a changed attitude when it comes to profits. I could write another ten thousand words about this, but I think it’s long enough. I posted my position above (300k shares) and think we will hit $20 this year after Wall St sees several quarters in a row or increasing free cash flow and profitability. Oh yeah, if the Spectacles release goes well this year, the stock will fly. If it doesn’t, it won’t affect the stock at all since failure is already priced in. Think of Spectacles as a lottery that comes with zero cost. Disclosure: Long 300,000 shares at $7.6.",

      "selftext_processed": "$ SNAP is the ultimate contrarian pick . Everyone knows the cons dilution inept management thus far poor ad stack low ARPU dick pick app only teens use it etc….thus the stock is priced accordingly . SNAP ’ s revenue has 10x ’ d since its IPO yet its market cap has fallen by a third since then . Note that since the market cap figure is used and not_the stock price this stat accounts for dilution This is a fascinating statistic almost mindblowing . The main reason for this is simple although SNAP has grown users and revenue by leaps and bounds it has NEVER_made a profit in its history . This is yet again an absurd statistic especially for a company that has almost a billion users and has been around for well over a decade . It has not_made a profit because management has simply never_cared about profits . The founder and CEO became a billionaire in his 20 ’ s after the IPO and since his financial needs were taken care of he decided to go on an empire building spree which required a lot of capex and high compensation . Unfortunately he didn ’ t succeed financially although snap created a lot of innovative products others such as meta just copied and monetized them leaving snap in the dirt . Normally in this situation an activist would build up a position get some board seats fire the CEO trim the fat and wasteful spending and the stock would spike up . However the founders have total control due to their voting rights and thus SNAP has been left in the cold by investors . Here is why I think an inflection is coming and why the stock could explode within the next 12 years Management FINALLY recognizes the need to make money . They have said this several times recently and in the Q3 call in November they said they would be willing to monetize even at the expense of user growth and engagement . This is a sea change in attitude . SNAP has just wanted to grow in the past without caring about profits . The fact that they are pivoting seems to be ignored by Wall St . There is a lot of lowhanging fruit they can pick . You see when you have a billion users even small things can create tremendous cashflow . Let ’ s take their recent announcement to monetize Memories storage . Even if 10 % of users agree to pay a couple bucks a month that could be billions in free cash flow with zero cost they ’ re already providing unlimited storage for free . Same with their ad stack . Small improvements can make huge changes due to their massive scale . Without getting too granular things like Sponsored Snaps have performed really well and advertising in the inbox was previously an anathema to them . The important thing is that management has a changed attitude when it comes to profits . I could write another ten thousand words about this but I think it ’ s long enough . I posted my position above 300k shares and think we will hit $ 20 this year after Wall St sees several quarters in a row or increasing free cash flow and profitability . Oh yeah if the Spectacles release goes well this year the stock will fly . If it doesn ’ t it won ’ t affect the stock at all since failure is already priced in . Think of Spectacles as a lottery that comes with zero cost . Disclosure Long 300000 shares at $ 7.6 ."

      "selftext": "Question and topic of conversation for S & P 500 Investors: Do you invest in a SP500 index fund, but then buy some sector ETFs to overweight any particular sectors? I saw that Schwab rates specific sectors outlooks monthly. For example, for January 2026, Communication Services, Health Care, and Industrials are all rated to outperform vs the SP500. They also list a few rated to underperform. It would be easy enough to keep your \"SP500\" investment strategy account slightly overweight in those sectors by buying some sector specific ETFs in those sectors rated to outperform. Does anybody do this? If so, how much extra do you put in sectors you hope will outperform the SP500? This is the link to the Schwab webpage that presents their sector ratings.

For example for January 2026 Communication Services Health Care and Industrials are all rated to outperform vs the SP500 . They also list a few rated to underperform . It would be easy enough to keep your SP500 investment strategy account slightly overweight in those sectors by buying some sector specific ETFs in those sectors rated to outperform . Does anybody do this If so how much extra do you put in sectors you hope will outperform the SP500 This is the link to the Schwab webpage that presents their sector ratings . Discussion appreciated"

      "selftext": "With openAI announcing they’re about to start shoving ads into chatgpt there’s gonna be some takes about it being the end of Googles ad business or metas ad revenue, so let’s just sense check that with some numbers. Chat GPT is definitely a consumer juggernaut, at last count has something like 900 million users (give or take) but only a small single digit percentage of those are paying. Ads will be served to the rest. Ad business take serious time to scale. Example, Amazon started offering them around 2017 and by 2020 they only generated $20b in sales for them. Which isn’t small, but it is the context of a trillion dollar company (which Amazon is and which OpenAI is trying to be). Amazons ad business is now $56b per year (2024 figures) so there’s potential there but again, it takes time. As for Meta, they’ll probably be fine. They did $50b in ad revenue too. Only difference? It was in a single quarter not a year. If I had to guess in 5 years time I’d say that one of the LLMs will take a chunk of ad revenue out of the market so that global ad spend will be split differently m, but there’s no good way to figure out who that might be yet (e.g. only 6 months ago Google was the main loser in the AI race, now it’s everyone’s consensus winner).",

      "selftext": "My wife recently transferred her Roth IRA from NW Mutual to a Schwab Roth IRA to avoid certain fees and give her more control over her investments, among other reasons that are irrelevant to this question. Her transferred Roth IRA from NW Mutual consisted of about $50K worth of shares from one mutual fund. Upon completing the Roth IRA transfer from NW Mutual to the Schwab Roth IRA, she tried to purchase some of those same mutual fund shares, but we learned that \"buy orders are not currently being accepted on this fund\" within Schwab. I'm thinking she should have sold her shares through NW Mutual, transferred the cash to Schwab, and then re-purchased through Schwab. Option 1 (this seems to be the worst option). Can my wife sell all of these shares within Schwab and re-allocate that cash to a separate but tradeable stock through her Schwab Roth IRA? Though, if buy orders aren't being accepted through Schwab on this mutual fund, I'm not sure selling these mutual fund shares through Schwab is even an option. Hence my above conclusion that she should have sold through NW Mutual before transferring the Roth IRA cash to Schwab. Also, I believe triggering this Option 1 would create issues surrounding the amount she can contribute in a single year, in addition to tax consequences. OR Option 2. There is a \"swap funds\" feature that I need to investigate and better understand, which seems to be the right way to go about this, or at least the better option. But again, if \"buy orders are not being accepted\" - I'm not sure that's possible under the \"swap.\" Granted, we'd be \"swapping\" which may be allowed and considered a different transaction all together. I presume it would be best to \"swap.\" Though, I'm not sure she can swap portions of the mutual fund into multiple new investments, for instance 50% into a different mutual fund and 50% into an equity/stock. All this said - I should probably just talk to a Schwab representative or a financial professional. Though, any preliminary understanding I can gain here is most appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "My wife recently transferred her Roth IRA from NW Mutual to a Schwab Roth IRA to avoid certain fees and give her more control over her investments among other reasons that are irrelevant to this question . Her transferred Roth IRA from NW Mutual consisted of about $ 50K worth of shares from one mutual fund . Upon completing the Roth IRA transfer from NW Mutual to the Schwab Roth IRA she tried to purchase some of those same mutual fund shares but we learned that buy orders are not_currently being accepted on this fund within Schwab . Im thinking she should have sold her shares through NW Mutual transferred the cash to Schwab and then repurchased through Schwab . Option 1 this seems to be the worst option . Can my wife sell all of these shares within Schwab and reallocate that cash to a separate but tradeable stock through her Schwab Roth IRA Though if buy orders arent being accepted through Schwab on this mutual fund Im not_sure selling these mutual fund shares through Schwab is even an option . Hence my above conclusion that she should have sold through NW Mutual before transferring the Roth IRA cash to Schwab . Also I believe triggering this Option 1 would create issues surrounding the amount she can contribute in a single year in addition to tax consequences . OR Option 2 . There is a swap funds feature that I need to investigate and better understand which seems to be the right way to go about this or at least the better option . But again if buy orders are not_being accepted Im not_sure thats possible under the swap . Granted wed be swapping which may be allowed and considered a different transaction all together . I presume it would be best to swap . Though Im not_sure she can swap portions of the mutual fund into multiple new investments for instance 50 % into a different mutual fund and 50 % into an equitystock . All this said I should probably just talk to a Schwab representative or a financial professional . Though any preliminary understanding I can gain here is most appreciated ."

      "selftext": "OpenAI is rolling out testing of ads to free users and users on cheaper Go plan in the coming weeks. This is the big catalyst that needed to happen for GOOG earnings to finally take a hit, and what I was waiting for before I begin a short position in the stock. I had bought last April and was hoping to hold 1 year to avoid short term capital gains, but sold recently because I felt the risk is too high to continue holding. While users have shifted from Google to ChatGPT, it did not impact GOOG's earnings because advertisers(GOOGLE's actual customers) continued to spend on Google- higher revenue per impression/click/conversion, as well as bot traffic from agents made up for drops in real traffic. But Once OpenAI's ads program expands to all users(rather than just a test), tens of Billions of dollars that are spent on Google ads will be diverted to ChatGPT ads. Google has increasingly provided poor results for advertisers by providing misleading metrics, charging them for conversions that would've happened regardless of paid ads. For example, if you search for a product, often the company that sells the product is a sponsored result. Looking at their data, it looks like you can predict the cost per conversion, but in reality, you are paying for existing traffic. On top of this, because cost per conversion has been rising, advertisers are looking for alternatives that provide better ROI than Google search ads. On top of this, Google's display ads via its adsense network is also taking a hit, as partner websites experience less traffic due to AI overviews and general use of LLMs. ChatGPT ads offer a new way to pay for intent based traffic, and a way for businesses to diversify away from Google. This is likely the beginning of the end for Google. I believe GOOG faces the biggest threat because ChatGPT represents intent based advertising(Can display ads directly relevant to prompt/query), whereas other advertisers like Meta focus more on interest based advertising(displaying banner ads next to irrelevant content, that the user is expected to be interested in based on Machine learning)) Positions: 12/15/2028 $200 Put option",

      "selftext_processed": "OpenAI is rolling out testing of ads to free users and users on cheaper Go plan in the coming weeks . This is the big catalyst that needed to happen for GOOG earnings to finally take a hit and what I was waiting for before I begin a short position in the stock . I had bought last April and was hoping to hold 1 year to avoid short term capital gains but sold recently because I felt the risk is too high to continue holding . While users have shifted from Google to ChatGPT it did not_impact GOOGs earnings because advertisersGOOGLEs actual customers continued to spend on Google higher revenue per impressionclickconversion as well as bot traffic from agents made up for drops in real traffic . But Once OpenAIs ads program expands to all usersrather than just a test tens of Billions of dollars that are spent on Google ads will be diverted to ChatGPT ads . Google has increasingly provided poor results for advertisers by providing misleading metrics charging them for conversions that wouldve happened regardless of paid ads . For example if you search for a product often the company that sells the product is a sponsored result . Looking at their data it looks like you can predict the cost per conversion but in reality you are paying for existing traffic . On top of this because cost per conversion has been rising advertisers are looking for alternatives that provide better ROI than Google search ads . On top of this Googles display ads via its adsense network is also taking a hit as partner websites experience less traffic due to AI overviews and general use of LLMs . ChatGPT ads offer a new way to pay for intent based traffic and a way for businesses to diversify away from Google . This is likely the beginning of the end for Google . I believe GOOG faces the biggest threat because ChatGPT represents intent based advertisingCan display ads directly relevant to promptquery whereas other advertisers like Meta focus more on interest based advertisingdisplaying banner ads next to irrelevant content that the user is expected to be interested in based on Machine learning Positions 12152028 $ 200 Put option"

This is the way I am thinking about it as a 59 year old and would like some feedback especially if I have some blind spots. \\- Taking profits without really taking profits. \\- Hedge against market downturn. \\- Low interest that I pay back to myself. \\- No double taxation as it is a roth. Post tax money in and tax free money out. Are there any down sides other than missing out on market gains which at the age of 59 is not a huge consideration. If I take out the money and there is a %10 correction then I am buying back in at a discount. Thoughts?",

Hedge against market downturn . Low interest that I pay back to myself . No_double taxation as it is a roth . Post tax money in and tax free money out . Are there any down sides other than missing out on market gains which at the age of 59 is not_a huge consideration . If I take out the money and there is a % 10 correction then I am buying back in at a discount . Thoughts"

That is all the stock I own though and I've been told a good approach would be to sell 50-60% and reinvest that into more long term gains. Is someone who is more informed than me on this type of thing able to tell me a.) Does that sound like a good idea and b.) Would it be smarter to sell before the next earnings call, or is there potential for that call to drive the price up and I should sell after? I realize any answers here would be conjecture and speculative, but like I said, im new to this and don't want to have a d'oh! moment if I can avoid one.",

That is all the stock I own though and Ive been told a good approach would be to sell 5060 % and reinvest that into more long term gains . Is someone who is more informed than me on this type of thing able to tell me a . Does that sound like a good idea and b . Would it be smarter to sell before the next earnings call or is there potential for that call to drive the price up and I should sell after I realize any answers here would be conjecture and speculative but like I said im new to this and dont want to have a doh moment if I can avoid one ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’d love any advice on how you’ve resisted the urge to panic sell (or drastically rebalance) to risk-off positions? In my case, as a 36-year-old, I really regret changing the stock/bond mix in my 401(k) more than three times over the past year. About a year ago, I kept waiting for the market to fall apart because of tariffs and all the geopolitical uncertainty, so I shifted to a 60/40 split between stocks and bonds. But as I watched how resilient the market’s been, I kept moving back toward equities. In the process, I’ve probably missed out on \\~10% gains. I keep telling myself, “Don’t touch the 401(k),” but man… the temptation is almost always there. I’ve committed to 50% VOO, 50% Vanguard Target 2065 (because I want international exposure). One solution that’s actually helped: I removed my 401(k) from my Monarch Money account, so I don’t see it whipsawing up and down every time I check my budget and other accounts. **\\*edit** This blew up! I really appreciate all of the thoughtful responses, and much deserved ribbing from a few of you. There's a ton of helpful insights here: \"This is a good learning lesson where you sold when things seemed scary and bought when things felt better, which lost you money.\" \"One thing that helps me is investing into an IRA alongside my 401k. I made the rule for myself that the 401k is set it and forget it. Any stock trading, market timing, rebalancing I do in the IRA. It scratches my investment itch. Regardless of what’s happening in the world or the markets I just leave the 401k alone.\" \"Sounds like you should flip it all to the 2065 and never look at it again.\" \"I'm allowed to reallocate every 6 months (Jan 1 and Jul 1).\"",

      "title": "Canada turns to China as Trump's tariffs and threats bring foes together",
      "selftext": "> With U.S. ties at their lowest point in modern history, Canada is turning to one of the only countries with which it had even worse relations: China. Canada is forging a “new strategic partnership” with China, its second-biggest trading partner, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday during what he called a “historic” trip to Beijing. That includes a break with the United States on tariffs, which have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China since 2017, met with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People. He is one of a series of world leaders shaken by President Donald Trump’s geopolitical disruptions who are traveling to Beijing as it seeks to exploit U.S. unpredictability to bolster its global influence. For Canada, the Trump administration has been especially head-spinning. “The United States used to be a friend and ally,” Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, told NBC News in an interview. Now, “we are treated as an enemy.” > As part of an effort to “recalibrate” the relationship, Carney said Canada had agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products. It’s a major shift for Canada, a major auto producer that in 2024 followed the U.S. in imposing the 100% tariff. Carney said Canadians would also be allowed to travel to China visa-free. > Canadian officials say they are seeking to grow non-U.S. trade by at least 50% over the next 10 years. “Further trade engagement with China should first and foremost be seen as diversification away from the United States,” Ong said. About 75% of Canada’s manufactured goods exports go to the U.S., according to government figures. China is the second-largest market at about 4%.",

Canada is forging a “ new strategic partnership ” with China its secondbiggest trading partner Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday during what he called a “ historic ” trip to Beijing . That includes a break with the United States on tariffs which have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies . Carney the first Canadian prime minister to visit China since 2017 met with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People . He is one of a series of world leaders shaken by President Donald Trump ’ s geopolitical disruptions who are traveling to Beijing as it seeks to exploit U.S. unpredictability to bolster its global influence . For Canada the Trump administration has been especially headspinning . “ The United States used to be a friend and ally ” Guy SaintJacques a former Canadian ambassador to China told NBC News in an interview . Now “ we are treated as an enemy. ” As part of an effort to “ recalibrate ” the relationship Carney said Canada had agreed to cut its 100 % tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products . It ’ s a major shift for Canada a major auto producer that in 2024 followed the U.S. in imposing the 100 % tariff . Carney said Canadians would also be allowed to travel to China visafree .

Hiring the world’s leading expert in this field suggests management is highly confident in their recent progress. The company’s participation in the conference triggered an immediate stock surge. It was confirmed that the Phase 3 study (COMPANION-002) is seeing \"fewer deaths than originally projected.\" New Leadership: Cynthia Sirard (formerly of Sanofi/Genzyme). Transitioning from a Big Pharma firm to a small-cap company implies they must have been presented with an exceptionally compelling offer or outlook. **Key dates:** February 2026: 10-K Filing (Financial & Audit check). Late March 2026: Phase 3 BTC Data Readout (The major binary catalyst). June 2026: ASCO Annual Meeting Full Phase 3 data presentation to the global scientific community.

Also, expected BLA filing with the FDA for the BTC indication. **Price Target** \\- (Assuming 100% success, why not #dreams#): Calculated using a 4x sales multiple on a fully diluted share count (\\~208M shares).

      "selftext": "Well, joke's on us. **INTC is trading at $48.72** as of today. If that diamond-handed maniac held his shares like he promised (he said he was holding for 10 years), his $700k \"disaster\" is now worth over **$1.1 Million**. Nana isn’t rolling in her grave anymore; she’s popping bottles in Valhalla. The \"National Champion\" is back. Here is why we are ripping through $60: • **Uncle Sam is the Whale:** The US Gov literally bought an **$8.9 Billion equity stake**. It’s officially too big to fail. If you short this, you are fighting the printing press. • **Literal Infinite Demand:** KeyBanc just confirmed that **2026 server CPU capacity is 100% SOLD OUT**. Hyperscalers are desperate for chips, and Intel is jacking up prices because they can. • **The Apple Leak:** Trump slipped up and said \"Apple went in\" after the government deal. If Tim Apple starts printing M-chips in Ohio on the new 18A node, the bears are absolutely cooked. • **Yields are Good:** 18A yields are hitting 60-75%. The tech actually works. Lip-Bu Tan (new CEO) isn't playing games. Earnings are **Jan 22**. The rocket is fueling up. **TL;DR:** Grandma Guy was right, just early. Buy shares to respect your elders. 🚀🚀🚀",

Nana isn ’ t rolling in her grave anymore she ’ s popping bottles in Valhalla . The National Champion is back . Here is why we are ripping through $ 60 • Uncle Sam is the Whale The US Gov literally bought an $ 8.9 Billion equity stake . It ’ s officially too big to fail . If you short this you are fighting the printing press . • Literal Infinite Demand KeyBanc just confirmed that 2026 server CPU capacity is 100 % SOLD OUT . Hyperscalers are desperate for chips and Intel is jacking up prices because they can . • The Apple Leak Trump slipped up and said Apple went in after the government deal . If Tim Apple starts printing Mchips in Ohio on the new 18A node the bears are absolutely cooked . • Yields are Good 18A yields are hitting 6075 % . The tech actually works . LipBu Tan new CEO isnt playing games . Earnings are Jan 22 . The rocket is fueling up . TLDR Grandma Guy was right just early . Buy shares to respect your elders . 🚀🚀🚀"

      "title": "Trump to Push Plan for Tech Companies to Fund New Power Plants",
      "selftext": "The Trump administration is planning to propose that the nation’s largest power grid operator hold an emergency auction in which tech companies would bid to have new power plants built, according to people familiar with the matter. The directive, expected Friday, would be an unprecedented attempt by the federal government to check rising electricity prices within PJM Interconnection, a 13-state power market spanning from New Jersey to Kentucky. The [build-out of data centers]( there in response to the artificial-intelligence boom is straining the grid’s capacity and has resulted in substantially higher costs in several of the grid operator’s recent power auctions. The emergency auction would allow tech companies to bid on 15-year contracts for new power plants in deals that would be worth billions of dollars, some of the people said. Bloomberg previously reported on the plans for the auction. PJM, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the U.S., has come under strain in recent years as tech companies seek to connect even more of them to the grid. Power plants there have been going out of service faster than they can be replaced, which has put a squeeze on power supplies as more electricity-hungry facilities come online. Read More [",

I wanted to share it with you guys and have your opinion: VOO - QQQM - NLR I know there are a lot of overlaps between VOO and QQQM. However, I believe in the future of the tech industry. Furthermore to keep the tech industry going I think we need other types of energy, which is why I thought of a nuclear energy fond. I don’t know how their weight will be in my portfolio yet. I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts about the future of the tech industry as well. I’m 24 years old by the way, and my aim is to keep these funds as long as I can whether they go up or down and buy them every month. Thank you so much!",

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.

      "selftext": "Firstly, this is listed on the London Stock Exchange, its not ASC the shipping company, I'm talking about ASOS PLC. Current Market Cap: £340m Cash on Hand: £318m Revenue: £2.46bn Cash runway to 2030+ and flipping FCF positive. Which means they're trading at a Price to sales of 0.13, almost 3 times cheaper than popular bargain names like [JD.com]( What's more is the company is flipping back to profitability and if this continues their FCF could easily exceed their current Market Cap, which would force a complete repricing of its stock. Adjusted EBIDTA up 60% and Margins up 45-47% Insiders are clearly betting on that taking place with insider owned Camelot Capital purchasing shares almost every single trading session. William Barker owns Camelot Capital and also happens to be a board member and serves as deputy chair of ASOS. Now why would he and two other firms be so aggressive towards buying the entire float. * HEARTLAND A/S 28.3% ownership 33,775,687 shares * Mash Holdings Topco Limited (associated with Frasers Group PLC) 23.4%(around 27,900,414 shares). * Camelot Capital Partners LLC 15.4-15.5% 18,473,399 shares. (Owned by the chair of ASOS) Every time Ive seen this type of top heavy share accumulation it leads to a buyout; Just like Walgreens, EA, Skechers, Metro AG and TKO holding WWE, they all saw the exact same mass accumulation of shares right before and into a premium buyout offer. Their second top investor happens to be Fraser Group whom owns Sports Direct, Flannels, [Sofa.com]( and even Game stores. The other interesting option is a buyout from Asia, names like TEMU and others have attempted multiple times to get a listing on the UK stock exchange. A buyout of ASOS would give them access to European distribution, a well established brand AND listings on the London Stock Exchange. Now I could be way off the mark here but given they have cash runway until 2030+ and given it's literally one of the most underpriced $1bn+ revenue stocks listed (on any exchange) it feels worth a punt. Take a look into it and see what you think, I plan on buying some more calls and shares now.",

      "selftext_processed": "Firstly this is listed on the London Stock Exchange its not_ASC the shipping company Im talking about ASOS PLC . Current Market Cap £340m Cash on Hand £318m Revenue £2.46bn Cash runway to 2030 and flipping FCF positive . Which means theyre trading at a Price to sales of 0.13 almost 3 times cheaper than popular bargain names like JD.com Whats more is the company is flipping back to profitability and if this continues their FCF could easily exceed their current Market Cap which would force a complete repricing of its stock . Adjusted EBIDTA up 60 % and Margins up 4547 % Insiders are clearly betting on that taking place with insider owned Camelot Capital purchasing shares almost every single trading session . William Barker owns Camelot Capital and also happens to be a board member and serves as deputy chair of ASOS . Now why would he and two other firms be so aggressive towards buying the entire float . HEARTLAND AS 28.3 % ownership 33775687 shares Mash Holdings Topco Limited associated with Frasers Group PLC 23.4 % around 27900414 shares . Camelot Capital Partners LLC 15.415.5 % 18473399 shares . Owned by the chair of ASOS Every time Ive seen this type of top heavy share accumulation it leads to a buyout Just like Walgreens EA Skechers Metro AG and TKO holding WWE they all saw the exact same mass accumulation of shares right before and into a premium buyout offer . Their second top investor happens to be Fraser Group whom owns Sports Direct Flannels Sofa.com and even Game stores . The other interesting option is a buyout from Asia names like TEMU and others have attempted multiple times to get a listing on the UK stock exchange . A buyout of ASOS would give them access to European distribution a well established brand AND listings on the London Stock Exchange . Now I could be way off the mark here but given they have cash runway until 2030 and given its literally one of the most underpriced $ 1bn revenue stocks listed on any exchange it feels worth a punt . Take a look into it and see what you think I plan on buying some more calls and shares now ."

      "selftext": "U.S. stocks moved higher today as TSMC’s strong earnings and AI outlook helped lift market sentiment. The company reported a sharp jump in profits and announced higher capital spending plans for 2026, reinforcing the idea that AI infrastructure demand remains strong. The news sparked a rally across semiconductors and AI-linked names, helping the Nasdaq and S&P 500 recover recent losses. At the same time, bank stocks advanced on solid earnings, adding some breadth to the move beyond big tech. Renewed AI capex confidence and improving financial earnings, suggests markets are still willing to stay risk-on, at least for now. The key question is whether this turns into sustained momentum or remains a sector-specific rebound. Curious how others are positioning here: sticking with AI leaders, rotating into financials, or staying cautious into the next set of macro data?",

Given, midterms are in Nov and things will get shaky, shall I roll them to Jan 28 - (I will have to spend 3k) as I still believe in the upside or sell them by mid of this year if it’s same/better returns but it will be subject to short term taxes - 40%. I am thinking due to time decay, things will become dicey especially during the last months. What would be the best play here given the situation. There are no roll options where credit happens.",

Given midterms are in Nov and things will get shaky shall I roll them to Jan 28 I will have to spend 3k as I still believe in the upside or sell them by mid of this year if it ’ s samebetter returns but it will be subject to short term taxes 40 % . I am thinking due to time decay things will become dicey especially during the last months . What would be the best play here given the situation . There are no_roll options where credit happens ."

As the title says I thought my employer 401k was invested in the market, but turns out it just has been in a cash reserve, which still isn't bad since it still gets a dividend, my question though is that, if I rollover the 401k into one of my other accounts would that count towards the 7k? Or since its already in an ira account, it won't count towards the limit, silly question, but it's something I'm not sure about and would like clarity.",

As the title says I thought my employer 401k was invested in the market but turns out it just has been in a cash reserve which still isnt bad since it still gets a dividend my question though is that if I rollover the 401k into one of my other accounts would that count towards the 7k Or since its already in an ira account it wont count towards the limit silly question but its something Im not_sure about and would like clarity ."

      "selftext": "Not financial advice. Just sharing how I’m looking at United Microelectronics Corporation and why I think it’s more interesting than most people realize. Everyone talks about AI chips and cutting-edge nodes, but most chips in the world don’t need that. UMC focuses on mature and specialty nodes used in the automobile industry, industrial equipment, power management chips, displays, IoT devices, and networking gear. These markets care more about stability, reliability, and cost than raw performance. Once a customer designs a chip on UMC’s process, they usually stick around for years which creates consistent and predictable demand. Over 80% of global chip volume still comes from mature nodes, and that market is not disappearing anytime soon. With expansions in Singapore, UMC wafer volume capacity is set to be 8 million+ in 2026. This is about half of that of TSMC, but more than other leading global mature node foundries. UMC is not frozen in the past. The company offers 14nm FinFET technology, which gives customers approximately 50–60% better power efficiency versus 28nm, along with improved performance at a reasonable cost. This is ideal for companies that want better chips but don’t want to pay premium prices for leading-edge production. UMC does not need to beat TSMC. It just needs to be dependable and it is. Intel is collaborating with UMC on a 12nm process expected to be manufactured in the United States later this decade. This matters because customers increasingly want less geographic concentration risk. UMC gains access to U.S. manufacturing capacity without building massive new fabs, and Intel benefits from UMC’s experience running a high-mix foundry business. If even 5–10% of UMC’s revenue eventually comes from U.S. manufacturing, that alone could justify a higher valuation. It’s not TSMC, but the market prices UMC as if growth is basically zero. A 20–30% re-rating over the next few years does not seem unreasonable if utilization improves, the Intel partnership delivers, and mature-node demand remains steady. UMC is not a moonshot, but it’s more than a boring chip foundry that keeps the world running. This company is trading at a depressed valuation, with upside optionality tied to U.S. manufacturing and supply-chain diversification. I also believe that this is going to be their year. Volume has been moving like there’s something about to be unearthed. It may not be exciting, but boring businesses with low expectations can still make money if they keep executing. UMC has been doing exactly that for a long time.",

UMC focuses on mature and specialty nodes used in the automobile industry industrial equipment power management chips displays IoT devices and networking gear . These markets care more about stability reliability and cost than raw performance . Once a customer designs a chip on UMC ’ s process they usually stick around for years which creates consistent and predictable demand . Over 80 % of global chip volume still comes from mature nodes and that market is not_disappearing anytime soon . With expansions in Singapore UMC wafer volume capacity is set to be 8 million in 2026 . This is about half of that of TSMC but more than other leading global mature node foundries . UMC is not_frozen in the past . The company offers 14nm FinFET technology which gives customers approximately 50–60 % better power efficiency versus 28nm along with improved performance at a reasonable cost . This is ideal for companies that want better chips but don ’ t want to pay premium prices for leadingedge production . UMC does not_need to beat TSMC . It just needs to be dependable and it is . Intel is collaborating with UMC on a 12nm process expected to be manufactured in the United States later this decade . This matters because customers increasingly want less geographic concentration risk . UMC gains access to U.S. manufacturing capacity without building massive new fabs and Intel benefits from UMC ’ s experience running a highmix foundry business . If even 5–10 % of UMC ’ s revenue eventually comes from U.S. manufacturing that alone could justify a higher valuation . It ’ s not_TSMC but the market prices UMC as if growth is basically zero . A 20–30 % rerating over the next few years does not_seem unreasonable if utilization improves the Intel partnership delivers and maturenode demand remains steady . UMC is not_a moonshot but it ’ s more than a boring chip foundry that keeps the world running . This company is trading at a depressed valuation with upside optionality tied to U.S. manufacturing and supplychain diversification . I also believe that this is going to be their year . Volume has been moving like there ’ s something about to be unearthed . It may not_be exciting but boring businesses with low expectations can still make money if they keep executing . UMC has been doing exactly that for a long time ."

      "selftext": "I’m 26 and just recently started taking investing seriously on my own, and I’m feeling a mix of excitement and regret that I’m trying to process. I do have a 401k through work, so it’s not like I had zero exposure to investing. But if I’m being honest, I never really felt like I was investing for myself. I just contributed, picked a default option, and didn’t think about it much. Over the past couple of weeks, I finally built a real budget, automated my savings, opened a Roth IRA, and started consistently investing outside of my job. For the first time, I actually feel in control of my money instead of just letting things happen. That part feels really good. At the same time, I keep catching myself looking backward. I see certain stocks or ETFs with massive long-term returns and my brain immediately goes to “I had money back then, why didn’t I invest on my own?” I know logically that hindsight is 20/20 and that I couldn’t have known what would take off, but emotionally it still feels like FOMO mixed with being hard on myself for not starting sooner. I guess I’m posting because I want to hear from people who’ve been through this phase. Did you feel regret or second-guessing when you started taking investing seriously outside of a 401k? How did you stop comparing where you are now to what could have been and just focus on building forward? I’m committed to staying consistent and playing the long game. I just don’t want hindsight regret to mess with something positive I’m finally building.",

Over the past couple of weeks I finally built a real budget automated my savings opened a Roth IRA and started consistently investing outside of my job . For the first time I actually feel in control of my money instead of just letting things happen . That part feels really good . At the same time I keep catching myself looking backward . I see certain stocks or ETFs with massive longterm returns and my brain immediately goes to “ I had money back then why didn ’ t I invest on my own ” I know logically that hindsight is 2020 and that I couldn ’ t have known what would take off but emotionally it still feels like FOMO mixed with being hard on myself for not_starting sooner . I guess I ’ m posting because I want to hear from people who ’ ve been through this phase . Did you feel regret or secondguessing when you started taking investing seriously outside of a 401k How did you stop comparing where you are now to what could have been and just focus on building forward I ’ m committed to staying consistent and playing the long game .

Financially the company also looks good overall with growing revenue and net income as well as very low debt. However, I’m still skeptical of this valuation by virtue of comparing to Meta. Even Meta only had a P/E in the 70-120 range in its first few years post-IPO with a highest post-IPO P/E of 118. It’s just hard to believe that Reddit will be able to attract users at the same rate as early Meta. What do you think? Is there factors I’m missing?",

      "title": "Three reasons Lilly's orforglipron will end up being as effective as Novo's Wegovy pill",
      "selftext": "Reason 1.) Novo has been heavily marketing Wegovy pill's 16.6% weight loss but that number has to be taken into context. That number comes from the OASIS-4 trial which only had 307 patients. A small number by Phase 3 standards. Also that trial was not diverse at all, it was 79% female and 92% white. Why this matters is because there is increasing data that suggests females and whites respond better to GLP drugs. So given the small amount of people in the trial, and the fact that there was an over-representation of the most responsive patient type, one can see how that 16.6% weight loss was achieved, and one can see how this won't really be representative of a global population. By comparison, the ATTAIN-1 trial for orforglipron, where we saw 12.4% weight loss, had 3127 patients, 64% female, and 57% white. In orfo's phase 2 they achieved 13.5% weight loss at 36 weeks. That study had 272 patients, 59% female, 91% white. The more females and more whites will give you better weight loss numbers. Reason 2.) We actually have a head-to-head trial in ACHIEVE-3. Yes it was in a diabetic population, but that's a good thing, because diabetics are harder to treat for weight loss. In ACHIEVE-3, the 12mg orfo dose (6.7% weight loss) beat the 14mg sema dose (5.3% weight loss). Novo did their own trial in diabetics for oral sema, PIONEER PLUS. In that trial they got 4.7% weight loss for 14mg, and 8.2% for 25mg and 9.6% for 50mg. Looking at the 14mg dose that was used in both trials, we can see the results were similar. now we can compare the 9.2% weight loss from 36mg orfo to the 8.2% from 25mg sema and all the data suggests orfo will be as good, if not even better, than oral sema (at the very least in diabetics). Reason 3.) Results of the ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial just came out and when patients switched from Wegovy 1.7/2.4mg to orfo 36mg, they gained back only 1% of their weight. In contrast, the Zepbound 10/15mg arm of the study gained back 5% of their weight. The most interesting number is that both arms ended up with the exact same weight by the end of the trial. If you average it out, it's about 16% weight loss. This suggests that orfo will stabilize at around that mid teens number that we keep seeing for single agonist GLP's. In conclusion, when you look further and further into the data, we will arrive at a logical assertion, that sufficient GLP agonism will get you to that mid teens weight loss number. Orforglipron will achieve a very similar efficacy to Wegovy pill in the real world. Everything you hear about Wegovy pill being more efficacious than orforglipron is just marketing, using ONE small study filled with white women who typically respond better to GLP drugs. Orforglipron only had ONE large study in a much more diverse population and the numbers came back \"disappointing\" but as more and more data comes out, you can see the efficacy will be there in the real world.",

      "selftext_processed": "Reason 1 . Novo has been heavily marketing Wegovy pills 16.6 % weight loss but that number has to be taken into context . That number comes from the OASIS4 trial which only had 307 patients . A small number by Phase 3 standards . Also that trial was not_diverse at all it was 79 % female and 92 % white . Why this matters is because there is increasing data that suggests females and whites respond better to GLP drugs . So given the small amount of people in the trial and the fact that there was an overrepresentation of the most responsive patient type one can see how that 16.6 % weight loss was achieved and one can see how this wont really be representative of a global population . By comparison the ATTAIN1 trial for orforglipron where we saw 12.4 % weight loss had 3127 patients 64 % female and 57 % white . In orfos phase 2 they achieved 13.5 % weight loss at 36 weeks . That study had 272 patients 59 % female 91 % white . The more females and more whites will give you better weight loss numbers . Reason 2 . We actually have a headtohead trial in ACHIEVE3 . Yes it was in a diabetic population but thats a good thing because diabetics are harder to treat for weight loss . In ACHIEVE3 the 12mg orfo dose 6.7 % weight loss beat the 14mg sema dose 5.3 % weight loss . Novo did their own trial in diabetics for oral sema PIONEER PLUS . In that trial they got 4.7 % weight loss for 14mg and 8.2 % for 25mg and 9.6 % for 50mg . Looking at the 14mg dose that was used in both trials we can see the results were similar . now we can compare the 9.2 % weight loss from 36mg orfo to the 8.2 % from 25mg sema and all the data suggests orfo will be as good if not_even better than oral sema at the very least in diabetics . Reason 3 . Results of the ATTAINMAINTAIN trial just came out and when patients switched from Wegovy 1.72.4mg to orfo 36mg they gained back only 1 % of their weight . In contrast the Zepbound 1015mg arm of the study gained back 5 % of their weight . The most interesting number is that both arms ended up with the exact same weight by the end of the trial . If you average it out its about 16 % weight loss . This suggests that orfo will stabilize at around that mid teens number that we keep seeing for single agonist GLPs . In conclusion when you look further and further into the data we will arrive at a logical assertion that sufficient GLP agonism will get you to that mid teens weight loss number . Orforglipron will achieve a very similar efficacy to Wegovy pill in the real world . Everything you hear about Wegovy pill being more efficacious than orforglipron is just marketing using ONE small study filled with white women who typically respond better to GLP drugs . Orforglipron only had ONE large study in a much more diverse population and the numbers came back disappointing but as more and more data comes out you can see the efficacy will be there in the real world ."

That’s why physical silver around the world is being bought up and upcharged in every country. Once that continues to dry up, you are going to wish you would have bought >$100",

As a business owner online my sales went up 20 percent once I offered a PayPal. In addition who doesn’t use Venmo. LMT, US military backed (they’re double the budget) or also ticker Hii. US is definitely preparing for something so military will benefit MDLZ, Cadbury,Oreos Etc. significantly undervalued due to High Milk,Eggs,Cacao prices that have fallen significantly. They’re set to kill earnings and their PE is 10. TDD, financials are amazing, they maximize ROI as a broker for many businesses. They’re not going anywhere and have had a significant overcorrection. NU is a Brazilian Bank that’s rapidly expanding with great value Devon energy and Oxy-Pet for Oil! Gild and BMY for healthcare picks This is very unpopular today because everyone wants to get rich quick. I read the financials,Balance sheets and look for Margin of safety. When you look at tech you realize AI stocks are mostly gambling at this moment and significantly overvalued. It always ends when people least expect it, I did 80 percent last year. My tech stocks went stupid. Mr Market gave me an offer that was too good. Don’t become desensitized to AI Tech Companies Absurd valuations. Here’s something you should really Really understand about stocks. Do Not Overpay. That means you need to understand financials. 95 percent of retail lose because they think they’re talented and geniuses because the stock goes up. They Lose 95 percent of the time OVER the COURSE of a DECADE because Arrogance->feel justified because price increases-> start to believe they’re better than legends like buffet->Continue investing the same for 5 years. Then they’re left exposed,naked and embarrassed about the ego they had when the NASDAQ crashes 70percent over the course of 3 years like in 2000",

It always ends when people least expect it I did 80 percent last year . My tech stocks went stupid . Mr Market gave me an offer that was too good . Don ’ t become desensitized to AI Tech Companies Absurd valuations . Here ’ s something you should really Really understand about stocks . Do Not_Overpay . That means you need to understand financials . 95 percent of retail lose because they think they ’ re talented and geniuses because the stock goes up .

RDDTRDTL is responsible for a massive chunk of my gains . YOLOd with 100k into RDTL shares before Q3 25 earnings . Sold at the top then went back in after it sold back to 200 . Cashed out a few days ago before it collapsed today . Before the inevitable See you back here tomorrow I am starting a new job next week where my personal trading is restricted and thus I am forced into a passive strategy so I can focus on my career instead of gambling my life savings on meme stocks . Cashed out of all my positions today and tomorrow Im putting all my proceeds into VOO and DCAing for the rest of my life . Its been real god speed everyone ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ >The U.S. and Taiwan signed a trade deal Thursday aimed at boosting American production of semiconductors in exchange for lower tariffs, adding to the Trump administration’s efforts to bring critical industries to the U.S. >Under the agreement, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will add several new factories to its cluster in Arizona as part of a $250 billion investment in the U.S., the Commerce Department said. In exchange, the U.S. is cutting tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15%, from 20%, and exempting Taiwanese chip companies like TSMC that are investing more in America. The contours of the deal were reported earlier in the week. >The agreement adds to deals with trading partners including the European Union and Japan and a truce with China. The Trump administration is attempting to de-escalate tensions over tariffs to avoid denting the economy while securing added investment in the U.S. >The Taiwan deal focuses on semiconductors because of the dominance of TSMC, which essentially has a monopoly on making the advanced chips that power the modern economy. They are critical for customers from Nvidia to Apple that want to build data centers for training AI models or sell consumer products. >TSMC has received several billion dollars in subsidies through the 2022 Chips and Science Act and will have roughly a dozen plants in Arizona after its latest expansion, including some advanced manufacturing capabilities that give it a sizable footprint outside Taiwan. >“We’re going to bring it all over so we become self-sufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC. >Skeptics say TSMC still has most of its footprint in Taiwan and that the U.S. plants represent a long-planned move to reduce risk by building outside the island nation. Creating a meaningful chunk of the global semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. would take decades and be costly, they say. >TSMC’s moves are in focus because the company is a big driver of Taiwan’s economy and seen by some observers as a deterrent for a Chinese invasion. China claims the self-ruled island as its own territory, to be seized by force if necessary. >China has taken a more aggressive stance toward Taiwan recently, but some analysts say it wouldn’t want to tank the global economy by attacking Taiwan and potentially disrupting TSMC’s production of chips. That supply also gives the U.S. incentive to protect Taiwan, they say. >Under the trade agreement, Taiwan has committed to help building domestic industrial parks like those TSMC has in Arizona. The company recently bought 900 acres of land to expand its presence there. >TSMC said Thursday it plans to spend up to $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, highlighting unrelenting demand for its chips.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source The U.S. and Taiwan signed a trade deal Thursday aimed at boosting American production of semiconductors in exchange for lower tariffs adding to the Trump administration ’ s efforts to bring critical industries to the U.S . Under the agreement Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will add several new factories to its cluster in Arizona as part of a $ 250 billion investment in the U.S. the Commerce Department said . In exchange the U.S. is cutting tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15 % from 20 % and exempting Taiwanese chip companies like TSMC that are investing more in America . The contours of the deal were reported earlier in the week . The agreement adds to deals with trading partners including the European Union and Japan and a truce with China . The Trump administration is attempting to deescalate tensions over tariffs to avoid denting the economy while securing added investment in the U.S . The Taiwan deal focuses on semiconductors because of the dominance of TSMC which essentially has a monopoly on making the advanced chips that power the modern economy . They are critical for customers from Nvidia to Apple that want to build data centers for training AI models or sell consumer products . TSMC has received several billion dollars in subsidies through the 2022 Chips and Science Act and will have roughly a dozen plants in Arizona after its latest expansion including some advanced manufacturing capabilities that give it a sizable footprint outside Taiwan . “ We ’ re going to bring it all over so we become selfsufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors ” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC . Skeptics say TSMC still has most of its footprint in Taiwan and that the U.S. plants represent a longplanned move to reduce risk by building outside the island nation . Creating a meaningful chunk of the global semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. would take decades and be costly they say . TSMC ’ s moves are in focus because the company is a big driver of Taiwan ’ s economy and seen by some observers as a deterrent for a Chinese invasion . China claims the selfruled island as its own territory to be seized by force if necessary . China has taken a more aggressive stance toward Taiwan recently but some analysts say it wouldn ’ t want to tank the global economy by attacking Taiwan and potentially disrupting TSMC ’ s production of chips . That supply also gives the U.S. incentive to protect Taiwan they say . Under the trade agreement Taiwan has committed to help building domestic industrial parks like those TSMC has in Arizona . The company recently bought 900 acres of land to expand its presence there . TSMC said Thursday it plans to spend up to $ 56 billion on capital expenditures this year highlighting unrelenting demand for its chips ."

As part of the agreement, Taiwanese chip and technology companies will invest at least $250 billion in production capacity in the U.S., and the Taiwanese government will guarantee $250 billion in credit for these companies. In exchange, the U.S. will limit reciprocal tariffs on Taiwan to 15%, down from 20%, and commit to zero reciprocal tariffs on generic pharmaceuticals, their ingredients, aircraft components, and some natural resources. Taiwan Semiconductor has bought land and could expand in Arizona as part of this deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan in an interview on Thursday. “They just bought hundreds of acres adjacent to their property,” Lutnick said. “I’ll let them go through with their board and give them time.” Read more: [",

It’s worked out well so far. Hopefully the market doesn’t tank soon. Also using the wheel strategy in my brokerage account to make additional investment funds.

      "selftext": "These seem relatively new in terms of regulated securities overall, and now making their way into ETFs. Heard about them on a recent Planet Money podcast, and it piqued my curiosity. In a nutshell, it's basically disaster insurance. If no disasters happen, the premiums are collected and never returned to the insured. If disaster does happen - and there are very specific definitions on that - the bond pays out. They seem like they are an interesting way to get some returns, perhaps as a part of a balanced dividend portfolio. *And* \\- one of the real selling points is that it is largely disconnected from any other real market. It's just mother nature, and accounting for risk appropriately. If the global stock market breaks down, or gold, or bonds, or housing, or whatever ... those things often tug and pull at other investment sectors as well. But the # of hurricanes that will hit the Caribbean this year has nothing to do with whether we're in an AI bubble or not, how lopsided the S&P is to the Mag7, etc. Symbol: ILS",

If no_disasters happen the premiums are collected and never_returned to the insured . If disaster does happen and there are very specific definitions on that the bond pays out . They seem like they are an interesting way to get some returns perhaps as a part of a balanced dividend portfolio . And one of the real selling points is that it is largely disconnected from any other real market . Its just mother nature and accounting for risk appropriately . If the global stock market breaks down or gold or bonds or housing or whatever ... those things often tug and pull at other investment sectors as well . But the of hurricanes that will hit the Caribbean this year has nothing_to do with whether were in an AI bubble or not_how lopsided the SP is to the Mag7 etc . Symbol ILS"

      "selftext": "So I just started leasing a car and it fits well into my budget and has helped me put off taking out a loan or using all my savings to pay for a car. I have 3 years to save up money for when my lease ends to either buy that car or go buy a different car. I currently work a job where I have a salary, that covers all of my bills with a little left over after (maybe $500/mo), and a partial commission that helps me earn maybe an extra $100-300 a month on average. I would like to start saving a little every month so when these 3 years are up, I have a good amount saved for my future car purchase. I was thinking about making an additional account on my Sofi app for just this and investing in probably something pretty safe like ETFs. I'm decently versed in investing, so I don't need advice on what to invest in or whatever. My main question is, are there ways to avoid a bunch of fees when I go to take that money out in 3 years? Or will I just have to pay capital gains tax or something? I've never taken money out of my investment accounts before so I have no idea what that process is like. Thanks!",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is earmarking as much as $56 billion in capital spending for 2026, a stronger-than-anticipated projection that signals its confidence in the longevity of the global AI boom. >Asia’s most valuable company expects expenditures of $52 billion to $56 billion this year, up at least a quarter from 2025. It also foresees revenue growth of close to 30% in 2026, faster than the average analyst estimate. Shares in key supplier ASML Holding NV rose 7.6% to a record in Europe, sending its market value beyond $500 billion. >The outlook from TSMC — a bellwether for the artificial intelligence boom — reflects a development frenzy by the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Inc. that’s spurred demand for Nvidia Corp. accelerators. It’s likely to help assuage some concerns about the sustainability of current data center spending. TSMC — Nvidia’s main chipmaker — is accelerating its own global capacity buildout, most notably in the US, to sate future demand. >“You’re trying to ask us whether AI demand is real or not. I’m also very nervous about it,” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said in response to an analyst’s question on a conference call. “We’re investing $52 billion to $56 billion in capex, right? If we don’t do it carefully, that’d be a big disaster for TSMC.” >Click here for a liveblog on the results. >TSMC reported NT$505.7 billion ($16 billion) in net income for the December quarter, beating the average estimate. That’s off previously reported sales of $33.1 billion in the period, helping the company surpass $100 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2025. >Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang this month reaffirmed demand for AI accelerators continues to run hot. That’s a sentiment echoed by his Advanced Micro Devices Inc. counterpart Lisa Su, who expects the need for more AI computing power and the number of users to surge again. >“TSMC’s 2026 guidance underscores AI as a key driver of earnings growth for Asian equities in the near term,” said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. >The effort to build and fill data centers with AI chips, now surpassing $1 trillion in planned expenditures, has helped TSMC achieve more than 30% annual sales growth over the past two years. But it may also hamper some parts of the company’s business. >An acute memory chip supply crunch emerged in 2025, when manufacturers prioritized premium high-bandwidth memory to go with Nvidia and AMD chips. That’s forcing consumer electronics makers to hike prices. Industry watchers like IDC are slashing their shipment estimates for this year. >Hsinchu-based TSMC still relies on Apple Inc.’s iPhone and smartphones using Qualcomm Inc.’s advanced processors for a substantial portion of its business. The memory crunch is expected to cut into mobile device sales in 2026: Macquarie Capital expects an annual decline for smartphones of 11.6%. >On Thursday, Wei said his company won’t get impacted by the memory chip crunch this year or next as high-end smartphones are still selling well. >TSMC will be a key part of an imminent trade deal between the US and Taiwan. It’s expected to commit to build more chip fabrication facilities and add to plans to invest as much as $165 billion in the US. >It’s also building plants in Japan and Germany, propelling an international expansion while developing the most advanced technology at home. Wei said several times that TSMC will work to “close the gap” in supply versus demand.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is earmarking as much as $ 56 billion in capital spending for 2026 a strongerthananticipated projection that signals its confidence in the longevity of the global AI boom . Asia ’ s most valuable company expects expenditures of $ 52 billion to $ 56 billion this year up at least a quarter from 2025 . It also foresees revenue growth of close to 30 % in 2026 faster than the average analyst estimate . Shares in key supplier ASML Holding NV rose 7.6 % to a record in Europe sending its market value beyond $ 500 billion . The outlook from TSMC — a bellwether for the artificial intelligence boom — reflects a development frenzy by the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Inc. that ’ s spurred demand for Nvidia Corp. accelerators . It ’ s likely to help assuage some concerns about the sustainability of current data center spending . TSMC — Nvidia ’ s main chipmaker — is accelerating its own global capacity buildout most notably in the US to sate future demand . “ You ’ re trying to ask us whether AI demand is real or not_I ’ m also very nervous about it ” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said in response to an analyst ’ s question on a conference call . “ We ’ re investing $ 52 billion to $ 56 billion in capex right If we don ’ t do it carefully that ’ d be a big disaster for TSMC. ” Click here for a liveblog on the results . TSMC reported NT $ 505.7 billion $ 16 billion in net income for the December quarter beating the average estimate . That ’ s off previously reported sales of $ 33.1 billion in the period helping the company surpass $ 100 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2025 . Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang this month reaffirmed demand for AI accelerators continues to run hot . That ’ s a sentiment echoed by his Advanced Micro Devices Inc. counterpart Lisa Su who expects the need for more AI computing power and the number of users to surge again . “ TSMC ’ s 2026 guidance underscores AI as a key driver of earnings growth for Asian equities in the near term ” said Gary Tan a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments . The effort to build and fill data centers with AI chips now surpassing $ 1 trillion in planned expenditures has helped TSMC achieve more than 30 % annual sales growth over the past two years . But it may also hamper some parts of the company ’ s business . An acute memory chip supply crunch emerged in 2025 when manufacturers prioritized premium highbandwidth memory to go with Nvidia and AMD chips . That ’ s forcing consumer electronics makers to hike prices . Industry watchers like IDC are slashing their shipment estimates for this year . Hsinchubased TSMC still relies on Apple Inc. ’ s iPhone and smartphones using Qualcomm Inc. ’ s advanced processors for a substantial portion of its business . The memory crunch is expected to cut into mobile device sales in 2026 Macquarie Capital expects an annual decline for smartphones of 11.6 % . On Thursday Wei said his company won ’ t get impacted by the memory chip crunch this year or next as highend smartphones are still selling well . TSMC will be a key part of an imminent trade deal between the US and Taiwan . It ’ s expected to commit to build more chip fabrication facilities and add to plans to invest as much as $ 165 billion in the US . It ’ s also building plants in Japan and Germany propelling an international expansion while developing the most advanced technology at home . Wei said several times that TSMC will work to “ close the gap ” in supply versus demand ."

Over the holidays a close family member passed away and just this week, I found out they left me a huge surprise... $500,000 in a Schwab account and $50k cash. I have no idea what stocks/bonds/etfs/etc. it is invested in yet, nor any idea on how to handle this life changing windfall. My wife and I have a few ideas for the cash , but this is an amount I only ever dreamed of having and certainly dont want to squander it or make a mistake that I will regret decades down the road. Some information on our current financial situation: We own our home valued at $360k still owing $278k with a 2.75% interest rate. I have $26k in a personal brokerage account. $3k in a Roth IRA, $25k in my company 401k and make an annual pre-tax wage of about $90k - $100k with salary and overtime. The Wife makes around $90k annually as well, with only $3k in a Roth IRA. No other investments. We've only had these well paying jobs for about 2yrs. We have a vehicle loan with $9k left on it, and a solar loan with about $10k left on it. No other debt (besides the previously mentioned mortgage). As I stated, I am completely over my head with this amount of money and am looking for guidance on how to navigate this situation. Any insight is welcome.",

Over the holidays a close family member passed away and just this week I found out they left me a huge surprise ... $ 500000 in a Schwab account and $ 50k cash . I have no_idea what stocksbondsetfsetc . it is invested in yet nor any idea on how to handle this life changing windfall . My wife and I have a few ideas for the cash but this is an amount I only ever dreamed of having and certainly dont want to squander it or make a mistake that I will regret decades down the road . Some information on our current financial situation We own our home valued at $ 360k still owing $ 278k with a 2.75 % interest rate . I have $ 26k in a personal brokerage account . $ 3k in a Roth IRA $ 25k in my company 401k and make an annual pretax wage of about $ 90k $ 100k with salary and overtime . The Wife makes around $ 90k annually as well with only $ 3k in a Roth IRA . No_other investments . Weve only had these well paying jobs for about 2yrs . We have a vehicle loan with $ 9k left on it and a solar loan with about $ 10k left on it . No_other debt besides the previously mentioned mortgage . As I stated I am completely over my head with this amount of money and am looking for guidance on how to navigate this situation . Any insight is welcome ."

The job offers benefits but I’m not too knowledgable on them. I also have a 10K from grad party. What are things I should be taught before I start working even longer from now? 30$ an hour is decent money at 19. For more info I live with a friend who covers everything. That’s why I have no bills or debt. It’s why I even have the job. Now how do I invest to become rich or just well off?",

      "selftext": "I've been studying for a while the market history. The \"time in the market\" saying is true; if you get the US stock market 200-year average, even the 1929 crash feels more like a correction than what it really was. 2020 is just a blip in the bigger scheme of things. But we all aren't likely to even see 2100, so our time in the market isn't that great. Some of those blips are huge things for a single lifetime, hence the question. At what point a correction and a \"fasten your seatbelts\" scenario actually becomes a general disaster that will ruin a lot of people and take years to recover? For example, all the signs in April would point to a major downturn in the following months. Seeing it now, in the end it was just a small bump on the road. Even in the pandemic, everyone was somewhat able to foreshadow the shit hitting the fan (the S&P 500 began to fall down in mid-late february 2020, and we all were seeing huge news everywhere since december 2019). Anyone with a minor glance of the news could see what was likely to come in the following months. Now in 2026, everyone is talking of AI bubble, another global recession in the likes of 2008, an apocalyptical disaster scenario where everything starting falling from the sky. But for someone investing, what would be the line (or zone) between keeping the stocks during a poor month, and outright selling them all to avoid being hit by a crisis? What could be the next triggers for it to happen?",

      "selftext": "Listen up you beautiful financially illiterate degenerates, put down the SPY 0DTE lotto tickets for 30 seconds and use your 2 remaining brain cells. MDA Space (MDA.TO) (MDALF) for OTC is an actual space company, not another fake AI “cloud-enabled synergies” scam. These Canadian nerds have been building space tech since the 60s and now they’re a full-on “international space mission partner” doing satellite systems, space robotics, and geo-intelligence. Translation: they make the robot arms that grab space junk, build the metal sky-wafers that beam your doomscrolling, and sell government-grade spy-pictures so your bagholding gets watched from orbit. They build and operate satellite constellations for communications, Earth and space observation, and exploration infrastructure. Their customers are governments and big-boy contractors, not Dave from Robinhood on margin. THINK GOLDEN DOME They even rebranded from “MDA Ltd.” to “MDA Space” in 2024, which is marketing-speak for “please give us a space stonk multiple.” As of mid-January 2026 the thing trades around the high 20s CAD, after ripping last year into the 40s before the apes collectively discovered zero day options again and forgot Canada exists. You’re telling me clapped-up EV penny stocks can trade at nosebleed valuations, but an actual space hardware and geo-intel shop with real government contracts is stuck on the TSX begging for volume like a low-effort meme post? Pete Hegseth is now literally the guy in charge of handing out the Pentagon’s space money, so the MDA ape thesis basically writes itself. And while you smoothbrains are dumpster-diving weekly options, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is out touring Starbase and yelling at defense contractors to “move quickly, embrace risks, be bold” with new tech and space systems. If the guy running the world’s biggest military budget wants less bloated bureaucracy and more orbital hardware, maybe just maybe an actual Canadian space shop with satellites, robotics, and geo-intel isn’t the dumbest place to park a few loonies PT $200 CAD",

These Canadian nerds have been building space tech since the 60s and now they ’ re a fullon “ international space mission partner ” doing satellite systems space robotics and geointelligence . Translation they make the robot arms that grab space junk build the metal skywafers that beam your doomscrolling and sell governmentgrade spypictures so your bagholding gets watched from orbit . They build and operate satellite constellations for communications Earth and space observation and exploration infrastructure . Their customers are governments and bigboy contractors not_Dave from Robinhood on margin . THINK GOLDEN DOME They even rebranded from “ MDA Ltd. ” to “ MDA Space ” in 2024 which is marketingspeak for “ please give us a space stonk multiple. ” As of midJanuary 2026 the thing trades around the high 20s CAD after ripping last year into the 40s before the apes collectively discovered zero day options again and forgot Canada exists . You ’ re telling me clappedup EV penny stocks can trade at nosebleed valuations but an actual space hardware and geointel shop with real government contracts is stuck on the TSX begging for volume like a loweffort meme post Pete Hegseth is now literally the guy in charge of handing out the Pentagon ’ s space money so the MDA ape thesis basically writes itself . And while you smoothbrains are dumpsterdiving weekly options Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is out touring Starbase and yelling at defense contractors to “ move quickly embrace risks be bold ” with new tech and space systems . If the guy running the world ’ s biggest military budget wants less bloated bureaucracy and more orbital hardware maybe just maybe an actual Canadian space shop with satellites robotics and geointel isn ’ t the dumbest place to park a few loonies PT $ 200 CAD"

      "selftext": "Hello, looking for some opinions here. I live in **Lebanon (not US)**. I make about **$2,600/month net**, work full time as a software engineer, and still live with my parents so my expenses aren’t that high. No other income. Right now I’ve got roughly **$24k total**: * about **$18k in gold** (4 oz) * **$1.5k stocks** * **$2.2k crypto** * **$2.5k cash** I’m considering buying an apartment for **$115k**. It’s **83 sqm, 2 bedrooms**, building is around **25 years old**, quiet area close to where I live. Rent would probably be: * **~$500/month unfurnished** * **~$600/month furnished**, but I’d need to buy furniture first To do this I’d basically have to liquidate most of what I own, put **$25k down**, and take a **$90k loan at 6% interest**. That’s pretty much the only housing loan option here. My idea was to try and **pay it off fast** (maybe ~7 years if I really push it), keep it rented, and then maybe use it later to buy another place. What I’m struggling with: * Is this actually a decent move or am I forcing my first real estate deal? * Selling gold for this feels risky… but also holding it forever feels like doing nothing * Am I missing something obvious (maintenance, vacancies, bad math, etc.)? If you were in my situation, would you do this or just stay liquid and wait? Appreciate any thoughts.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello looking for some opinions here . I live in Lebanon not US . I make about $ 2600month net work full time as a software engineer and still live with my parents so my expenses aren ’ t that high . No_other income . Right now I ’ ve got roughly $ 24k total about $ 18k in gold 4 oz $ 1.5k stocks $ 2.2k crypto $ 2.5k cash I ’ m considering buying an apartment for $ 115k . It ’ s 83 sqm 2 bedrooms building is around 25 years old quiet area close to where I live . Rent would probably be $ 500month unfurnished $ 600month furnished but I ’ d need to buy furniture first To do this I ’ d basically have to liquidate most of what I own put $ 25k down and take a $ 90k loan at 6 % interest . That ’ s pretty much the only housing loan option here . My idea was to try and pay it off fast maybe 7 years if I really push it keep it rented and then maybe use it later to buy another place . What I ’ m struggling with Is this actually a decent move or am I forcing my first real estate deal Selling gold for this feels risky… but also holding it forever feels like doing nothing_ Am I missing something obvious maintenance vacancies bad math etc . If you were in my situation would you do this or just stay liquid and wait Appreciate any thoughts ."

I'm relatively new in my investment journey but I have done a fair amount of research. In March 2025, my portfolio was down 30% and it really didn't bother me one bit. The only issue I had was that since I was already 100% invested, I didn't have cash to buy more at the discounted prices :( Next time when something like this happens, I want to be able to make the best use of it. 1. Should I keep some money in gold, silver or bonds? If yes, how much? I don't care about short term fluctuations and want highest expected returns in the long term. 3. I read a research paper suggesting 100% equities for long horizon, but then I will have the same problem as last year. Maybe I can go 100% equities but keep a big chunk of it in a broad index. When the downturn comes, sell some of it to buy high conviction stocks trading at more extreme discounts. 3. I am also thinking of changing my pension funds from target date to fully broad market equity. Thoughts? I'd appreciate any suggestions. It will be really helpful if you could point me to some good resources like research papers, blogposts, etc. Thank you very much!!",

Clearly the world markets are reacting to the instability being caused by the US. The USA is going in a very different direction than it has for the decades of American stock market over performance. Personally I think it's incredibly risky to not have a significant international portion of anyone's portfolio at this point. I have rebalanced to ~60/40 International/US in my equities given what I'm seeing happening in my country as an American.",

Clearly the world markets are reacting to the instability being caused by the US . The USA is going in a very different direction than it has for the decades of American stock market over performance . Personally I think its incredibly risky to not_have a significant international portion of anyones portfolio at this point . I have rebalanced to 6040 InternationalUS in my equities given what Im seeing happening in my country as an American ."

      "selftext": "**Current Price:** \\~GBX 123 / CAD 2.29 **Market Cap:** \\~£580m / CAD 1.06B Amaroq just transitioned from a developer to a producer, beating its FY2025 production guidance during a commissioning year. You are buying a high-grade gold mine that is ramping up exactly as major banks (JPM, Goldman) forecast gold to hit $4,000-$5,000/oz in 2026. The kicker? The US government is actively looking to invest in Greenland to counter China, and Amaroq holds the keys to the region's copper and strategic minerals. **1. The Cash Flow Engine is Live** Most junior miners fail because they can't build the mine. Amaroq has crossed that bridge. * **Production Beat:** They just reported FY2025 production of \\~6,600 oz, beating the midpoint of their 6-7koz guidance. * **High Grade:** This is a narrow-vein deposit with historical grades of 18-28 g/t.High grade protects margins if prices dip. * **Phase 2 Catalyst:** The real re-rate happens in Q2 2026. They are installing a flotation circuit to boost recovery rates to \\~90%.This is pure margin expansion. **2. The Macro Setup (Gold Supercycle)** The valuation looks reasonable at current gold prices, but it looks like a steal if you believe the institutional consensus for 2026/2027: * **J.P. Morgan:** Forecasts $5,055/oz by Q4 2026. * **Bank of America:** Sees upside to $5,000/oz.If gold goes to $4,000+, Amaroq's free cash flow from the Nalunaq mine alone could likely self-fund their massive exploration portfolio, eliminating the need for dilution. **3. The Geopolitical \"Put\" Option** This is the unique value driver. The US is scrambling to secure critical minerals outside of China's control. * **Strategic Assets:** Amaroq owns the Sava Copper Belt (potential IOCG system) and Stendalen (Nickel/PGM). * **US Government Funding:** CEO Eldur Olafsson confirmed they are in discussions with US agencies regarding direct investment and infrastructure support. * **The Moat:** If the US wants Greenland's minerals, Amaroq is the primary industrial partner in the region. **Valuation & Asymmetry** The stock trades like a developer, but the risk profile has shifted to that of a producer. You are effectively paying for the gold mine and getting the copper/strategic minerals and the \"US National Security\" premium for free. **Key Risks** * **Nugget Effect:** The gold is coarse and erratic. Quarterly production will be volatile. You have to look at annual averages, not quarterly misses/beats. * **Execution:** They need to deliver Phase 2 on time (Q2 2026) to hit the 90% recovery targets. * **Logistics:** It's the Arctic. Weather can delay shipments and increase working capital requirements.",

You are buying a highgrade gold mine that is ramping up exactly as major banks JPM Goldman forecast gold to hit $ 4000 $ 5000oz in 2026 . The kicker The US government is actively looking to invest in Greenland to counter China and Amaroq holds the keys to the regions copper and strategic minerals . 1 . The Cash Flow Engine is Live Most junior miners fail because they cant build the mine . Amaroq has crossed that bridge . Production Beat They just reported FY2025 production of 6600 oz beating the midpoint of their 67koz guidance . High Grade This is a narrowvein deposit with historical grades of 1828 gt.High grade protects margins if prices dip . Phase 2 Catalyst The real rerate happens in Q2 2026 . They are installing a flotation circuit to boost recovery rates to 90 % .This is pure margin expansion . 2 . The Macro Setup Gold Supercycle The valuation looks reasonable at current gold prices but it looks like a steal if you believe the institutional consensus for 20262027 J.P. Morgan Forecasts $ 5055oz by Q4 2026 . Bank of America Sees upside to $ 5000oz.If gold goes to $ 4000 Amaroqs free cash flow from the Nalunaq mine alone could likely selffund their massive exploration portfolio eliminating the need for dilution . 3 . The Geopolitical Put Option This is the unique value driver . The US is scrambling to secure critical minerals outside of Chinas control . Strategic Assets Amaroq owns the Sava Copper Belt potential IOCG system and Stendalen NickelPGM . US Government Funding CEO Eldur Olafsson confirmed they are in discussions with US agencies regarding direct investment and infrastructure support . The Moat If the US wants Greenlands minerals Amaroq is the primary industrial partner in the region . Valuation Asymmetry The stock trades like a developer but the risk profile has shifted to that of a producer . You are effectively paying for the gold mine and getting the copperstrategic minerals and the US National Security premium for free . Key Risks Nugget Effect The gold is coarse and erratic . Quarterly production will be volatile . You have to look at annual averages not_quarterly missesbeats . Execution They need to deliver Phase 2 on time Q2 2026 to hit the 90 % recovery targets . Logistics Its the Arctic . Weather can delay shipments and increase working capital requirements ."

      "selftext": "On January 14, spot silver surged past $92/oz, up nearly 6% on the day. New York silver also jumped about 6% to $91.57/oz. So far this year, silver is already up around 25%. The rally in precious metals has been driven by rising expectations for Fed rate cuts after the release of the December CPI data, along with ongoing physical supply shortages. I’ve also noticed industrial metals moving higher at the same time. Tin was up nearly 40% last year, and is already up more than 25% so far in 2026. Indonesia is the world’s second largest tin producer how do people view that market? Do you think this move is just a CPI-driven panic spike or is it more of a real stress test for U.S. equities with capital rotating out of stocks and into precious metals as a safe haven? Is this part of a bigger longer term trend?",

Before this though, I solely just invested in Robinhood but that was before I was financially more literate. I’m trying to rebalance my portfolio because I should have done this much sooner. I just want to hear some opinions on it. I’m taking each with a grain of salt or heavy research after. My approach Roth IRA = growth stocks (VTI, SPY, VOO) Robinhood = Income Focused (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI) The plan is to retire off of dividends but also have a good savings account. I’m currently 25 and my income is nothing fancy. My robinhood is roughly reaching 20k but that’s because so have a good mix of growth stocks and dividend stocks in it.",

You know what is out of fashion? Competence. You know what is in fashion? Organized crime syndicates stealing off Americans to give plane tickets to foreigners so they can fly into JFK in Business Class for $35. And you know who is letting it happen? Alaska Airlines - they know *all about it* but refuses to tell anyone because they are terrified of their own stock chart. This isn't an airline. It is a distressed fintech with planes attached, run by cowards who are actively helping criminals cross the border to save their quarterly bonus. **I am Short Alaska Airlines. Here is the dirt.** But if your smooth-brains don't want to read or think, just jam this [report]( into your AI and ask it if this is the ravings of a lunatic? It will tell you to short at the double. # 1. The \"Penalty Box\" Infinite Loop (Tech is F*cked) In 2022, some poor guy had his mileage account drained so a random dude could travel in luxury. It was a last-minute ticket, and the hackers changed the notification email so the victim never knew until it was too late. ALK agreed to give his points back as a \"one-time courtesy,\" but then punished the **victim** by permanently banning them from booking online. They have to call a phone line (open 9-5) to use their own points forever. Fast forward 4 years to 2026. They haven't fixed a single line of code. It is the exact same robbery. Exact same response. Only now, hackers are running a train on Alaska. Look at the scoreboard: 370 confirmed hacks on public forums in 2025. \"370? Who cares?\" you ask, wiping Cheeto dust on your wife's boyfriend's couch. Listen to me. More than half of those came from the absolute nerdiest end of mile-sniffers. 41 came from a niche Chinese-language chat room (US Card Forum) with only 12,000 weekly visitors. That is the tip of the iceberg. If 41 guys in a tiny Chinese forum got hit, the real number across the 12 million normies who don't check their accounts daily is in the **tens of thousands**. An airline with tech so jacked they can't even stop randomers on the other side of the world from switching your email has no place in the modern world. # 2. The \"This is America\" Factor Now, I'm not a complete moron. I know how this works. Leaking 100,000s of data points and letting your best customers get beaten up as scapegoats? Ha, this is America. Nobody will care about that. Equifax leaked the whole country and the stock went up. But this is more than that. # 3. The Accounting Riddle Things gets worse. The filings around the loyalty program have got lumps all over them too. ALK Market Cap: $5.5B. ALK Loyalty Scheme Value: $12B (2024 investor day said so). Bungle the loyalty scheme, the easiest free money printer you can dream of, and everything goes with it. Watch how they show the world they have no control of it. The Q2 2025 Surprise: ALK suddenly booked a $180M spike in loyalty liabilities out of nowhere. No revenue match. Just $180M dropped from the sky. The Receivables Game: In the same quarter, their receivables from Bank of America (their credit card daddy) spiked $195M. Translation: Did Alaska tried to bill BofA for points for no reason. If they did it looks like BofA told them to pound sand. No explanation so who can say The Real Puzzle: By Q3, $120M of that receivable vanished from \"Current Assets\" and wormed its way into \"Other Non-Current Assets.\" Looks like something is being put in the basement hoping the SEC won't check the storage locker. Spoiler: They will. # 4. The Unapprehended Traveler (The Kill Shot) This is the part that should put someone in handcuffs. And make the stock rock soon. Right now - literally today - there is almost certainly a foreign national jetting in on some poor Alaskan's hard-earned miles. So hard-earned that our hero victim actually spotted it! He called up Alaska! *\"Hey! There is a thief in seat 4A flying to Seattle right now!\"* The thief must be a daredevil to take that risk, right? Wait until CBP takes him out back... **NOPE.** It doesn't happen. The thief isn't brave; he's safe. **Because Alaska never tells anyone.** There are cases where victims begged Alaska to call the police on a fraudster *who was literally in the air*, and Alaska refused. Why? Because an arrest creates a Police Report. A Police Report creates a Public Record. A Public Record proves a Data Breach. A Breach crashes the Stock. They are choosing to facilitate organized crime and border violations just to keep the share price propped up. How you think the Trumpisters gonna play this when they find out... # The Play The assets are unexplained ($180M apparition). The tech is broken (no 2FA). The governance is cowardly (hiding the breach).

You know what is out of fashion Competence . You know what is in fashion Organized crime syndicates stealing off Americans to give plane tickets to foreigners so they can fly into JFK in Business Class for $ 35 . And you know who is letting it happen Alaska Airlines they know all about it but refuses to tell anyone because they are terrified of their own stock chart . This isnt an airline . It is a distressed fintech with planes attached run by cowards who are actively helping criminals cross the border to save their quarterly bonus . I am Short Alaska Airlines . Here is the dirt . But if your smoothbrains dont want to read or think just jam this report into your AI and ask it if this is the ravings of a lunatic It will tell you to short at the double . 1 . The Penalty Box Infinite Loop Tech is Fcked In 2022 some poor guy had his mileage account drained so a random dude could travel in luxury . It was a lastminute ticket and the hackers changed the notification email so the victim never_knew until it was too late . ALK agreed to give his points back as a onetime courtesy but then punished the victim by permanently banning them from booking online . They have to call a phone line open 95 to use their own points forever . Fast forward 4 years to 2026 . They havent fixed a single line of code . It is the exact same robbery . Exact same response . Only now hackers are running a train on Alaska . Look at the scoreboard 370 confirmed hacks on public forums in 2025 . 370 Who cares you ask wiping Cheeto dust on your wifes boyfriends couch . Listen to me . More than half of those came from the absolute nerdiest end of milesniffers . 41 came from a niche Chineselanguage chat room US Card Forum with only 12000 weekly visitors . That is the tip of the iceberg . If 41 guys in a tiny Chinese forum got hit the real number across the 12 million normies who dont check their accounts daily is in the tens of thousands . An airline with tech so jacked they cant even stop randomers on the other side of the world from switching your email has no_place in the modern world . 2 . The This is America Factor Now Im not_a complete moron . I know how this works . Leaking 100000s of data points and letting your best customers get beaten up as scapegoats Ha this is America . Nobody_will care about that . Equifax leaked the whole country and the stock went up . But this is more than that . 3 . The Accounting Riddle Things gets worse . The filings around the loyalty program have got lumps all over them too . ALK Market Cap $ 5.5B . ALK Loyalty Scheme Value $ 12B 2024 investor day said so . Bungle the loyalty scheme the easiest free money printer you can dream of and everything goes with it . Watch how they show the world they have no_control of it . The Q2 2025 Surprise ALK suddenly booked a $ 180M spike in loyalty liabilities out of nowhere_No revenue match . Just $ 180M dropped from the sky . The Receivables Game In the same quarter their receivables from Bank of America their credit card daddy spiked $ 195M . Translation Did Alaska tried to bill BofA for points for no_reason . If they did it looks like BofA told them to pound sand . No_explanation so who can say The Real Puzzle By Q3 $ 120M of that receivable vanished from Current Assets and wormed its way into Other NonCurrent Assets . Looks like something is being put in the basement hoping the SEC wont check the storage locker . Spoiler They will . 4 . The Unapprehended Traveler The Kill Shot This is the part that should put someone in handcuffs . And make the stock rock soon . Right now literally today there is almost certainly a foreign national jetting in on some poor Alaskans hardearned miles . So hardearned that our hero victim actually spotted it He called up Alaska Hey There is a thief in seat 4A flying to Seattle right now The thief must be a daredevil to take that risk right Wait until CBP takes him out back ... NOPE . It doesnt happen . The thief isnt brave hes safe . Because Alaska never_tells anyone . There are cases where victims begged Alaska to call the police on a fraudster who was literally in the air and Alaska refused . Why Because an arrest creates a Police Report . A Police Report creates a Public Record . A Public Record proves a Data Breach . A Breach crashes the Stock . They are choosing to facilitate organized crime and border violations just to keep the share price propped up . How you think the Trumpisters gon na play this when they find out ... The Play The assets are unexplained $ 180M apparition . The tech is broken no 2FA . The governance is cowardly hiding the breach . Positions proof 400x ALK Apr 17 2026 $ 32.50 Puts $ 0.59 250x ALK Apr 17 2026 $ 37.50 Puts $ 1.09 500x ALK Apr 17 2026 $ 40.00 Puts $ 1.45 200x ALK Apr 17 2026 $ 45.00 Puts $ 2.63 Total premium at risk $ 175k EDITED TO ADD DONT FORGET YOU DONT HAVE MANY BRAIN CELLS . DONT WASTE THEM AND WANG THE FULL THESIS DOWN YOUR LOCAL AI HERE"

      "selftext": "**USAR: 90% convinced, need a gut check before sizing up** Started a small position today at $16.58. Everything says this should be bigger. Talk me out of it. **What they do:** USA Rare Earth owns Round Top Mountain in Texas. Only major domestic deposit of heavy rare earths - dysprosium and terbium. These go into every F-35 (920 lbs per plane), EV motor, wind turbine, missile guidance system. China controls 99% of global heavy rare earth processing. **Why now:** * Trump talking about Greenland for rare earth deposits * China suspended export controls until November 2026. When they come back, this becomes critical infrastructure * Stillwater, Oklahoma magnet facility starts production Q1 2026 * Acquired Less Common Metals for $100M in November - only scaled rare earth metal producer outside China **Numbers:** * $5.56 to $43.98 in 2025, now $16-17. Down 60% from highs * $2.5B market cap. MP Materials is $10B with $400M DoD backing * Pre-revenue, burning $10-15M quarterly, $523M cash * All Buy ratings, average target $23 **Bull case:** * MP got $400M government equity. USAR CEO says \"in close communication with administration\" * Round Top is 70% heavy rare earths. MP is light rare earths. Different products, both needed * Stillwater revenue starts Q1 2026. First proof they can produce * China export restrictions return November 2026 **Bear case:** * Stillwater was supposed to produce in 2023, now 2026 * 211% dilution in 2025. More coming * MP already operational, profitable, government-backed * No confirmed government money yet **What I need:** Am I missing something on the bear case? Is dilution worse than I think? Wait for Stillwater confirmation? **Position:** 257 shares at $16.58. Considering 500-1000 more to hit 5-7% of portfolio.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’ve been reading a lot of posts on Reddit lately about platforms like eToro, Interactive Brokers, Trading212, etc., with people reporting things like: - accounts being frozen or closed; - slow or unresponsive customer service; - difficulty withdrawing funds; - limited explanations during “reviews”. As a long-term retail investor, this honestly makes me uneasy. Many of us are investing years of savings, trusting these platforms to hold our assets while we build wealth over decades. I’m trying to separate real systemic risk from isolated cases, compliance issues, and I’d really appreciate hearing from more experienced investors. Some genuine questions I have: What actual legal protections do retail investors have if a broker freezes or closes an account? How safe are client assets if a platform fails or is hacked? Are shares truly segregated and recoverable in practice? - What practical steps do experienced investors take to reduce platform risk? (multiple brokers, record-keeping, etc.) I’m not trying to bash any broker, just trying to understand how this works in the real world beyond marketing pages. Would love to hear: Personal experiences good or bad; Insights from people who’ve dealt with compliance reviews; Views from anyone with legal, regulatory, or professional investing background. Let’s keep it constructive, I think this is something a lot of quiet investors worry about but don’t always ask. Thanks in advance",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone I ’ ve been reading a lot of posts on Reddit lately about platforms like eToro Interactive Brokers Trading212 etc . with people reporting things like accounts being frozen or closed slow or unresponsive customer service difficulty withdrawing funds limited explanations during “ reviews ” . As a longterm retail investor this honestly makes me uneasy . Many of us are investing years of savings trusting these platforms to hold our assets while we build wealth over decades . I ’ m trying to separate real systemic risk from isolated cases compliance issues and I ’ d really appreciate hearing from more experienced investors . Some genuine questions I have What actual legal protections do retail investors have if a broker freezes or closes an account How safe are client assets if a platform fails or is hacked Are shares truly segregated and recoverable in practice What practical steps do experienced investors take to reduce platform risk multiple brokers recordkeeping etc . I ’ m not_trying to bash any broker just trying to understand how this works in the real world beyond marketing pages . Would love to hear Personal experiences good or bad Insights from people who ’ ve dealt with compliance reviews Views from anyone with legal regulatory or professional investing background . Let ’ s keep it constructive I think this is something a lot of quiet investors worry about but don ’ t always ask . Thanks in advance"

      "selftext": "Secretary of Defense, Hegseth’s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports. \"While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,\" Hegseth said in the video online. \"Not anymore.\" The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by \"approving hundreds of American products\" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a \"variety of low-cost drones\" made by American engineers and AI experts. The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use. \"Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,\" the memo said. Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars. \"Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,\" Hegseth wrote in the memo. The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace. In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones part of the SRR contract, which the budget has increased from 70M to 800M. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue. Following news today, RedCat’s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat’s drones. They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options a few months ago. In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue. There is also speculation that RedCat’s Black Widow involving its visual navigation thanks to Palantir strategic partnership was used to help capture Maduro with its anti-jamming technology. They are also tapping in the USV, which I’m sure you’ve heard about as many russian vessels were taken down by these sea drones. Guess which compared acquired that exact product known as the Magura7 and started production in its brand new facility in Georgia? Yup. RedCat. TLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract. Has connections to current administration. Approved for NATO. Tapped into USV industry. Speculating to be used for the capture of Maduro. 1,800% YoY increase in revenue I am 15k shares long.",

      "selftext_processed": "Secretary of Defense Hegseth ’ s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no_brainer . The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies . It also assigns to combat units authority to buy test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes according to reports . While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape Hegseth said in the video online . Not anymore . The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by approving hundreds of American products for military purchase . It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry . The DOD plans to arm combat units with a variety of lowcost drones made by American engineers and AI experts . The order will also expand the Blue List of DODapproved unmanned drones components and software as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency according to reports . The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use . Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops the memo said . Lastly the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year which includes forceonforce drone wars . Lethality will not_be hindered by selfimposed restrictions especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue Hegseth wrote in the memo . The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace . In December alone they delivered 641 systemsdrones part of the SRR contract which the budget has increased from 70M to 800M . And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1800 % YoY revenue . Following news today RedCat ’ s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat ’ s drones . They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options a few months ago . In December alone they delivered 641 systemsdrones . And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1800 % YoY revenue . There is also speculation that RedCat ’ s Black Widow involving its visual navigation thanks to Palantir strategic partnership was used to help capture Maduro with its antijamming technology . They are also tapping in the USV which I ’ m sure you ’ ve heard about as many russian vessels were taken down by these sea drones . Guess which compared acquired that exact product known as the Magura7 and started production in its brand new facility in Georgia Yup . RedCat . TLDR Drone warfare is here .

It worked… in the past. \\[See image originally published in [ \\] But the world is quite different now - may more investors (educated or uneducated), many more interests, many more opportunities, different ways to get returns (think about e-Commerce, investing in fractional shares of Real Estate, etc). And, especially, I feel there are more companies getting listed now, and back then only the solid one would make it. Not that it prevented them from falling or failing, but at least there was more structure to that. So… I'm not implying that “**stocks are dead**” as I'm quite invested in that. Just wondering if we’re confusing a great historical run with a permanent law of nature. * Are stocks **still** “the best” because they’re inherently superior, or because the system is now designed to keep them afloat? * Do future returns look anything like the past? * Or are we just anchoring to a history that will not repeat so similarly? * Where does Crypto sit in this equation? And especially: * What other asset, if not stocks, would you see as a winner - or at least as a close competitor to Stocks?",

I believe that with years of trading experience, there’s a lot of wisdom and unique perspectives to share, and I’m eager to exchange ideas and learn from others. A little about myself: I’m 60 years old and have been trading for quite a while. About 50% of my portfolio is in blue chip stocks, but I also like to experiment with growth stocks, tech stocks, and even some small-cap stocks (I know it’s quite aggressive for me, but I keep it within what I’m comfortable with). I’m looking for like minded friends to chat with and perhaps exchange some investment strategies and stocks we’re bullish on. And if we happen to be in the same city, grabbing a drink together would be a great option too!",

A little about myself I ’ m 60 years old and have been trading for quite a while . About 50 % of my portfolio is in blue chip stocks but I also like to experiment with growth stocks tech stocks and even some smallcap stocks I know it ’ s quite aggressive for me but I keep it within what I ’ m comfortable with . I ’ m looking for like minded friends to chat with and perhaps exchange some investment strategies and stocks we ’ re bullish on . And if we happen to be in the same city grabbing a drink together would be a great option too"

Based on some quick research, here is roughly what I’m thinking but would love to hear feedback / advice. Mainly looking at fidelity ETFs that seem to have no or little management fees: 50% FZROX (basically VOO but no fees?) 20% FZILX (international emerging markets with no fees) 20% FTEC (fidelity tech etf) 10% FESM (fidelity small cap) What are your thoughts on this?

      "selftext": "Hello, Investors: I am going to set up a brokerage account this year to house saved funds for my soon-to-be-born daughter's college fund, and \"retirement\" funds for my wife and me. All of my experience with the stock market is in swing trading individual tickers (no options, futures, forex or crypto), which has been very successful for me. But I see swing trading as a way to pull funds out of the market (income), and not a a smart way to store wealth for long term growth (savings). My plan is to pick one broad spectrum ETF and to DCA into that one ticker for the next 18 (for college fund) to 30 (for \"retirement\" fund) years. I personally think it is a waste of money for us to use a financial planner since I have educated myself on the markets, and long-term family planning. Currently I am torn between VT and VTI. Do you have any opinion on either ETF? Please share your opinions on which ETFs you have experience with, and any experience you have had with a similar plan. Also, please let me know if it looks like I am missing something here. I don't want to fall into a trap just because I don't know what I don't know. NOTE: I am not seeking any *advice*. I am merely curious as to your experiences and opinions so that I can use that information as another data point in my research and planning. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great day.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello Investors I am going to set up a brokerage account this year to house saved funds for my soontobeborn daughters college fund and retirement funds for my wife and me . All of my experience with the stock market is in swing trading individual tickers no options futures forex or crypto which has been very successful for me . But I see swing trading as a way to pull funds out of the market income and not_a a smart way to store wealth for long term growth savings . My plan is to pick one broad spectrum ETF and to DCA into that one ticker for the next 18 for college fund to 30 for retirement fund years . I personally think it is a waste of money for us to use a financial planner since I have educated myself on the markets and longterm family planning . Currently I am torn between VT and VTI . Do you have any opinion on either ETF Please share your opinions on which ETFs you have experience with and any experience you have had with a similar plan . Also please let me know if it looks like I am missing something here . I dont want to fall into a trap just because I dont know what I dont know . NOTE I am not_seeking any advice . I am merely curious as to your experiences and opinions so that I can use that information as another data point in my research and planning . Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great day ."

      "title": "$UBER Autonomous Vehicle fears is the same story as Search Ai fears for $GOOGL was.",
      "selftext": "$UBER is currently pretty beaten down due to AV (Autonomous Vehicle) fears. It’s currently trading at a Forward P/E of x25. The market is pricing $UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy. I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year, where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly, fears of search AI taking over Google search. In a similar fashion, I believe AV is not here as Uber’s competition, rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV’s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact. Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo, and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together. Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US, with 1 city partnering with Lyft, 2 with Uber, and the remaining 2 with themselves, constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution, market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out. If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it, the upside story looks quite convincing. This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not end up being a winner take all market, rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player. But with the TAM for AVs being so large, and the payback period for AVs being so high currently, it’ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does. I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement, hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 30-35P/E as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets. Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out, and Uber is left in the dust with no partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out, so will their gross bookings. However, I’m not particularly worried. They’ve partnered with Nvidia, they’ve partnered with Avride, Costco, even Sephora. Feels like something will stick. [Position: 4 LEAPS, waiting for multiples expansion to take profit]( Yes I know their current P/E of \\~10 is fake due to tax reasons. TLDR: Buy Uber, AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor.",

      "selftext_processed": "$ UBER is currently pretty beaten down due to AV Autonomous Vehicle fears . It ’ s currently trading at a Forward PE of x25 . The market is pricing $ UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy . I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly fears of search AI taking over Google search . In a similar fashion I believe AV is not_here as Uber ’ s competition rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV ’ s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact . Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together . Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US with 1 city partnering with Lyft 2 with Uber and the remaining 2 with themselves constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out . If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it the upside story looks quite convincing . This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not_end up being a winner take all market rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player . But with the TAM for AVs being so large and the payback period for AVs being so high currently it ’ ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does . I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 3035PE as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets . Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out and Uber is left in the dust with no_partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out so will their gross bookings . However I ’ m not_particularly worried . They ’ ve partnered with Nvidia they ’ ve partnered with Avride Costco even Sephora . Feels like something will stick . Position 4 LEAPS waiting for multiples expansion to take profit Yes I know their current PE of 10 is fake due to tax reasons . TLDR Buy Uber AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor ."

Carrying poor investing habits like stock picking, speculation, market timing, and using trading tools like options, margin, leverage into your later years will be too dangerous and costly since you lose the ability to recover from financial losses. While any portfolio can go up by a million percent, it can only go down by 100 percent. So a portfolio should be defensive in nature. It's better to have good investment habits that last your life time than be rewarded early on in your life with your poor investment habits which then turn to destroy you in the end.",

Carrying poor investing habits like stock picking speculation market timing and using trading tools like options margin leverage into your later years will be too dangerous and costly since you lose the ability to recover from financial losses . While any portfolio can go up by a million percent it can only go down by 100 percent . So a portfolio should be defensive in nature . Its better to have good investment habits that last your life time than be rewarded early on in your life with your poor investment habits which then turn to destroy you in the end ."
